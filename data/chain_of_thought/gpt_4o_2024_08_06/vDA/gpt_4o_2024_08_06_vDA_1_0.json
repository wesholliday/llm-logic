            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolized as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" symbolized as \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg M \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg S \\)\n\nTo determine if this argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In logic, an argument is valid if, whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThe form of this argument is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a common logical fallacy. In this form, the argument assumes that if the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is false, then the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be false. However, this is not a valid inference. The truth of the consequent is not dependent solely on the truth of the antecedent. There could be other reasons for Sue to be at the wedding, independent of Mary's presence.\n\nFor example, even if Mary was not at the wedding (\\( \\neg M \\)), Sue could still have been at the wedding for other reasons. The premises do not provide enough information to conclude that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
