            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is the negation of Q, which can be represented as:\n   - Not Q (\u00acQ).\n\nIn logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if you have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), you can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). In simpler terms, if \"If P then Q\" is true, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n- We have P \u2192 Q: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n- We have \u00acQ: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n\nFrom these, we can infer \u00acP: \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
