            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This is the negation of \\( Q \\), which can be represented as:\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Sue did not choose pizza,\" which is the negation of \\( P \\), represented as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know that \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, you can infer \\( \\neg P \\). This is because if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would have to be true (according to the conditional statement), but since \\( Q \\) is not true (\\( \\neg Q \\)), \\( P \\) cannot be true.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n- We have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (\"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\").\n- We also have \\( \\neg Q \\) (\"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\").\n\nFrom these, we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (\"Sue did not choose pizza\").\n\nAnswer: yes",
