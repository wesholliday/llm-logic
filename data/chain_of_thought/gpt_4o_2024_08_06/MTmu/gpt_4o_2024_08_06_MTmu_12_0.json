            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If P (Joe went to the park), then Q (Lucy must have gone to the zoo).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be represented as:\n   - Not Q (Lucy did not go to the zoo).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" (Not P) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the rule of modus tollens allows us to infer the negation of the antecedent from the negation of the consequent in a conditional statement. The rule is as follows:\n- If we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"Not Q,\" we can conclude \"Not P.\"\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n- We have \"If P, then Q\" (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo).\n- We also have \"Not Q\" (It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, from these two premises, we can infer \"Not P\" (Joe did not go to the park).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
