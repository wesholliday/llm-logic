            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants must have been denim.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This is equivalent to saying \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" (the negation of the consequent), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"not P\" (the negation of the antecedent). Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as:\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. If the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants must have been denim (Q).\n2. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim (not Q).\n3. Therefore, the shirt was not cotton (not P).\n\nThus, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
