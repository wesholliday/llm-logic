            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This is a negation of Q, which can be represented as \"not Q.\"\n\nIn formal logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" is true, we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"not P.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that allows us to conclude the negation of the antecedent (P) if the consequent (Q) is false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel).\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel).\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n3. Not P (The book was not written by James).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
