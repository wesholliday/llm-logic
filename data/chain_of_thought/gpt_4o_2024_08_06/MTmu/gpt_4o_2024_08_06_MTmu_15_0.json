            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin must have taken a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of Q:\n   - Not Q (\u00acQ).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Sam did not take a plane\" (\u00acP) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if you have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), you can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). This can be written as:\n- If (P \u2192 Q) and (\u00acQ), then (\u00acP).\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n- We have (P \u2192 Q): \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\"\n- We also have (\u00acQ): \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\"\n\nAccording to modus tollens, from these two premises, we can infer (\u00acP): \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
