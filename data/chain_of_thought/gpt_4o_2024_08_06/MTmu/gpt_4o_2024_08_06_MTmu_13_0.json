            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck must have been blue.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This is a negation of Q, which can be represented as \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" is true, we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"not P.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that allows us to conclude the negation of the antecedent (P) if the consequent (Q) is false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. \"If the car was red (P), then the truck must have been blue (Q).\"\n2. \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue (not Q).\"\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n3. \"The car was not red (not P).\"\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
