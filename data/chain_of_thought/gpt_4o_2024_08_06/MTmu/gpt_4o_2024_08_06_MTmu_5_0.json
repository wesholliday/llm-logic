            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If J (Jeff played basketball), then A (Amy must have played tennis).\n   - Symbolically, this is: J \u2192 A.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This is a negation of the conclusion of the first statement.\n   - Symbolically, this is: \u00acA.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball\" from these statements.\n\n3. In logic, if we have a conditional statement J \u2192 A and we know that \u00acA is true, we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \u00acJ (Jeff did not play basketball). Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as:\n   - If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\n4. Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - We have J \u2192 A (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis).\n   - We also have \u00acA (It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis).\n\n5. By modus tollens, from J \u2192 A and \u00acA, we can infer \u00acJ (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the statements and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
