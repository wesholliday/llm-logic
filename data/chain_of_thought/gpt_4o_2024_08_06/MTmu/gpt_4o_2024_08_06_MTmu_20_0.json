            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a negation of B, which can be represented as \"not B.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know \"not B\" is true, we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"not A.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as follows:\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, not A.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. If the apple was red (A), then the banana must have been yellow (B).\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow (not B).\n3. Therefore, the apple was not red (not A).\n\nThus, based on the given statements and the application of modus tollens, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
