            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark must have bought the blue shirt).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This is a negation of the conclusion of the first statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n   - Not M (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\n- The first statement (If L, then M) is a conditional statement. In logic, a conditional statement is false only when the antecedent (L) is true and the consequent (M) is false. In all other cases, the conditional statement is considered true.\n\n- The second statement (Not M) tells us that the consequent of the conditional statement is false.\n\nGiven that the consequent (M) is false, for the conditional statement (If L, then M) to hold true, the antecedent (L) must also be false. This is because if L were true, then M would have to be true for the conditional to be true, but we know M is false. Therefore, L must be false to avoid making the conditional statement false.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
