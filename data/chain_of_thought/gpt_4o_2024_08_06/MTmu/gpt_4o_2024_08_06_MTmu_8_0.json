            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and determine if the conclusion logically follows.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - V \u2192 M\n   where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy must have been awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \u00acM\n   where \u00acM means \"the mummy was not necessarily awake.\"\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake\" from these statements. In logical terms, this is represented as:\n   - \u00acV\n\nTo determine if \u00acV can be inferred, we use the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of the first statement (V \u2192 M) is:\n   - \u00acM \u2192 \u00acV\n\n5. We have \u00acM from the second statement. According to the contrapositive, if \u00acM is true, then \u00acV must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
