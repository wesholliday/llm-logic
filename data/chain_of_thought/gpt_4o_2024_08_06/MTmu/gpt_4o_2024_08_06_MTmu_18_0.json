            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n- Let P represent \"the doll was plastic.\"\n- Let M represent \"the truck must have been metal.\"\n\nThe conditional statement can be written as: P \u2192 M (If P, then M).\n\nThe second statement is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of M, which can be written as: \u00acM.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic,\" which in logical terms is \u00acP.\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement P \u2192 M and the negation of the consequent \u00acM, we can infer the negation of the antecedent \u00acP. This is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" (P \u2192 M) and \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\" (\u00acM), we can indeed infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
