            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue must have been at the wedding).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be interpreted as the negation of S, which is \u00acS (Sue was not necessarily at the wedding).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (\u00acM) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If M, then S\" (M \u2192 S) is equivalent to saying \"If M is true, then S is true.\" The only situation where this statement is false is when M is true and S is false. \n\nGiven the second statement \u00acS, we know that S is false. For the conditional statement \"If M, then S\" to hold true, M must also be false because if M were true, S would have to be true, which contradicts \u00acS.\n\nTherefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if Mary was not at the wedding (\u00acM). This is because if Mary were at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding, which contradicts the given \u00acS.\n\nThus, we can logically infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
