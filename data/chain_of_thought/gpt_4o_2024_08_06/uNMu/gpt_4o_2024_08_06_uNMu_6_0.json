            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" suggests that it is not certain or necessary that Sue chose pizza. This implies that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. The use of \"must have\" indicates a necessity or certainty, and by negating it, we are left with the possibility that the opposite could be true. Therefore, if it is not certain that Sue chose pizza, it is reasonable to infer that she might not have chosen pizza. The statement leaves open the possibility that she could have chosen something else, or she might have chosen pizza, but it is not a necessity.\n\nAnswer: yes",
