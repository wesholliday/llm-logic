            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" suggests that there is no necessity for the notebook to be in the drawer. This implies that the notebook is not required to be in the drawer, which opens up the possibility that it could be elsewhere. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the notebook might not be in the drawer, as the statement explicitly negates the necessity of its presence there. The use of \"must\" indicates a requirement or obligation, and negating this requirement means that the situation where the notebook is not in the drawer is possible.\n\nAnswer: yes",
