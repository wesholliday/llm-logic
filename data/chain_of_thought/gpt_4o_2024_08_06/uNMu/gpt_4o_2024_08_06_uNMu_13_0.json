            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" suggests that there is no absolute requirement for the toy to be in the toy box. This implies that there is a possibility for the toy to be elsewhere. The use of \"must\" indicates necessity, and negating this necessity means that the toy is not bound to be in the toy box. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the toy might not be in the toy box, as the lack of necessity allows for the possibility of the toy being outside the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
