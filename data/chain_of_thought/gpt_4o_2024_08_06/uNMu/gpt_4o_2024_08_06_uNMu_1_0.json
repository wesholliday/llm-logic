            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" suggests that there is no necessity for Mary to have been present at the wedding. This implies that her presence was not required or guaranteed. The use of \"must have been\" indicates a strong necessity or certainty, and negating it means that such certainty does not exist.\n\nWhen we say \"Mary must have been at the wedding,\" it implies that there is no possibility of her not being there. Therefore, negating this statement (\"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\") opens up the possibility that she might not have been there. It does not confirm her absence, but it allows for the possibility that she was not present.\n\nThus, from the statement given, we can infer that there is a possibility that Mary might not have been at the wedding, as the necessity of her presence is not established.\n\nAnswer: yes",
