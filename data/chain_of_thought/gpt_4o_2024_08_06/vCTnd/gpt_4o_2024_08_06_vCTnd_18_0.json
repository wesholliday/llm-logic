            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let D represent \"the issue was discussed.\"\n- Let I represent \"the issue was discussed in depth.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: D \u2192 \u00acI (If D, then not I).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\" This can be represented as:\n- I \u2192 \u00acD (If I, then not D).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In logical terms, we are checking if D \u2192 \u00acI implies I \u2192 \u00acD.\n\nOne way to check the validity is to use a truth table or logical equivalences. However, we can also reason through the implications:\n\n1. The premise D \u2192 \u00acI means that whenever D is true, I must be false. In other words, if the issue is discussed, it cannot be discussed in depth.\n\n2. The conclusion I \u2192 \u00acD means that whenever I is true, D must be false. In other words, if the issue is discussed in depth, it cannot be discussed.\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premise, consider the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of D \u2192 \u00acI is I \u2192 \u00acD. In logic, a statement is always equivalent to its contrapositive. Therefore, the conclusion I \u2192 \u00acD is logically equivalent to the premise D \u2192 \u00acI.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
