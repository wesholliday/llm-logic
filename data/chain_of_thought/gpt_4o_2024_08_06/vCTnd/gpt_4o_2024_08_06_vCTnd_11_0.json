            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables,\" which can be symbolized as \"P \u2192 \u00acQ\" where P is \"I went to the store\" and Q is \"I bought vegetables.\"\n\nThe conclusion is \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store,\" which can be symbolized as \"Q \u2192 \u00acP.\"\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The premise \"P \u2192 \u00acQ\" can be rewritten using the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"P \u2192 \u00acQ\" is \"Q \u2192 \u00acP,\" which is exactly the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and contrapositives are always logically equivalent to their original statements, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
