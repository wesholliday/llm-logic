            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let E represent \"Ann exercised.\"\n- Let S represent \"Ann exercised strenuously.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: E \u2192 \u00acS (If E, then not S).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\" This can be represented as:\n- S \u2192 \u00acE (If S, then not E).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In logical terms, we are checking if E \u2192 \u00acS implies S \u2192 \u00acE.\n\nOne way to analyze this is to consider the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of E \u2192 \u00acS is S \u2192 \u00acE, which is exactly the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and contrapositives are logically equivalent to their original statements, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
