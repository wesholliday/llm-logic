            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let P represent \"the customer was served.\"\n- Let Q represent \"the customer was served promptly.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: P \u2192 \u00acQ (If P, then not Q).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\" In logical terms, this is:\n- Q \u2192 \u00acP (If Q, then not P).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to consider the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is \u00ac\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which simplifies to Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of the premise (Q \u2192 \u00acP) is exactly the same as the conclusion (Q \u2192 \u00acP). Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
