            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let \\( G \\) represent \"the customer was greeted.\"\n- Let \\( W \\) represent \"the customer was greeted warmly.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg W \\).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted.\" This can be represented as:\n- The conclusion can be written as: \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg G \\).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to check if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nThe premise \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) states that if \\( G \\) is true, then \\( W \\) must be false. In other words, if the customer was greeted, they were not greeted warmly.\n\nThe conclusion \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg G \\) states that if \\( W \\) is true, then \\( G \\) must be false. In other words, if the customer was greeted warmly, they were not greeted.\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premise, consider the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) is \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg G \\), which is exactly the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
