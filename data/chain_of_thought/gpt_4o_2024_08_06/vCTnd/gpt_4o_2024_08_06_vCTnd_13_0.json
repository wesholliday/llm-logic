            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n- Let E represent \"Alex exercised.\"\n- Let M represent \"Alex exercised much.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: E \u2192 \u00acM (If E, then not M).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n- M \u2192 \u00acE (If M, then not E).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to check if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nThe premise E \u2192 \u00acM states that if Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much. The conclusion M \u2192 \u00acE states that if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\n\nLet's consider the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise E \u2192 \u00acM is \u00ac\u00acM \u2192 \u00acE, which simplifies to M \u2192 \u00acE. This is exactly the conclusion of the argument.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
