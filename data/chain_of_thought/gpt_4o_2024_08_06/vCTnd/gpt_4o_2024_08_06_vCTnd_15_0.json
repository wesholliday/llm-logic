            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n- Let P be \"the room was tidied.\"\n- Let Q be \"the room was tidied thoroughly.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: P \u2192 \u00acQ (If P, then not Q).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\" This can be represented as:\n- Q \u2192 \u00acP (If Q, then not P).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. \n\nThe premise P \u2192 \u00acQ states that if the room was tidied (P), then it was not tidied thoroughly (\u00acQ). The conclusion Q \u2192 \u00acP states that if the room was tidied thoroughly (Q), then it was not tidied (\u00acP).\n\nThis argument is an example of a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, in this case, the conclusion Q \u2192 \u00acP is not the contrapositive of the premise P \u2192 \u00acQ. \n\nInstead, the contrapositive of the premise P \u2192 \u00acQ would be Q \u2192 \u00acP, which is exactly the conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion is indeed the contrapositive of the premise, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
