            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let \\( C \\) represent \"the room was cleaned.\"\n- Let \\( T \\) represent \"the room was cleaned thoroughly.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\" This can be represented as:\n- \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to check if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nThe premise \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) states that if the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. This implies that whenever \\( C \\) is true, \\( T \\) must be false.\n\nThe conclusion \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) states that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned. This implies that whenever \\( T \\) is true, \\( C \\) must be false.\n\nTo check for logical validity, we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), which is exactly the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
