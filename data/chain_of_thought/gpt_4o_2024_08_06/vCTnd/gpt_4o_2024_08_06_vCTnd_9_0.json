            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. \n\nThe premise is: \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n- P \u2192 \u00acQ \nwhere P is \"instructions were given\" and Q is \"instructions were explained clearly.\"\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\" This can be represented as:\n- Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to consider the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise P \u2192 \u00acQ is:\n- Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of the premise (Q \u2192 \u00acP) is exactly the same as the conclusion. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
