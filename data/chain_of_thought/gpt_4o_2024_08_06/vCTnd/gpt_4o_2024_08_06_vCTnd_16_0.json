            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let \\( C \\) represent \"the job was completed.\"\n- Let \\( W \\) represent \"the job was completed well.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg W \\).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\" This can be represented as:\n- \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to check if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nThe premise \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) states that if the job was completed, then it was not completed well. This implies that whenever \\( C \\) is true, \\( W \\) must be false.\n\nThe conclusion \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) states that if the job was completed well, then it was not completed. This implies that whenever \\( W \\) is true, \\( C \\) must be false.\n\nTo see if the conclusion follows from the premise, consider the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) is \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), which is exactly the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
