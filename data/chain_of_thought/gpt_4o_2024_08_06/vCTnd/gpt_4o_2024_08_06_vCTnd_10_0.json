            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let A represent \"advice was offered.\"\n- Let H represent \"helpful advice was offered.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: If A, then not H (A \u2192 \u00acH).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\" In logical terms, this is:\n- If H, then not A (H \u2192 \u00acA).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to check if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nThe premise A \u2192 \u00acH can be rewritten using the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent: If H, then not A (H \u2192 \u00acA).\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of the premise (H \u2192 \u00acA) is exactly the same as the conclusion. Since the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, the conclusion is indeed a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
