            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let P represent \"Ben studied.\"\n- Let Q represent \"Ben studied diligently.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: P \u2192 \u00acQ (If P, then not Q).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\" This can be represented as:\n- Q \u2192 \u00acP (If Q, then not P).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to check if the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, as a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise P \u2192 \u00acQ is \u00ac\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which simplifies to Q \u2192 \u00acP. This is exactly the form of the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premise because they are equivalent statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
