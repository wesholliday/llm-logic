            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let \\( R \\) represent \"it's raining.\"\n- Let \\( H \\) represent \"it's raining hard.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\" This can be represented as:\n- \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In logical terms, we want to see if \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\) implies \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\).\n\nLet's analyze this:\n\n1. The premise \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\) means that whenever it is raining (\\( R \\) is true), it is not raining hard (\\( H \\) is false).\n\n2. The conclusion \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\) means that whenever it is raining hard (\\( H \\) is true), it is not raining (\\( R \\) is false).\n\nTo check the validity, consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n- The contrapositive of \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\) is \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\).\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\) is indeed the contrapositive of the premise \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\).\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
