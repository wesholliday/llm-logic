            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- P \u2192 \u00acQ\nwhere P is \"directions were provided\" and Q is \"directions were explained clearly.\"\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\" This can be represented as:\n- Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\nTo assess the validity, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to consider the contrapositive of the premise. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is logically equivalent to the original statement and is given by:\n- Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of the premise (Q \u2192 \u00acP) is exactly the same as the conclusion. Since the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, the conclusion must be true if the premise is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
