            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let \\( P \\) be \"I ate a meal.\"\n- Let \\( Q \\) be \"I ate a large meal.\"\n- The premise is then: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\" This can be represented as:\n- The conclusion is: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to check if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nThe premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) can be rewritten using the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent:\n- The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of the premise \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is exactly the same as the conclusion. Therefore, the conclusion is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise, which means the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
