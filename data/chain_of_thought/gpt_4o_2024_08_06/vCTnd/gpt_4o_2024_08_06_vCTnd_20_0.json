            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n- Let \\( R \\) represent \"a recommendation was made.\"\n- Let \\( S \\) represent \"a strong recommendation was made.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n- The conclusion can be written as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg R \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) states that if \\( R \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must be false. The conclusion \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg R \\) states that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( R \\) must be false.\n\nThis form of argument is an example of a contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the premise \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg R \\), which is exactly the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
