            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nThe argument is asking if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This form of reasoning is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a formal fallacy. In logic, the valid forms of reasoning related to conditional statements are \"modus ponens\" (If P \u2192 Q and P, then Q) and \"modus tollens\" (If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP). However, \"denying the antecedent\" (If P \u2192 Q and \u00acP, then \u00acQ) is not a valid form of reasoning.\n\nTo illustrate why this is invalid, consider a counterexample: Suppose the book was not written by James, but it is still a mystery novel because someone else wrote it. The premise does not provide any information about what happens if the book was not written by James, so the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
