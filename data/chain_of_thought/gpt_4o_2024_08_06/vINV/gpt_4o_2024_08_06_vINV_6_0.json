            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument is asking whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This form of argument is known as the \"contrapositive.\" In logic, the contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). A key property of logical conditionals is that a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. However, the conclusion given here is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), which is not the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nInstead, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is the inverse of the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is not valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
