            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n- Let B represent \"the bear was in the cave.\"\n- Let W represent \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n- The premise can be written as: B \u2192 W (If B, then W).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\" This can be represented as:\n- \u00acB represents \"the bear was not in the cave.\"\n- \u00acW represents \"the wolf was not in the den.\"\n- The conclusion can be written as: \u00acB \u2192 \u00acW (If \u00acB, then \u00acW).\n\nThe argument is asking if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This form of argument is known as the \"inverse\" of the original implication. In logic, the inverse of an implication (B \u2192 W) is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acW.\n\nTo determine if this is valid, we need to consider the truth table for implications:\n\n1. B is true, W is true: B \u2192 W is true, \u00acB \u2192 \u00acW is true.\n2. B is true, W is false: B \u2192 W is false, \u00acB \u2192 \u00acW is true.\n3. B is false, W is true: B \u2192 W is true, \u00acB \u2192 \u00acW is false.\n4. B is false, W is false: B \u2192 W is true, \u00acB \u2192 \u00acW is true.\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that the truth values of B \u2192 W and \u00acB \u2192 \u00acW do not always match. Specifically, in the case where B is false and W is true, B \u2192 W is true, but \u00acB \u2192 \u00acW is false. This shows that the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
