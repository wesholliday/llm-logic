            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be symbolized as \"J \u2192 A,\" where \"J\" represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \"A\" represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\" This can be symbolized as \"\u00acJ \u2192 \u00acA,\" where \"\u00acJ\" represents \"Jeff did not play basketball\" and \"\u00acA\" represents \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nThe argument is asking if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This form of argument is known as the \"inverse\" of the original conditional statement. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\"\n\nTo determine the validity, we need to consider the truth values:\n\n1. The original statement \"J \u2192 A\" is true unless J is true and A is false.\n2. The inverse \"\u00acJ \u2192 \u00acA\" is true unless \u00acJ is true and \u00acA is false, which means J is false and A is true.\n\nThe logical validity of an argument depends on whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion. In this case, the truth of \"J \u2192 A\" does not guarantee the truth of \"\u00acJ \u2192 \u00acA.\" This is because the truth of the original conditional does not imply the truth of its inverse. For example, it is possible for the original statement to be true (e.g., Jeff played basketball and Amy played tennis) while the inverse is false (e.g., Jeff did not play basketball, but Amy still played tennis).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not ensure the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
