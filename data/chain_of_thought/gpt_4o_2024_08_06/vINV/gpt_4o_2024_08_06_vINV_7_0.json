            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n- P \u2192 Q, where P is \"Alex finished the race\" and Q is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\" This can be represented as:\n- \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, where \u00acP is \"Alex did not finish the race\" and \u00acQ is \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\nThe argument is asking if the conclusion (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) logically follows from the premise (P \u2192 Q). This form of argument is known as the contrapositive. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of the premise P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is not the same as the conclusion \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. \n\nThe argument is actually an example of the fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" This fallacy occurs when one assumes that if the antecedent is false, then the consequent must also be false, which is not a valid logical inference.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
