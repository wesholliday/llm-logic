            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nThe argument is asking if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This form of argument is known as the \"inverse\" of the original conditional statement. In logic, the inverse of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nTo determine the validity, we need to consider the truth values:\n\n1. The original statement \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q) is true unless P is true and Q is false.\n2. The inverse \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is true unless \u00acP is true and \u00acQ is false, which means P is false and Q is true.\n\nThe inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The only forms that are logically equivalent to the original conditional statement are the contrapositive and the converse. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The converse \"If Q, then P\" (Q \u2192 P) is not logically equivalent to the original statement, just like the inverse.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
