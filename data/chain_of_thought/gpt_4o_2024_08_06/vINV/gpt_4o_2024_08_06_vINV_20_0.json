            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument is asking if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This form of argument is known as the \"inverse\" of the original conditional statement. In logic, the inverse of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo determine the validity, we need to consider the truth values:\n\n1. If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, it means whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide information about the truth value of \\( Q \\) when \\( P \\) is false.\n\n2. The inverse \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not logically equivalent to the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). The truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nFor example, consider a situation where the apple is not red (\\( \\neg P \\) is true) and the banana is yellow (\\( Q \\) is true). In this case, the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) can still be true (since it doesn't specify what happens when \\( P \\) is false), but the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) would be false because \\( \\neg Q \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not ensure the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
