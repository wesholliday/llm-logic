            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"V \u2192 M,\" where \"V\" stands for \"the vampire was awake\" and \"M\" stands for \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\" This can be represented as \"\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM,\" where \"\u00acV\" stands for \"the vampire was not awake\" and \"\u00acM\" stands for \"the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nThe argument is asking whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This is a question of whether the conclusion is a valid inference from the premise. In logic, this specific form of argument is known as the \"contrapositive.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\" It is a well-established logical principle that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive. \n\nHowever, the conclusion given here, \"\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM,\" is not the contrapositive of the premise \"V \u2192 M.\" The contrapositive of \"V \u2192 M\" would be \"\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV.\" Therefore, the conclusion \"\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM\" is not logically equivalent to the premise \"V \u2192 M.\"\n\nInstead, the conclusion \"\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM\" is the inverse of the premise \"V \u2192 M.\" In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
