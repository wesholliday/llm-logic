            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument is asking if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This form of argument is known as the \"inverse\" of the original conditional statement. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo determine if the inverse is logically valid, we need to consider the truth values:\n\n1. If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, it means whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide information about the truth value of \\( Q \\) when \\( P \\) is false.\n\n2. The inverse \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) claims that if \\( P \\) is false, then \\( Q \\) must also be false. This is not a logically valid inference from the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nThe logical validity of an argument depends on whether the conclusion must be true whenever the premises are true. In this case, the truth of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
