            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolized as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nThe argument form is asking if the premise \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) logically leads to the conclusion \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\). This form of argument is known as the \"inverse\" of the original conditional statement. In logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. The valid forms of logical equivalence related to conditionals are the \"contrapositive\" and the \"converse.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the inverse \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is not logically equivalent to \\( M \\rightarrow S \\).\n\nTo further illustrate, consider a counterexample: Suppose Mary was not at the wedding (\\( \\neg M \\)) but Sue was at the wedding (\\( S \\)). In this case, the premise \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is still true because it does not make any claim about what happens if Mary is not at the wedding. However, the conclusion \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) would be false because it claims that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding, which contradicts our counterexample.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
