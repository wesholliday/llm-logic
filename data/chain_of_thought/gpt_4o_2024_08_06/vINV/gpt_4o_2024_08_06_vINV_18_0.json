            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be symbolized as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and Q represents \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\" This can be symbolized as \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ,\" where \u00acP represents \"the doll was not plastic\" and \u00acQ represents \"the truck was not metal.\"\n\nThe argument form we are examining is known as \"contraposition.\" In logic, contraposition is a valid rule of inference. It states that a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\" However, the conclusion given in the argument is \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ,\" which is not the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nTo check the validity, let's consider the truth values:\n1. If \"P \u2192 Q\" is true, then whenever P is true, Q must also be true.\n2. The contrapositive \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\" would also be true if \"P \u2192 Q\" is true.\n3. However, \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\" is not guaranteed to be true just because \"P \u2192 Q\" is true. \n\nFor example, if the doll was not plastic (\u00acP), the original premise does not provide any information about the truck being metal or not. The truck could still be metal or not metal, independent of the doll's material, because the premise only specifies what happens if the doll is plastic.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" does not logically follow from the premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
