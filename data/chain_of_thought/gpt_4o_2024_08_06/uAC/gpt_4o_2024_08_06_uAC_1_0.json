            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If M, then S\" (M \u2192 S), where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this is simply S.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Mary was at the wedding (M) based on these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If M, then S\" (M \u2192 S) does not imply that M is true just because S is true. The truth of S does not provide any information about the truth of M. The only thing the conditional statement tells us is that if M were true, then S would also be true. However, S being true on its own does not confirm M.\n\nTherefore, even though we know that Sue was at the wedding (S is true), this does not allow us to conclude that Mary was at the wedding (M is true) based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
