            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" This statement suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. It does not assert definitively that she was absent, only that her absence is a possibility.\n\nThe conclusion is: \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\" This statement asserts that it is not necessary for Mary to have been at the wedding. In other words, it denies the necessity of her presence.\n\nTo evaluate the logical validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. If the premise is true (i.e., there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding), then it logically follows that it cannot be the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. If there is even a possibility of her absence, then her presence cannot be necessary.\n\nIn formal logic, the premise \"might not\" implies the negation of \"must.\" If something might not be the case, then it is not necessarily the case. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is a necessary consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
