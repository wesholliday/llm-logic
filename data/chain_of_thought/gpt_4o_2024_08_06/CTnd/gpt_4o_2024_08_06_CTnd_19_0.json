The original statement P \u2192 \u00acQ is equivalent to its contrapositive, which is Q \u2192 \u00acP. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided\" (Q \u2192 \u00acP) is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly\" (P \u2192 \u00acQ). Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer the statement Q \u2192 \u00acP from P \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nAnswer: yes",
