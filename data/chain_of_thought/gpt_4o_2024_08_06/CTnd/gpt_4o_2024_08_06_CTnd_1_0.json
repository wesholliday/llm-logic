            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the given statements, we need to understand the logical structure of the implications involved.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let P be \"it's raining.\"\n- Let Q be \"it's raining hard.\"\n\nThe statement can be written as: If P, then not Q (P \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer the statement: \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\" This can be represented as:\n- If Q, then not P (Q \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement (P \u2192 \u00acQ) tells us that whenever it is raining (P is true), it is not raining hard (Q is false). This does not provide any direct information about what happens when it is raining hard (Q is true). The original statement does not imply anything about the situation when Q is true, so we cannot directly infer anything about P in that case.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of the original statement (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is (Q \u2192 \u00acP), which is exactly the statement we are trying to infer. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
