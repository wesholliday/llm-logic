The original statement P \u2192 \u00acQ is a conditional statement. The inference we are considering, Q \u2192 \u00acP, is the converse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. The converse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, from the original statement \"If P, then not Q,\" we cannot validly infer \"If Q, then not P.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
