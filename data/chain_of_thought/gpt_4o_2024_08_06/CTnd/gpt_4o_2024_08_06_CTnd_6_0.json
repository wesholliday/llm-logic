            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether the statement \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\" can be inferred from \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\" can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let P be \"the clothes were washed.\"\n- Let Q be \"the clothes were washed properly.\"\n\nThe original statement is then: If P, then not Q (P \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: If Q, then not P (Q \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P,\" which is exactly the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
