            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the given statements, we need to understand the logical structure of the implications involved.\n\nThe original statement is: \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let P be \"Jane studied.\"\n- Let Q be \"Jane studied long.\"\n\nThe statement can be written as: If P, then not Q (P \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nWe are asked if we can infer: \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\" This can be represented as:\n- If Q, then not P (Q \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is a conditional statement. The inference we are asked to make (Q \u2192 \u00acP) is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P.\" Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThus, from the original statement \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long,\" we can indeed infer \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
