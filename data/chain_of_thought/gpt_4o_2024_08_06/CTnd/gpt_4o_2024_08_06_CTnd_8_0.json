The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is \"If B, then not A\" (B \u2192 \u00acA).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly what we are trying to infer, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
