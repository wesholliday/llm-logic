            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether the statement \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" can be inferred from \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let C represent \"the room was cleaned.\"\n- Let T represent \"the room was cleaned thoroughly.\"\n\nThe statement can be written as: If C, then not T (C \u2192 \u00acT).\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned, which can be represented as:\n- If T, then not C (T \u2192 \u00acC).\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement (C \u2192 \u00acT) is a conditional statement. The statement we want to infer (T \u2192 \u00acC) is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nTherefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true. Thus, we can infer \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" from \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
