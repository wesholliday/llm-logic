The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) is:\n- \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\nThis is exactly the statement we are trying to infer. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
