The original statement P \u2192 \u00acQ is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which means \"If I did not eat a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\"\n\nHowever, the statement we want to infer, Q \u2192 \u00acP, is not the contrapositive of the original statement. Instead, it is the converse of the original statement. The converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse (Q \u2192 \u00acP) from the original statement (P \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nAnswer: no",
