            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether the statement \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\" can be inferred from \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly\" can be written in logical terms as:\n- Let P represent \"the customer was served.\"\n- Let Q represent \"the customer was served promptly.\"\n\nThe original statement is then: If P, then not Q (P \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served. In logical terms, this is:\n- If Q, then not P (Q \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P,\" which is exactly the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
