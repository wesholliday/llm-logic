The original statement P \u2192 \u00acQ is a conditional statement, and its contrapositive is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, Q \u2192 \u00acP is not the contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ; instead, it is the inverse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. Therefore, we cannot infer Q \u2192 \u00acP from P \u2192 \u00acQ based solely on the logical structure of the statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
