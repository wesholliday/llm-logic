The original statement P \u2192 \u00acQ means that whenever P is true, Q must be false. However, it does not provide information about what happens when Q is true. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is Q \u2192 \u00acP. Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly,\" we can indeed infer \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted,\" because the latter is the contrapositive of the former.\n\nAnswer: yes",
