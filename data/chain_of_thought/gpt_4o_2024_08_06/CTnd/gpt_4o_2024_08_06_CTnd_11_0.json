            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether the statement 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store' can be inferred from 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables' can be represented in logical terms as 'P \u2192 \u00acQ', where 'P' is 'I went to the store' and '\u00acQ' is 'I did not buy vegetables'.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store', can be represented as 'Q \u2192 \u00acP', where 'Q' is 'I bought vegetables' and '\u00acP' is 'I did not go to the store'.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement 'P \u2192 \u00acQ' is 'Q \u2192 \u00acP'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables', we can infer the contrapositive 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
