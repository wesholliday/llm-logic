            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether the statement \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" can be inferred from the original statement \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement: \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"instructions were given\" and Q is \"instructions were explained clearly.\" This can be written in logical terms as P \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given,\" which can be written as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if Q \u2192 \u00acP can be inferred from P \u2192 \u00acQ, we need to consider the logical relationship between these statements. The original statement P \u2192 \u00acQ is equivalent to its contrapositive, which is Q \u2192 \u00acP. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" (Q \u2192 \u00acP) is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly\" (P \u2192 \u00acQ). Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
