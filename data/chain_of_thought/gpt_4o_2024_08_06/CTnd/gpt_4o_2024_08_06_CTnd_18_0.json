The original statement P \u2192 \u00acQ means that whenever P is true, Q must be false. However, it does not provide any information about what happens when Q is true. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is Q \u2192 \u00acP. Therefore, the statement \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed\" is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and can be inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
