The original statement (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is a conditional statement. The statement we are trying to infer (Q \u2192 \u00acP) is the converse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. The converse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, from the statement \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much,\" we cannot logically infer \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
