            "content": "Explanation: To analyze the given statements, we need to understand the logical structure of the original statement and the inference. The original statement is \"If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then not C,\" where P stands for \"the meal was prepared\" and C stands for \"the meal was prepared carefully.\"\n\nThe statement \"If P, then not C\" is a conditional statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A,\" and both are logically equivalent. Therefore, the contrapositive of \"If P, then not C\" is \"If C, then not P.\"\n\nNow, let's examine the inference: \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\" This can be represented as \"If C, then not P.\" Notice that this is exactly the contrapositive of the original statement \"If P, then not C.\"\n\nSince a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, the inference \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\" is valid based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
