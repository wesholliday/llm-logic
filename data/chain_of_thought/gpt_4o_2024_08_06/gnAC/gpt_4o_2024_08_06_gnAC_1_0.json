            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is necessarily true, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"M \u2192 S,\" where M stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S stands for \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if M is true, then S must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding,\" which means S is true.\n\nWe need to determine if these statements necessarily imply that M is true.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" does not imply that M is true just because S is true. The truth of S does not provide any information about the truth of M. The only thing the conditional tells us is that if M were true, then S would have to be true. However, S being true on its own does not confirm M.\n\nFor example, consider the following scenario: \n- If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (M \u2192 S).\n- Sue was at the wedding (S is true).\n\nThis scenario is consistent with both Mary being at the wedding (M is true) and Mary not being at the wedding (M is false). The conditional statement does not rule out the possibility that Sue was at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\nTherefore, the truth of \"Sue was at the wedding\" does not necessarily mean that \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
