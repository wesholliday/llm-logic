            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether 'The book was written by James' is necessarily true, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.' This can be represented in logical terms as 'If P, then Q,' where P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is a mystery novel.'\n\nThe second statement is 'The book is a mystery novel,' which corresponds to Q being true.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' does not imply that Q being true means P must be true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The truth of Q does not provide information about the truth of P. There could be other reasons or authors that result in the book being a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, even though the book is a mystery novel, it does not necessarily follow that the book was written by James. The book could be a mystery novel written by someone else.\n\nAnswer: no",
