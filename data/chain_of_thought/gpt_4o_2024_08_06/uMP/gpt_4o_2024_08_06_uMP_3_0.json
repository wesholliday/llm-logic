            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe second statement is a factual assertion: \"The book was written by James.\" This directly affirms the condition P in the conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can validly infer that Q is also true. This is known as \"modus ponens,\" a fundamental rule of inference in logic.\n\nApplying modus ponens to our situation:\n1. If the book was written by James (P), then the book is a mystery novel (Q).\n2. The book was written by James (P is true).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can conclude that the book is a mystery novel (Q is true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information given and the logical reasoning applied, we can infer that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
