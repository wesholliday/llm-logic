            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe second statement is a factual statement: \"The car was red.\" This confirms the condition P is true.\n\nIn logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can infer that Q must also be true. This is known as \"modus ponens,\" a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nTherefore, since the car was red (P is true), and we have the conditional statement that if the car was red, then the truck was blue (If P, then Q), we can logically conclude that the truck was blue (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
