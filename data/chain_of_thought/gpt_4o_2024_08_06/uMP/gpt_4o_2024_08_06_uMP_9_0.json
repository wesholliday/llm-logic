            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement is a factual statement: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This confirms that P is true.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can infer that Q must also be true. This is known as \"modus ponens,\" a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nSince we have established that P is true (Lisa bought the red shirt), and we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt), we can conclude that Q is true (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\nAnswer: yes",
