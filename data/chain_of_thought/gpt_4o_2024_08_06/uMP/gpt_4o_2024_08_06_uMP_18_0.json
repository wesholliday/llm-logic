            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe second statement is a factual statement: \"The doll was plastic.\" This confirms the condition P is true.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can infer that Q must also be true. This is known as \"modus ponens,\" a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nSince we have established that P (the doll was plastic) is true, and we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" (if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal), we can conclude that Q (the truck was metal) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
