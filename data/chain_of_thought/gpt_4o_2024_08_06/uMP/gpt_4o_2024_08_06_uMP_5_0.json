            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe second statement is a factual statement: \"Jeff played basketball.\" This confirms that the condition P is true.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can infer that Q must also be true. This is known as \"modus ponens,\" a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nSince we have established that Jeff played basketball (P is true), and we have the conditional statement that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (If P, then Q), we can logically conclude that Amy played tennis (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
