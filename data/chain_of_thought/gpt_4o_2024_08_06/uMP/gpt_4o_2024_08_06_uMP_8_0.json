            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If V, then M,\" where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe second statement is a simple assertion: \"The vampire was awake.\" In logical terms, this is simply \"V is true.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If V, then M\" means that whenever V is true, M must also be true. Given that the vampire was awake (V is true), we can apply the conditional statement. Since the condition (V) is met, the consequence (M) must also be true according to the rules of logic.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
