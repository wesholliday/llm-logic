            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. In logic, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nWe are also given the information that \"Mary was at the wedding,\" which means P is true.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true for the statement to hold. Since we know that P is true (Mary was at the wedding), and the conditional statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is given as true, we can logically infer that Q is true. Therefore, Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
