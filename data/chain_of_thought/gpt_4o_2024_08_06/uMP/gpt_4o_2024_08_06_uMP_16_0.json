            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe problem also states, \"the shirt was cotton,\" which means that P is true. In a conditional statement, if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true for the statement to hold. Therefore, if the shirt was indeed cotton, then according to the given conditional statement, the pants must be denim.\n\nSince both the condition (the shirt being cotton) and the rule (if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim) are satisfied, we can logically infer that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
