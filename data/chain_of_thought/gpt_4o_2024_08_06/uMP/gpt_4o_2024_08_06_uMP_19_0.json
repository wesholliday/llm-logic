            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second statement is a factual statement: \"Tom watched football.\" This confirms that the condition P is true.\n\nIn logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can infer that Q must also be true. This is known as \"modus ponens,\" a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nApplying this to our situation:\n1. We have the conditional statement: If Tom watched football (P), then Jen watched basketball (Q).\n2. We know that Tom watched football (P is true).\n\nTherefore, by modus ponens, we can conclude that Jen watched basketball (Q is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
