            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement is a factual statement: \"The apple was red.\" This confirms that P is true.\n\nIn logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can use a rule called \"modus ponens\" to conclude that Q must also be true. Modus ponens is a valid form of argument that allows us to infer the truth of the consequent (Q) if the antecedent (P) is true.\n\nApplying modus ponens to our statements:\n1. If the apple was red (P), then the banana was yellow (Q).\n2. The apple was red (P is true).\n\nFrom these, we can infer that the banana was yellow (Q is true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logical reasoning applied, we can conclude that the banana was indeed yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
