In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nThe structure of a conditional statement is such that if the first part (the antecedent, P) is true, then the second part (the consequent, Q) must also be true for the statement to hold. \n\nIn this scenario, we are given two pieces of information:\n1. \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n2. \"Sam took a plane.\"\n\nFrom the second piece of information, we know that the antecedent (P) is true. According to the rules of logic for conditional statements, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true. Therefore, if Sam indeed took a plane, then it logically follows that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: yes",
