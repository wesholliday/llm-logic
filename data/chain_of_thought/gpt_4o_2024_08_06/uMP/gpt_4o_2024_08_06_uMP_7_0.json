            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If A, then C,\" where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe second statement is a factual statement: \"Alex finished the race.\" This confirms that the condition A is true.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then C\" and we know that A is true, we can infer that C must also be true. This is known as \"modus ponens,\" a valid form of argument in propositional logic.\n\nSince we have established that A is true (Alex finished the race), and we have the conditional statement \"If A, then C\" (If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race), we can conclude that C is true (Chris finished the race).\n\nAnswer: yes",
