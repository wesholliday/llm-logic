According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether it is likely that if apples aren't the top-selling fruit, oranges will be, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. We know that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits.\n2. The data suggests that apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit this year, followed by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind.\n3. It is stated that if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. This implies a conditional relationship: if apples are not the top seller and bananas are not either, then oranges will be the top seller.\n4. Additionally, it is mentioned that it is likely apples will be the top seller, and hence bananas won\u2019t be. This suggests that the probability of apples being the top seller is high, and consequently, the probability of bananas being the top seller is low.\n\nNow, let's consider the scenario where apples are not the top-selling fruit:\n\n- If apples are not the top seller, the condition \"if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then oranges will be\" becomes relevant.\n- Since it is likely that apples will be the top seller, the probability of apples not being the top seller is low.\n- However, if apples are not the top seller, the condition implies that if bananas are also not the top seller, then oranges will be.\n\nGiven the information, the likelihood of apples not being the top seller is low, but if that unlikely event occurs, the condition suggests that oranges will be the top seller if bananas are not. The problem does not provide specific probabilities, but it does suggest a logical sequence where oranges become the top seller if both apples and bananas are not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given conditions and the logical implications, it is likely that if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be, assuming bananas are not either.\n\nAnswer: yes",
