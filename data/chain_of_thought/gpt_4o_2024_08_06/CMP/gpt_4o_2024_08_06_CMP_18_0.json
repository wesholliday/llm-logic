    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether it is likely that if pizza isn't the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Information**: We know that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. Pizza is likely to be the top takeout item, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently.\n\n2. **Conditional Statement**: The problem states that if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. This is a conditional statement that can be broken down into two parts:\n   - If burgers are not the top item, then if pizza is also not the top item, tacos will be the top item.\n\n3. **Likelihood of Pizza Leading**: It is mentioned that pizza likely will lead takeout orders, which implies that it is more probable for pizza to be the top item than for burgers or tacos.\n\n4. **Likelihood of Burgers Not Leading**: Since pizza is likely to lead, it is also likely that burgers will not be the top item. This aligns with the statement that burgers likely won\u2019t lead.\n\n5. **Implication for Tacos**: Given that it is likely that burgers are not the top item (because pizza likely is), we focus on the condition: if pizza isn\u2019t the top item, tacos will be. Since pizza is likely to be the top item, the scenario where pizza isn\u2019t the top item is less likely. However, if this less likely scenario occurs, the conditional statement tells us that tacos will be the top item.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: The problem asks if it is likely that if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be. The conditional statement directly supports this: if pizza isn\u2019t the top item, tacos will be, given that burgers aren\u2019t. Since it is likely that burgers aren\u2019t the top item (because pizza likely is), the condition holds.\n\nAnswer: yes",
