The quibble must be floob on the froodle.\n2. The quibble must be snork on the zump.\n\nThe word \"or\" in this context is typically understood as an inclusive \"or,\" meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true, but both can also be true.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is: \"The quibble must be floob on the froodle or it must be snork on the zump.\" This statement is essentially a restatement of the original, with the addition of the word \"it\" for clarity. The logical structure remains the same, as it still presents two conditions connected by an \"or.\"\n\nSince the logical meaning of the original statement is preserved in the inferred statement, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
