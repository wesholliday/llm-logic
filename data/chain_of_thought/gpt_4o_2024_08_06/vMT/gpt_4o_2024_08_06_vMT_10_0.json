            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be symbolized as: \n   - \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( D \\) represents \"the dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The cat was not outside.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   - \\( \\neg C \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The dog was not inside.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   - \\( \\neg D \\)\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg C \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg D \\)\n\nThis structure is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then you can conclude that \\( P \\) is also false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nApplying modus tollens to our argument:\n- We have \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) (if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside).\n- We have \\( \\neg C \\) (the cat was not outside).\n- Therefore, we can conclude \\( \\neg D \\) (the dog was not inside).\n\nSince the argument follows the valid logical form of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
