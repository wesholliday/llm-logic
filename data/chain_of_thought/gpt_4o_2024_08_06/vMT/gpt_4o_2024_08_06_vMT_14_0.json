            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be symbolized as: \n   - \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n   where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The wolf was not in the den.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   - \\( \\neg W \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The bear was not in the cave.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   - \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg W \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nThis structure is a classic example of a valid argument form known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a rule of logical inference that states:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if P then Q) is true,\n- and \\( \\neg Q \\) (not Q) is true,\n- then \\( \\neg P \\) (not P) must also be true.\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) is the conditional statement.\n- \\( \\neg W \\) is the negation of the consequent.\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg B \\) is the negation of the antecedent.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
