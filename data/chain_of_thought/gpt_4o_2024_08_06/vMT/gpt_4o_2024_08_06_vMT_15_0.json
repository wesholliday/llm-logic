            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be symbolized as: \n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Erin did not take a train.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sam did not take a plane.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. It states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and the negation of the consequent \\( \\neg Q \\), you can conclude the negation of the antecedent \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the modus tollens structure:\n- From \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can validly conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
