            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be symbolized as \"A \u2192 R\", where A represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and R represents \"the robot visited Jupiter\".\n\n2. The second premise is a negation: \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\" This can be symbolized as \"\u00acR\".\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The alien did not visit Mars.\" This can be symbolized as \"\u00acA\".\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: A \u2192 R\n- Premise 2: \u00acR\n- Conclusion: \u00acA\n\nThis structure is a classic example of a valid argument form known as \"modus tollens\". Modus tollens is a rule of logical inference that can be summarized as:\n- If P \u2192 Q (if P then Q)\n- \u00acQ (not Q)\n- Therefore, \u00acP (not P)\n\nIn this case:\n- P corresponds to \"the alien visited Mars\" (A)\n- Q corresponds to \"the robot visited Jupiter\" (R)\n\nThe argument follows the modus tollens form:\n- If A \u2192 R (if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter)\n- \u00acR (the robot did not visit Jupiter)\n- Therefore, \u00acA (the alien did not visit Mars)\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
