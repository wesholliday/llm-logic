            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be symbolized as \"A \u2192 C\", where \"A\" represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \"C\" represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Chris did not finish the race,\" which can be symbolized as \"\u00acC.\"\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Alex did not finish the race,\" which can be symbolized as \"\u00acA.\"\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: A \u2192 C\n- Premise 2: \u00acC\n- Conclusion: \u00acA\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. It states that if \"A \u2192 C\" is true and \"\u00acC\" is true, then \"\u00acA\" must also be true. In other words, if the consequence (C) is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false for the conditional statement to hold true.\n\nTherefore, given the premises, the conclusion logically follows. The argument is valid because it correctly applies the modus tollens rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
