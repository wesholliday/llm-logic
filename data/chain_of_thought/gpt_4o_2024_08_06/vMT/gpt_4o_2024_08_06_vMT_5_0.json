            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be symbolized as \"J \u2192 A\", where \"J\" represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \"A\" represents \"Amy played tennis\".\n\n2. The second premise is \"Amy did not play tennis\", which can be symbolized as \"\u00acA\".\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Jeff did not play basketball\", which can be symbolized as \"\u00acJ\".\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: J \u2192 A\n- Premise 2: \u00acA\n- Conclusion: \u00acJ\n\nThis structure is a classic example of a valid argument form known as \"modus tollens\". Modus tollens is a rule of logical inference that can be summarized as:\n- If \"P \u2192 Q\" (if P then Q) is true, and \"\u00acQ\" (not Q) is true, then \"\u00acP\" (not P) must also be true.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our argument:\n- We have \"J \u2192 A\" (if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis).\n- We also have \"\u00acA\" (Amy did not play tennis).\n- Therefore, we can conclude \"\u00acJ\" (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
