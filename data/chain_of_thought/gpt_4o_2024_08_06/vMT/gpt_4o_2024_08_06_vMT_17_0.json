            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Kate did not eat salad,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Ben did not eat pasta,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. It states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and the negation of the consequent \\( \\neg Q \\), you can conclude the negation of the antecedent \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the modus tollens structure:\n- From \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can validly conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it correctly applies the modus tollens rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
