            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be symbolized as: \n   - P \u2192 Q\n   where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The truck was not metal.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   - \u00acQ\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The doll was not plastic.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   - \u00acP\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q\n- Premise 2: \u00acQ\n- Conclusion: \u00acP\n\nThis structure is a classic example of a valid argument form known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a rule of logical inference that states if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that the consequent (Q) is false (\u00acQ), then the antecedent (P) must also be false (\u00acP).\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the modus tollens form:\n- From P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can validly infer \u00acP.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it correctly applies the modus tollens rule of inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
