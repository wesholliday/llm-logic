            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This is the negation of Q, symbolized as \u00acQ.\n\n3. The conclusion is \"The book was not written by James,\" which is the negation of P, symbolized as \u00acP.\n\nThe argument follows the form:\n\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q\n- Premise 2: \u00acQ\n- Conclusion: \u00acP\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens,\" which is a valid form of logical reasoning. Modus tollens states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true, and Q is false (\u00acQ), then P must also be false (\u00acP). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
