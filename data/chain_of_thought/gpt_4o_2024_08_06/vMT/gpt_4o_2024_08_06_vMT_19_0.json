            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and its contrapositive. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be symbolized as \\( T \\rightarrow J \\), where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Jen did not watch basketball,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg J \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Tom did not watch football,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg T \\).\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg J \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg T \\)\n\nThis structure is a classic example of a valid argument form known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a rule of logical inference that states if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then you can conclude that \\( P \\) is also false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nIn this case:\n- The conditional statement is \\( T \\rightarrow J \\).\n- We know \\( J \\) is false (\\( \\neg J \\)).\n- Therefore, we can conclude \\( T \\) is false (\\( \\neg T \\)).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
