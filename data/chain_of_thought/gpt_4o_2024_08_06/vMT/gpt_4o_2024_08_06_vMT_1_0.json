            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolized as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg S \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg S \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. It states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then you can conclude that \\( P \\) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nIn this case:\n- The conditional statement is \\( M \\rightarrow S \\).\n- We know \\( S \\) is false (\\( \\neg S \\)).\n- Therefore, we can conclude \\( M \\) is false (\\( \\neg M \\)).\n\nSince the argument follows the valid form of modus tollens, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
