            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be symbolized as \"G \u2192 U\", where G represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U represents \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a negation: \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" This can be symbolized as \"\u00acU\".\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be symbolized as \"\u00acG\".\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: G \u2192 U\n- Premise 2: \u00acU\n- Conclusion: \u00acG\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens,\" which is a valid form of logical reasoning. Modus tollens states that if \"P \u2192 Q\" is true and \"\u00acQ\" is true, then \"\u00acP\" must also be true. In this case:\n- \"G \u2192 U\" is analogous to \"P \u2192 Q\"\n- \"\u00acU\" is analogous to \"\u00acQ\"\n- Therefore, \"\u00acG\" is analogous to \"\u00acP\"\n\nSince the structure of the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
