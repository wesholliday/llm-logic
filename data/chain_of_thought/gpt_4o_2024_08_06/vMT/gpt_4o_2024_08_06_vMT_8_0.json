            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be symbolized as \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a negation: \"The mummy was not awake.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg V \\).\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg M \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg V \\)\n\nThis structure is a classic example of a valid argument form known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a rule of logical inference that can be summarized as:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if P then Q)\n- and \\( \\neg Q \\) (not Q)\n- then \\( \\neg P \\) (not P)\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( P \\) is \"the vampire was awake\" (\\( V \\))\n- \\( Q \\) is \"the mummy was awake\" (\\( M \\))\n\nAccording to modus tollens:\n- From \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can validly conclude \\( \\neg V \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows the modus tollens form.\n\nAnswer: yes",
