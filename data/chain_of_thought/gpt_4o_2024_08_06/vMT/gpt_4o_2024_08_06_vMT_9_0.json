            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. It states that if a conditional statement (\\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)) is accepted, and the consequent (\\( Q \\)) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then the antecedent (\\( P \\)) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the modus tollens structure:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true and \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
