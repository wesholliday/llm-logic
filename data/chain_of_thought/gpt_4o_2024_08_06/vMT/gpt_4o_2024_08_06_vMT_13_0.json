            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"The truck was not blue,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is \"The car was not red,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. It states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and the negation of the consequent \\( \\neg Q \\), you can validly conclude the negation of the antecedent \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn modus tollens, the reasoning is that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would have to be true (as per the conditional statement). However, since \\( Q \\) is not true (\\( \\neg Q \\)), \\( P \\) cannot be true either. Therefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
