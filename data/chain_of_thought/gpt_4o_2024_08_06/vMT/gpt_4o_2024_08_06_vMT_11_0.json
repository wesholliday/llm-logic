            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, which is a classic form of logical reasoning known as \"modus tollens.\"\n\nLet's break down the argument:\n\n1. First premise: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( C \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. Second premise: \"The muffins were not blueberry.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The cake was not chocolate.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg M \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nThis is a classic example of modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens states that if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then you can conclude that \\( P \\) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nIn this case:\n\n- We have \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) (if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry).\n- We have \\( \\neg M \\) (the muffins were not blueberry).\n- Therefore, we can validly conclude \\( \\neg C \\) (the cake was not chocolate).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
