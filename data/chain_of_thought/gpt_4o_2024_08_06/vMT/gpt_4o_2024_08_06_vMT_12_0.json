            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second premise is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is \"Joe did not go to the park,\" which can be symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. It states that if a conditional statement (\\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)) is accepted, and the consequent (\\( Q \\)) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then the antecedent (\\( P \\)) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the modus tollens structure:\n- From \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can validly conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
