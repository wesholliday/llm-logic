            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a negation, which is a classic form of logical reasoning known as \"modus tollens.\"\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. (This can be symbolized as: If P, then Q)\n2. Premise 2: The pants were not denim. (This can be symbolized as: Not Q)\n3. Conclusion: The shirt was not cotton. (This can be symbolized as: Not P)\n\nModus tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (Not Q), then we can conclude that P must also be false (Not P).\n\nIn this argument:\n\n- \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is the conditional statement (If P, then Q).\n- \"The pants were not denim\" is the negation of the consequent (Not Q).\n- \"The shirt was not cotton\" is the conclusion (Not P).\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens structure, it is logically valid. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
