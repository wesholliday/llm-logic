            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and its contrapositive:\n\n1. First premise: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be symbolized as \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), where \\( A \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. Second premise: \"The banana was not yellow.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The apple was not red.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nThe argument follows the form of a logical rule known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be described as follows:\n\n- If \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) (if A then B) is true,\n- and \\( \\neg B \\) (not B) is true,\n- then \\( \\neg A \\) (not A) must be true.\n\nIn this argument:\n\n- We have \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) as the first premise.\n- We have \\( \\neg B \\) as the second premise.\n- The conclusion \\( \\neg A \\) follows logically from these premises using modus tollens.\n\nSince the argument follows a valid logical form, it is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
