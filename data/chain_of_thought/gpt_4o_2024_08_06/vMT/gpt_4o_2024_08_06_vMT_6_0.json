            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and its contrapositive.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be symbolized as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Bob did not choose pasta.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" This can be symbolized as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis structure is a classic example of a valid argument form known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a rule of logical inference that states if you have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and you know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then you can conclude that \\( P \\) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nIn this argument:\n- From \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can validly infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it correctly applies the modus tollens rule of inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
