            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a premise that affirms the antecedent of that conditional statement. The structure is as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n2. Premise 2: The doll was plastic. (This affirms the antecedent: P)\n3. Conclusion: The truck was metal. (This is the consequent: Q)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus ponens,\" which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus ponens can be summarized as:\n\n- If P, then Q.\n- P is true.\n- Therefore, Q is true.\n\nIn this argument, the premises logically lead to the conclusion. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. The second premise confirms that the condition (the doll being plastic) is met. Therefore, it logically follows that the conclusion (the truck was metal) must also be true.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
