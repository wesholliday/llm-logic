            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a modus ponens inference. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be symbolized as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a straightforward statement: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This is equivalent to stating P is true.\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which is equivalent to stating Q is true.\n\nThe argument follows the modus ponens form, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus ponens can be summarized as follows:\n\n- If P, then Q.\n- P is true.\n- Therefore, Q is true.\n\nIn this argument:\n\n- The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between P and Q.\n- The second premise confirms that P is true.\n- The conclusion logically follows that Q must be true.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens structure, it is logically valid. The truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
