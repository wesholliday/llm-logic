            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a modus ponens argument. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be symbolized as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a simple statement: \"Tom watched football.\" This is equivalent to saying P is true.\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Jen watched basketball,\" which is equivalent to saying Q is true.\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n- Premise 1: If P, then Q.\n- Premise 2: P.\n- Conclusion: Q.\n\nThis is a classic example of modus ponens, a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus ponens states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and P is true, then Q must also be true. \n\nSince the argument follows this valid logical form, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
