            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement followed by an affirmation of the antecedent, leading to a conclusion. This is a classic example of a logical form known as \"modus ponens.\"\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q)\n2. Premise 2: The book was written by James. (This affirms the antecedent: P)\n3. Conclusion: The book is a mystery novel. (This concludes the consequent: Q)\n\nIn modus ponens, if the first premise (a conditional statement) is true, and the second premise (affirmation of the antecedent) is true, then the conclusion (the consequent) must also be true. This form of reasoning is considered valid in classical logic because it follows a rule that preserves truth: if both premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true.\n\nTherefore, given the premises, the conclusion logically follows. The argument is valid because it correctly applies the modus ponens rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
