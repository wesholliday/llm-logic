            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a direct assertion, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolically represented as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a direct assertion: \"Mary was at the wedding.\" This is simply P.\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This is Q.\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n- Premise 1: If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n- Premise 2: P\n- Conclusion: Q\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus ponens,\" which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus ponens states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and P is true, then Q must also be true. \n\nIn this case, since the premises \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Mary was at the wedding\" are both given as true, the conclusion \"Sue was at the wedding\" logically follows. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
