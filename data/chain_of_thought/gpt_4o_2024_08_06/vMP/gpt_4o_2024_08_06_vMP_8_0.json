            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a direct assertion, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be symbolized as \"V \u2192 M\", where \"V\" represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \"M\" represents \"the mummy was awake\".\n\n2. The second premise is a direct assertion: \"The vampire was awake.\" This can be symbolized as \"V\".\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The mummy was awake.\" This can be symbolized as \"M\".\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n- Premise 1: V \u2192 M\n- Premise 2: V\n- Conclusion: M\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus ponens\", which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus ponens states that if \"P \u2192 Q\" is true and \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true. In this case, \"P\" is \"V\" and \"Q\" is \"M\". Since both premises are true, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it correctly applies the rule of modus ponens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
