            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a modus ponens argument. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be symbolized as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second premise is a simple statement: \"The apple was red.\" This can be symbolized as \"P.\"\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The banana was yellow.\" This can be symbolized as \"Q.\"\n\nThe structure of the argument is as follows:\n- Premise 1: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n- Premise 2: P (P is true)\n- Conclusion: Q (Therefore, Q is true)\n\nThis structure is a classic example of modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus ponens states that if \"P \u2192 Q\" is true and \"P\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true. \n\nSince the argument follows this valid logical form, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
