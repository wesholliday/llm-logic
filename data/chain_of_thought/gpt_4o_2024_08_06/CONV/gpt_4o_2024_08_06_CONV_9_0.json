            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If Q, then P.\"\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If Q, then P.\" The latter is known as the converse of the original statement. The truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This does not mean that \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" because the ground could be wet for other reasons, such as someone watering the garden.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,\" we cannot logically infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
