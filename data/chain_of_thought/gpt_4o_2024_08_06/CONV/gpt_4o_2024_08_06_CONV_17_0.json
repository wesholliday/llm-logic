This new statement can be represented as \"If Q, then P\" (Q \u2192 P). \n\nIn logic, the original statement (P \u2192 Q) does not imply its converse (Q \u2192 P). The converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. \n\nFor example, the original statement could be true if both Ben and Kate ate their respective meals, or if Ben did not eat pasta at all (in which case the statement is vacuously true). However, the converse would require that every time Kate ate salad, Ben must have eaten pasta, which is not supported by the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta\" from the original statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\".\n\nAnswer: no",
