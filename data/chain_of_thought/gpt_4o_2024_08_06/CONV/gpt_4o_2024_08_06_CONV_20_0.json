The original statement does not necessarily imply its converse. In other words, just because \"If P, then Q\" is true, it does not mean that \"If Q, then P\" is also true.\n\nTo determine if the converse is true, we would need additional information. The truth of the original statement does not provide enough information to conclude the truth of the converse. Therefore, from the given statement alone, we cannot infer that \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
