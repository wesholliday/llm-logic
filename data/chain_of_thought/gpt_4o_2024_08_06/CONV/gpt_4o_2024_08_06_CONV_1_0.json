            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding,\" which is the converse of the original statement. The converse of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If Q, then P.\"\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. The original statement only tells us that whenever Mary is at the wedding, Sue is also there. It does not provide any information about what happens when Sue is at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mary is at the wedding whenever Sue is there based solely on the original statement.\n\nTo illustrate with an example, consider a scenario where Mary only attends weddings if Sue is there, but Sue might attend weddings without Mary. In this case, the original statement holds true, but the converse does not.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer the converse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
