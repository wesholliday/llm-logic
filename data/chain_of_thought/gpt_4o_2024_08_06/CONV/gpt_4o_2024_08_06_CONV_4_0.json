The converse of a conditional statement is a different statement and is not logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nTo infer \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars\" from the original statement would require the converse to be true, which is not guaranteed by the original statement alone. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer the converse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
