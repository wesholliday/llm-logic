            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether 'The book was written by James' is necessarily true, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The book is a mystery novel,\" which corresponds to Q being true.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply that Q being true means P must be true. The truth of Q does not necessarily confirm the truth of P. This is because there could be other reasons or authors that could make the book a mystery novel. The conditional statement only tells us that if P is true, then Q must be true, but not the reverse.\n\nTherefore, even though the book is a mystery novel, it does not necessarily follow that it was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels, and the book could have been written by one of them.\n\nAnswer: no",
