            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether 'The doll was plastic' is necessarily true, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"P \u2192 Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The truck was metal,\" which is equivalent to saying Q is true.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" does not imply that P is true just because Q is true. The truth of Q can occur independently of P. The conditional statement only tells us that if P is true, then Q must be true. However, Q being true does not provide any information about the truth value of P.\n\nFor example, consider the following analogy: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" If we know \"the ground is wet,\" it does not necessarily mean \"it is raining\" because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet, such as someone watering the garden.\n\nTherefore, knowing that \"The truck was metal\" (Q is true) does not allow us to conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" (P is true) because the truth of Q does not depend solely on P.\n\nAnswer: no",
