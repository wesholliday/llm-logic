            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is necessarily true, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"M \u2192 S,\" where M stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S stands for \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if M is true, then S must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding,\" which means S is true.\n\nWe need to determine if these statements necessarily imply that M is true.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" does not provide any information about the truth of M if S is true. The truth of S alone does not affect the truth of M. The conditional only tells us that if M were true, then S would be true, but it does not say anything about the situation where S is true independently of M.\n\nTherefore, even though S is true, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of M based solely on the given information. M could be true or false, and the truth of S does not help us determine which.\n\nAnswer: no",
