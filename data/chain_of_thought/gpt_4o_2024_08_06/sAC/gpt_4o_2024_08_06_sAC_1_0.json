            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If M, then S,\" where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding,\" which means S is true.\n\nNow, let's consider what we know:\n\n- The conditional statement \"If M, then S\" tells us that whenever M is true, S must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if S is true on its own. The truth of S does not necessarily imply the truth of M.\n\n- The fact that S is true (Sue was at the wedding) does not allow us to conclude anything about M (Mary was at the wedding) because the conditional statement only specifies what happens if M is true, not if S is true.\n\nIn logical terms, the truth of the consequent (S) does not imply the truth of the antecedent (M) in a conditional statement. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
