            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether the statement 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' can be inferred from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel' can be expressed in logical terms as 'If P, then not Q', where P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book is a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James', which can be expressed as 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe original statement 'If P, then not Q' has the contrapositive 'If Q, then not P'. Therefore, the statement 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James' is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and can be logically inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
