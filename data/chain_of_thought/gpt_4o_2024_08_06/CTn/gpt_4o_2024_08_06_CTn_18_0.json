            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether the statement 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic' can be inferred from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal' is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'P \u2192 \u00acM', where 'P' stands for 'the doll was plastic' and '\u00acM' stands for 'the truck was not metal'.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic', can be represented as 'M \u2192 \u00acP', where 'M' stands for 'the truck was metal' and '\u00acP' stands for 'the doll was not plastic'.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'P \u2192 Q' is '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement 'P \u2192 \u00acM' is 'M \u2192 \u00acP'. This is exactly the statement we are trying to infer: 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic'.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is always true, we can indeed infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
