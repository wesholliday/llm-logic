            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow' can be represented in logical terms as 'A \u2192 \u00acB', where 'A' is 'the apple was red' and '\u00acB' is 'the banana was not yellow'.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red', can be represented as 'B \u2192 \u00acA', where 'B' is 'the banana was yellow' and '\u00acA' is 'the apple was not red'.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement 'P \u2192 Q' is '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP', and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if we take the contrapositive of the original statement 'A \u2192 \u00acB', we get 'B \u2192 \u00acA', which is exactly the statement we want to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
