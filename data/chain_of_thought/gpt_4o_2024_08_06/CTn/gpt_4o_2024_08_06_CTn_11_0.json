This is a conditional statement.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate', can be represented as 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn logic, the statement 'If P, then not Q' is equivalent to its contrapositive, which is 'If Q, then not P'. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThus, from the statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry', we can indeed infer 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate', because the latter is the contrapositive of the former.\n\nAnswer: yes",
