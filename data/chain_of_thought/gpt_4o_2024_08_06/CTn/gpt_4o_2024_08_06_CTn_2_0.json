The original statement (G \u2192 \u00acU) is a conditional statement. The statement we want to infer (U \u2192 \u00acG) is the converse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. The converse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, from the statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest', we cannot logically infer 'If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: no",
