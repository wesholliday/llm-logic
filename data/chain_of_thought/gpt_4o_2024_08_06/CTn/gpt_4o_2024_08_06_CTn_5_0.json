            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer the statement 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from the given statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis', we need to analyze the logical structure of these statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis' can be represented in logical terms as 'If P, then not Q', where P is 'Jeff played basketball' and Q is 'Amy played tennis'. This is a conditional statement.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball', which can be represented as 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement 'If Q, then not P' is not the contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q'. Instead, it is the converse of the original statement. The converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis', we cannot logically infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' because the latter is the converse of the former, and the truth of a converse is not guaranteed by the truth of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
