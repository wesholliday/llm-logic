            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' from the statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den' can be represented in logical terms as 'B \u2192 \u00acW', where 'B' stands for 'the bear was in the cave' and '\u00acW' stands for 'the wolf was not in the den'.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave', can be represented as 'W \u2192 \u00acB', where 'W' stands for 'the wolf was in the den' and '\u00acB' stands for 'the bear was not in the cave'.\n\nIn logic, the original statement 'B \u2192 \u00acW' is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'P \u2192 Q' is '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP', and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the contrapositive of 'B \u2192 \u00acW' is 'W \u2192 \u00acB', which is exactly the statement we want to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' from 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
