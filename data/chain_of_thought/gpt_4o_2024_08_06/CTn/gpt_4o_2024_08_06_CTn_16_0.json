            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer the statement 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from the given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim', we need to analyze the logical structure of these statements.\n\nThe given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim' is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then not Q', where P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants were denim'.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton', which can be represented as 'If Q, then not P'.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nFor the given statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim' (If P, then not Q), the contrapositive would be 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton' (If Q, then not P).\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
