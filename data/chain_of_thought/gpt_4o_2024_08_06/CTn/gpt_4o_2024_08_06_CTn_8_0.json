            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake' from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake' can be represented in logical terms as: \n- V \u2192 \u00acM\nwhere V represents 'the vampire was awake' and M represents 'the mummy was awake'. The arrow (\u2192) represents logical implication, and \u00ac represents negation.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake', which can be represented as:\n- M \u2192 \u00acV\n\nThe original statement V \u2192 \u00acM is a conditional statement. The statement we want to infer, M \u2192 \u00acV, is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nTherefore, if the original statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake' is true, then its contrapositive 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
