The original statement \"A \u2192 \u00acC\" is a conditional statement, and its contrapositive is logically equivalent to it. The contrapositive of \"A \u2192 \u00acC\" is \"C \u2192 \u00acA\", which is exactly the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"C \u2192 \u00acA\" from \"A \u2192 \u00acC\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
