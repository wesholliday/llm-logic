            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\" \n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \"If Q, then not P.\"\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement \"If P, then not Q\" does not directly imply \"If Q, then not P.\" The latter is actually the contrapositive of the original statement, which would be \"If Q, then not P.\" However, the contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P,\" which is exactly what we are trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid because the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
