            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football' from the statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball' can be represented in logical terms as: \n- Let P be 'Tom watched football'.\n- Let Q be 'Jen did not watch basketball'.\n\nThe statement can be written as: If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q).\n\nThe statement we want to infer is 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football', which can be represented as:\n- Let R be 'Jen watched basketball'.\n- Let S be 'Tom did not watch football'.\n\nThis can be written as: If R, then S (R \u2192 S).\n\nTo determine if we can infer R \u2192 S from P \u2192 Q, we need to consider the logical relationship between these statements. The original statement P \u2192 Q is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which translates to 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football' (R \u2192 S).\n\nTherefore, the statement 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football' is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and is logically equivalent to it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
