            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then not Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which can be represented as \"If Q, then not P.\"\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical structure of the statements. The original statement is a conditional statement, and the inference being asked about is its contrapositive. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThus, from the statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" we can indeed infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
