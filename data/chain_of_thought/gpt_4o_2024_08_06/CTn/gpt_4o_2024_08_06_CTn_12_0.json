            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo' can be represented in logical terms as 'P \u2192 \u00acZ', where 'P' stands for 'Joe went to the park' and '\u00acZ' stands for 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park', can be represented as 'Z \u2192 \u00acP'.\n\nIn logic, the statement 'P \u2192 \u00acZ' is equivalent to its contrapositive 'Z \u2192 \u00acP'. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nSince 'Z \u2192 \u00acP' is the contrapositive of 'P \u2192 \u00acZ', we can indeed infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
