            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether the statement 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars' can be inferred from 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter' can be expressed in logical terms as: \n- Let A represent 'the alien visited Mars'.\n- Let R represent 'the robot visited Jupiter'.\n\nThe original statement can be written as: If A, then not R (A \u2192 \u00acR).\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars, which can be expressed as: If R, then not A (R \u2192 \u00acA).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If A, then not R' is 'If R, then not A'. Therefore, the statement 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars' is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and is logically equivalent to it.\n\nThus, we can infer 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars' from 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
