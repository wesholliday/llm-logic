            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue' can be represented in logical terms as 'P implies not Q', where P is 'the car was red' and Q is 'the truck was blue'. In logical terms, this is written as P \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red', which can be represented as 'Q implies not P', or Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if Q \u2192 \u00acP can be inferred from P \u2192 \u00acQ, we need to consider the rules of logical inference. The original statement P \u2192 \u00acQ is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is Q \u2192 \u00acP, which is exactly the statement we want to infer.\n\nTherefore, since the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
