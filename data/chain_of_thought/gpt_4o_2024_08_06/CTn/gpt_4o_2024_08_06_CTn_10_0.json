            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside' can be represented in logical terms as: \n- Let D represent 'the dog was inside'.\n- Let C represent 'the cat was outside'.\n\nThe statement can be written as: If D, then not C (D \u2192 \u00acC).\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside, which can be represented as: If C, then not D (C \u2192 \u00acD).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If D, then not C' is 'If C, then not D'. Therefore, the statement 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside' is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
