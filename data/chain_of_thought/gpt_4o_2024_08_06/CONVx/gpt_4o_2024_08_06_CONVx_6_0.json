The latter is known as the converse of the former, and the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. For example, 'If it is raining, then the ground is wet' does not imply 'If the ground is wet, then it is raining', as there could be other reasons for the ground being wet.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse 'If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was sploffed' from the original statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink'.\n\nAnswer: no",
