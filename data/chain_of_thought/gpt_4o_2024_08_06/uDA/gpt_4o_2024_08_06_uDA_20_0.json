            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe given information also states that \"the apple was not red,\" which means that P is false.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not provide any information about the truth value of Q when P is false. The only thing the conditional statement tells us is that if P were true, then Q would have to be true. However, if P is false, Q can be either true or false without affecting the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, from the information that the apple was not red, we cannot infer anything about the color of the banana. The banana could still be yellow or it could be some other color, and this would not contradict the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
