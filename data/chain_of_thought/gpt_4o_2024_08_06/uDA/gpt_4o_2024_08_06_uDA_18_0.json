            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given logical statement and determine what can be inferred from it.\n\nThe statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not provide any information about what happens if P is false. The only thing it tells us is that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. However, if P is false, Q can be either true or false, and the conditional statement would still hold true.\n\nThe problem also states, \"the doll was not plastic,\" which means P is false. Since the conditional statement does not specify what happens when P is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusion about the truth value of Q (whether the truck was metal or not).\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer that the truck was not metal. The truck could be metal or not metal, and both scenarios would be consistent with the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
