In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe information given also states \"the cake was not chocolate,\" which is the negation of P (not P).\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the negation of P (not P), we cannot directly infer the negation of Q (not Q). This is because the truth of Q is not dependent solely on P being true. There could be other reasons or conditions under which Q could still be true even if P is false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that the muffins were not blueberry just because the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
