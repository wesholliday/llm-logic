            "content": "Explanation: \nThe problem presents a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be symbolically represented as \"If L, then M,\" where L is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and M is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If L, then M\" does not provide information about what happens if L is false. The only thing it tells us is that whenever L is true, M must also be true. However, if L is false, the conditional statement does not specify whether M is true or false.\n\nThe problem also states that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which means L is false. Since the conditional statement does not provide information about the scenario where L is false, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of M based solely on the information given.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not, because the conditional statement does not cover the case where Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
