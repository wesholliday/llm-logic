            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If V (vampire is awake), then M (mummy is awake), or V \u2192 M.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The vampire was not awake.\" In logical terms, this is represented as:\n   - Not V, or \u00acV.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the mummy was not awake (\u00acM) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement (V \u2192 M) does not provide information about what happens if the first part (V) is false. The only thing we know from the conditional is that if V is true, then M must be true. However, if V is false (\u00acV), the conditional statement does not tell us anything about the truth value of M. M could be true or false independently of V being false.\n\nTherefore, from the information given (V \u2192 M and \u00acV), we cannot infer anything about the state of the mummy (M). The mummy could be awake or not awake, and the given statements do not provide enough information to conclude either way.\n\nAnswer: no",
