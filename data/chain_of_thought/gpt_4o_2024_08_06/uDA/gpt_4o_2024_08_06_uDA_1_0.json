            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If M, then S,\" where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this is represented as \"not M.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"not S\" (Sue was not at the wedding) from these statements.\n\nThe conditional statement \"If M, then S\" does not provide any information about what happens if M is false. It only tells us that whenever M is true, S must also be true. However, if M is false, the conditional statement does not specify whether S is true or false. \n\nIn logical terms, the truth of S is independent of the truth of M when M is false. Therefore, from \"not M,\" we cannot infer anything about the truth value of S. Sue could have been at the wedding or not, regardless of Mary's absence.\n\nThus, based on the information given, we cannot conclude that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
