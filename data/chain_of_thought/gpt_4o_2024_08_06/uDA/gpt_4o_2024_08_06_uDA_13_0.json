            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"the car was not red,\" which is the negation of P, or \"not P.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not provide any information about what happens if P is false. The only thing the conditional statement tells us is that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. However, if P is false, Q can be either true or false, and the conditional statement does not give us any information about Q in this case.\n\nTherefore, from the information given (\"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"the car was not red\"), we cannot infer anything about the color of the truck. The truck could be blue or not blue, and the given statements do not provide enough information to determine which is the case.\n\nAnswer: no",
