            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"the shirt was not cotton,\" which is the negation of P, or \"not P.\"\n\nIn logic, from the statement \"If P, then Q,\" and the fact \"not P,\" we cannot directly infer \"not Q.\" This is because the original conditional statement only tells us what happens if P is true; it does not provide information about what happens if P is false. The pants could still be denim for some other reason not related to the shirt being cotton.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot conclude that the pants were not denim. The logical fallacy that would occur if we made such an inference is known as \"denying the antecedent.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
