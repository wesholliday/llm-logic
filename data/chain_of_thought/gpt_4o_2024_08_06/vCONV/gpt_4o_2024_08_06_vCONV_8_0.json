            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n- \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\nwhere \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\" This can be represented as:\n- \\( M \\rightarrow V \\)\n\nFor an argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must be true whenever the premise is true. In other words, the truth of the premise should guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nLet's analyze the logical implications:\n1. The premise \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) means that whenever \\( V \\) is true, \\( M \\) must also be true.\n2. The conclusion \\( M \\rightarrow V \\) means that whenever \\( M \\) is true, \\( V \\) must also be true.\n\nTo check the validity, consider the possible truth values for \\( V \\) and \\( M \\):\n- If \\( V \\) is true and \\( M \\) is true, both the premise and conclusion are true.\n- If \\( V \\) is true and \\( M \\) is false, the premise is false, so the argument is vacuously valid (since a false premise cannot lead to a false conclusion).\n- If \\( V \\) is false and \\( M \\) is true, the premise is true (since a false antecedent makes the implication true), but the conclusion is false. This is a counterexample to the validity of the argument.\n- If \\( V \\) is false and \\( M \\) is false, both the premise and conclusion are true.\n\nThe counterexample occurs when \\( V \\) is false and \\( M \\) is true, showing that the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
