            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolized as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolized as \\( S \\rightarrow M \\).\n\nFor an argument to be logically valid, the truth of the premise must guarantee the truth of the conclusion. In other words, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true in every possible scenario.\n\nLet's examine the logical relationship between the premise \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and the conclusion \\( S \\rightarrow M \\):\n\n1. If \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is true, it means that whenever Mary is at the wedding, Sue must also be at the wedding. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Sue is at the wedding.\n\n2. The conclusion \\( S \\rightarrow M \\) asserts that whenever Sue is at the wedding, Mary must also be at the wedding. This is a different claim and is not directly supported by the premise.\n\n3. The argument assumes a biconditional relationship (i.e., \\( M \\leftrightarrow S \\)), which means \"Mary was at the wedding if and only if Sue was at the wedding.\" However, the premise only provides a one-way conditional relationship, not a biconditional one.\n\n4. To illustrate with a counterexample: Suppose Mary was not at the wedding, and Sue was at the wedding. The premise \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is still true because the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is false, making the entire conditional true regardless of whether Sue was at the wedding. However, the conclusion \\( S \\rightarrow M \\) would be false because Sue was at the wedding, but Mary was not.\n\nSince there is a scenario where the premise is true and the conclusion is false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
