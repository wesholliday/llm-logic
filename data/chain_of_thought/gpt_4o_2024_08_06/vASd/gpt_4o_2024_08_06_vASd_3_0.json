            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is: \"If the car is in the garage, then it is safe.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n- Let \\( P \\) be \"the car is in the garage.\"\n- Let \\( Q \\) be \"the car is safe.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe.\" This can be represented as:\n- Let \\( R \\) be \"the garage is flooding.\"\n\nThe conclusion can be written as: \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) states that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true. The conclusion \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) states that if both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n\nThe key point here is that the conclusion introduces an additional condition \\( R \\) (the garage is flooding) that is not present in the premise. The premise only guarantees that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) is true, regardless of any other conditions like \\( R \\).\n\nIn logical terms, if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) is also true because if \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must be true regardless of whether \\( R \\) is true or false. The presence of \\( R \\) does not affect the truth of \\( Q \\) as long as \\( P \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion does not contradict the premise and follows logically from it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
