            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise given is: \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Let S represent \"you get enough sleep.\"\n- Let T represent \"you won't be tired.\"\n\nThe premise can be written as: If S, then T (S \u2192 T).\n\nThe conclusion is: \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\" This can be represented as:\n- Let H represent \"you do hard labor.\"\n\nThe conclusion can be written as: If S and H, then T ((S \u2227 H) \u2192 T).\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The premise states that getting enough sleep (S) is sufficient for not being tired (T). However, the conclusion introduces an additional condition (H) that is not present in the premise.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the truth of the premise must guarantee the truth of the conclusion. In this case, the premise does not account for the additional condition of doing hard labor (H). The premise only assures that if you get enough sleep, you won't be tired, but it does not address what happens if you also do hard labor. Therefore, the conclusion that you won't be tired even if you do hard labor is not guaranteed by the premise alone.\n\nIn logical terms, the argument is invalid because the introduction of the additional condition (H) in the conclusion is not supported by the premise. The premise does not provide information about the effect of hard labor on being tired, so we cannot conclude that the same outcome (not being tired) will hold when hard labor is involved.\n\nAnswer: no",
