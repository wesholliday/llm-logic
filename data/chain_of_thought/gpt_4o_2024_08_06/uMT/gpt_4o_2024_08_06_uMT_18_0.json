Modus tollens states that if P \u2192 Q is true and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n\n1. We have the conditional statement: If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q).\n2. We know \u00acQ (the truck was not metal).\n\nFrom these, we can infer \u00acP (the doll was not plastic).\n\nTherefore, based on the information given and the logical reasoning applied, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
