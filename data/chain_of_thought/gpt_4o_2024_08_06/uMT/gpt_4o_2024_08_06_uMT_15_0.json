            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Erin did not take a train.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of Q:\n   - Not Q (\u00acQ).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Sam did not take a plane, which is the negation of P (\u00acP).\n\nIn logic, the rule of modus tollens allows us to infer the negation of the antecedent if we have a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent. The rule is structured as follows:\n- If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n- \u00acQ (Not Q)\n- Therefore, \u00acP (Not P)\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n- We have P \u2192 Q: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n- We have \u00acQ: \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nAccording to modus tollens, from these two premises, we can conclude \u00acP: \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the given information, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
