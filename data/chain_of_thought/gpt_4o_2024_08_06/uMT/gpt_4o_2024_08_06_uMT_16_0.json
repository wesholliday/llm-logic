            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given logical statement and the information provided.\n\nThe statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n\n- If P, then Q.\n\nWhere:\n- P = \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n- Q = \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nThe structure of this conditional statement is such that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, if Q is false, then P must also be false to maintain the truth of the statement.\n\nWe are also given the information that \"the pants were not denim.\" This means Q is false.\n\nIn logical terms, if Q is false, then P must also be false to satisfy the conditional statement \"If P, then Q.\" This is because the only scenario where a conditional statement is false is when the antecedent (P) is true and the consequent (Q) is false. Since Q is false, P cannot be true; otherwise, the original statement would be false.\n\nTherefore, based on the information that the pants were not denim (Q is false), we can infer that the shirt was not cotton (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
