            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this is:\n   - Not S (Sue was not at the wedding).\n\nNow, let's apply these statements to see if we can infer anything about Mary:\n\n- The conditional statement \"If M, then S\" tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also have been at the wedding. \n\n- However, we know from the second statement that Sue was not at the wedding (Not S).\n\n- In logic, if a conditional statement \"If M, then S\" is true, and the consequent (S) is false (Not S), then the antecedent (M) must also be false. This is because the only way for the conditional statement to hold true when the consequent is false is if the antecedent is also false. This is known as the contrapositive reasoning.\n\nTherefore, since Sue was not at the wedding, it logically follows that Mary could not have been at the wedding either. \n\nAnswer: yes",
