            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"the truck was not blue,\" which is the negation of Q, or \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" is true, we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"not P.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that allows us to conclude the negation of the antecedent (P) if the consequent (Q) is false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. If the car was red (P), then the truck was blue (Q).\n2. The truck was not blue (not Q).\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n3. The car was not red (not P).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical reasoning applied, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
