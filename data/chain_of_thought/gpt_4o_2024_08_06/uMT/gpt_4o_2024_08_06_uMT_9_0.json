            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine what can be logically inferred from them.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this is represented as:\n   - Not M (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, which is represented as:\n   - Not L (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If L, then M\" (L \u2192 M) is equivalent to saying \"If not M, then not L\" (\u00acM \u2192 \u00acL). This is known as the contrapositive, and it is always logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\nGiven:\n- L \u2192 M (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt)\n- \u00acM (Mark did not buy the blue shirt)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of the first statement, we have:\n- \u00acM \u2192 \u00acL (If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt)\n\nSince we know \u00acM is true (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), we can apply the contrapositive:\n- Therefore, \u00acL must be true (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nThus, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
