            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine what can be logically inferred from them.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n\n- If C (cake is chocolate), then M (muffins are blueberry).\n\nThis is written as: C \u2192 M\n\nThe second statement is: \"The muffins were not blueberry.\" In logical terms, this is:\n\n- Not M (\u00acM)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the cake was not chocolate (\u00acC) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (C \u2192 M) and we know that the consequent (M) is false (\u00acM), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer that the antecedent (C) must also be false. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as:\n\n- If C \u2192 M and \u00acM, then \u00acC.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n\n1. C \u2192 M (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry)\n2. \u00acM (The muffins were not blueberry)\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n\n3. \u00acC (The cake was not chocolate)\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the application of logical reasoning, we can conclude that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
