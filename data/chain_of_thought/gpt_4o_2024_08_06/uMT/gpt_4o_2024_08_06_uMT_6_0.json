            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If P (Sue chose pizza), then Q (Bob chose pasta).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Bob did not choose pasta.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of Q:\n   - Not Q (Bob did not choose pasta).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza, which is the negation of P (Not P).\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q) implies that if P is true, Q must also be true. However, if Q is false (as given in the second statement), then P cannot be true. This is because if P were true, Q would have to be true as well, which contradicts the given information that Q is false.\n\nTherefore, if Q is false (Bob did not choose pasta), then P must also be false (Sue did not choose pizza) to satisfy the conditional statement. This is a logical principle known as \"modus tollens,\" which states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nThus, based on the given information, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
