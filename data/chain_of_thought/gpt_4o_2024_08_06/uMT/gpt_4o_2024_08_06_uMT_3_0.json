            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine if we can logically infer the conclusion.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: If P (the book was written by James), then Q (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of Q, or \u00acQ.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acP (the book was not written by James) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the rule of modus tollens allows us to infer \u00acP from the statements \"If P, then Q\" and \u00acQ. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as follows:\n- If P implies Q (P \u2192 Q)\n- Not Q (\u00acQ)\n- Therefore, not P (\u00acP)\n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n- We have \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" (P \u2192 Q).\n- We also have \"The book is not a mystery novel\" (\u00acQ).\n\nFrom these, we can validly infer that \"The book was not written by James\" (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
