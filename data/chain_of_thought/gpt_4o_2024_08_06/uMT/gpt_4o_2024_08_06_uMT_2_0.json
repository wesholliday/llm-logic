            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If G (griffin in the forest), then U (unicorn in the forest).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" In logical terms, this is:\n   - Not U (unicorn not in the forest).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest, given these statements.\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \"If G, then U\" can be understood as:\n- If G is true, then U must be true.\n- If U is false, then G must be false (this is the contrapositive of the original statement).\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if we know \"If G, then U\" is true, then \"If not U, then not G\" is also true.\n\nSince we have \"Not U\" (the unicorn was not in the forest), we can apply the contrapositive:\n- If not U, then not G.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
