            "content": "Explanation: \nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"the banana was not yellow,\" which is the negation of Q, or \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" is true, we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"not P.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that allows us to conclude the negation of the antecedent if the consequent is false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. If the apple was red (P), then the banana was yellow (Q).\n2. The banana was not yellow (not Q).\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n3. The apple was not red (not P).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the application of logical reasoning, we can conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
