            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Amy did not play tennis.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of Q, which is \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can infer that P must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive reasoning, which states that \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nApplying this reasoning to our problem:\n1. We have \"If Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy played tennis (Q).\"\n2. We know \"Amy did not play tennis\" (not Q).\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we can infer:\n- If not Q (Amy did not play tennis), then not P (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
