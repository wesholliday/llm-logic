            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" which can be represented as \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can infer that P must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive reasoning, which states that \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nSince we know \"not Q\" (Lucy did not go to the zoo), we can use the contrapositive of the original statement to conclude \"not P\" (Joe did not go to the park).\n\nAnswer: yes",
