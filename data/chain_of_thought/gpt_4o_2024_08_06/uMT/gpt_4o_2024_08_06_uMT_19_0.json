            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of Q:\n   - Not Q (\u00acQ).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Tom did not watch football, which is the negation of P (\u00acP).\n\nIn logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if you have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and you know that the consequent is false (\u00acQ), then you can conclude that the antecedent must also be false (\u00acP).\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n- We have P \u2192 Q (\"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\").\n- We also have \u00acQ (\"Jen did not watch basketball\").\n\nAccording to modus tollens, from P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can infer \u00acP (\"Tom did not watch football\").\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical rule of modus tollens, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
