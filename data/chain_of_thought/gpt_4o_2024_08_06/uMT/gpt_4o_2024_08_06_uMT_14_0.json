            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"the wolf was not in the den,\" which is the negation of Q, or \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can infer that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens, a valid form of argument. \n\nTherefore, given the conditional \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" and the fact that \"the wolf was not in the den,\" we can conclude that \"the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
