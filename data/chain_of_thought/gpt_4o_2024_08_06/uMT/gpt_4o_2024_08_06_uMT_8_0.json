The statements provided are:\n\n1. \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n2. \"The mummy was not awake.\"\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as: \n\"If V (vampire is awake), then M (mummy is awake).\" This can be written as V \u2192 M.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the mummy was not awake, which can be represented as \u00acM.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement V \u2192 M and we know that \u00acM is true, we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer that \u00acV must also be true. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states: if V \u2192 M is true and \u00acM is true, then \u00acV must be true.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n- We have V \u2192 M (if the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake).\n- We also have \u00acM (the mummy was not awake).\n\nFrom these, we can conclude \u00acV (the vampire was not awake).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
