The first statement is 'Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked'. This is a logical disjunction, which can be represented as 'T or S', where 'T' stands for 'the whiffle is tinked' and 'S' stands for 'the whiffle is shanked'. In logic, a disjunction is true if at least one of the components is true.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The whiffle is not tinked'. This can be represented as 'not T'.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- The disjunction 'T or S' tells us that at least one of 'T' or 'S' must be true.\n- The statement 'not T' tells us that 'T' is false.\n\nGiven that 'T' is false, the only way for the disjunction 'T or S' to be true is if 'S' is true. This is because, in a disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole statement to remain true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements 'Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked' and 'The whiffle is not tinked', we can logically infer that 'The whiffle is shanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
