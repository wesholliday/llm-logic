The first statement is 'Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked'. This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the twonk is varnished, or the twonk is plinked, or both.\n\n2. The second statement is 'The twonk is not plinked'. This provides us with additional information that one of the conditions in the disjunction is false: the twonk is not plinked.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply the rules of logical disjunction. Since the disjunction 'Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked' requires at least one of the conditions to be true, and we know from the second statement that 'The twonk is not plinked', the only remaining possibility is that 'The twonk is varnished' must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can logically infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
