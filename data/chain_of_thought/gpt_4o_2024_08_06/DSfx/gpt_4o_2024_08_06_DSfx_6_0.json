            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided.\n\n1. The first statement is \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed.\" This is a logical disjunction, which can be represented as:\n   - P \u2228 S\n   where P stands for \"the grommet is plopped\" and S stands for \"the grommet is sploffed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The grommet is not plopped.\" This is a negation, which can be represented as:\n   - \u00acP\n\nNow, we have the following logical expressions:\n- P \u2228 S (Either P or S is true)\n- \u00acP (P is not true)\n\nIn logic, a disjunction (P \u2228 S) is true if at least one of the components (P or S) is true. Since we know \u00acP (P is false), the only way for the disjunction P \u2228 S to be true is if S is true. Therefore, given that P is false, S must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nThus, from the statements \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed\" and \"The grommet is not plopped,\" we can logically infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
