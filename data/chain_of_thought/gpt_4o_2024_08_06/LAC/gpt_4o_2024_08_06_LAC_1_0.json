            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can logically infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where \"M\" stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \"S\" stands for \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if the condition \"M\" is true, then \"S\" must also be true.\n\nThe second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \"S\" being true.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"Mary was at the wedding\" (M), we need to see if the truth of \"S\" (Sue was at the wedding) necessarily implies the truth of \"M\" (Mary was at the wedding) based on the given information.\n\nThe conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" only tells us what happens if \"M\" is true; it does not provide information about what happens if \"S\" is true. The truth of \"S\" alone does not allow us to conclude anything about \"M\" because the conditional does not state \"if and only if.\" In logical terms, \"S\" being true does not imply \"M\" is true; it only confirms that if \"M\" were true, \"S\" would be true, which is already given.\n\nTherefore, from the statements provided, we cannot logically infer that \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
