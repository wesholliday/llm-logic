            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - Let C represent \"the sneg was crampled.\"\n   - Let S represent \"the sneg must have sproted the frink.\"\n   - The statement can be written as: C \u2192 S (If C, then S).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of S:\n   - \u00acS (not S).\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \u00acC (the sneg was not crampled) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the rule of modus tollens allows us to infer the negation of the antecedent from a conditional statement and the negation of the consequent. The rule is structured as follows:\n- Given: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n- Given: \u00acQ (Not Q)\n- We can infer: \u00acP (Not P)\n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n- We have C \u2192 S (If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink).\n- We have \u00acS (It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, from C \u2192 S and \u00acS, we can infer \u00acC (The sneg was not crampled).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
