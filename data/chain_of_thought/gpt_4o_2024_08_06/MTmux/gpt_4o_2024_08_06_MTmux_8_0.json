            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If C (the sprocket was cranked), then D (the sprocket must have been daggled).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of D:\n   - Not D (the sprocket must not have been daggled).\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' (Not C) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If C, then D\" and we know that D is false (Not D), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer that C must also be false (Not C). This is because if C were true, D would have to be true due to the conditional relationship, but since D is false, C cannot be true.\n\nApplying this to our situation:\n- We have \"If C, then D\" (If the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled).\n- We also have Not D (the sprocket must not have been daggled).\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude Not C (the sprocket was not cranked).\n\nAnswer: yes",
