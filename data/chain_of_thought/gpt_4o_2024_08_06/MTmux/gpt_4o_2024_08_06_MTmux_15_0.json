            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statements and determine if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb must have been spened.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of Q:\n   - Not Q (\u00acQ).\n\nWe need to determine if these two statements allow us to infer the conclusion: \"The dreb was not vroombed,\" which is the negation of P (\u00acP).\n\nIn logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if you have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), you can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). This can be summarized as:\n- If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n- We have P \u2192 Q (\"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened\").\n- We also have \u00acQ (\"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened\").\n\nAccording to modus tollens, from these two premises, we can infer \u00acP (\"The dreb was not vroombed\").\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The dreb was not vroombed\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
