            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - Let P be \"the grommet was sploffed.\"\n   - Let Q be \"the grommet must have plopped the frink.\"\n   - The statement can be written as: If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\" This is a negation of Q, which can be written as: \u00acQ.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \u00acP (the grommet was not sploffed) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that Q is false (\u00acQ), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer that P must also be false (\u00acP). Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and is structured as follows:\n- If P \u2192 Q (if P then Q)\n- \u00acQ (not Q)\n- Therefore, \u00acP (not P)\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n- We have P \u2192 Q (If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink).\n- We also have \u00acQ (It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink).\n\nFrom these, we can infer \u00acP (The grommet was not sploffed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
