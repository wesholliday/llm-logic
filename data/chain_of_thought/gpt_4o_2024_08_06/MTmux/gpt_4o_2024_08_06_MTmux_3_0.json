            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The splat was not morphed' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If M (the splat was morphed), then Q (the splat must have quanked).\n   - Symbolically, this is: M \u2192 Q.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\" This is a negation of Q:\n   - Not Q.\n   - Symbolically, this is: \u00acQ.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \u00acM (the splat was not morphed) from M \u2192 Q and \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if you have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), you can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). \n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n- We have M \u2192 Q (if the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked).\n- We also have \u00acQ (it's not the case that the splat must have quanked).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, from M \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can infer \u00acM (the splat was not morphed).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
