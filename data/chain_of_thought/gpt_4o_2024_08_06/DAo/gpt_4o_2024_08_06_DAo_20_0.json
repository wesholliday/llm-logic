            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The apple was not red'. This is a straightforward statement about the color of the apple.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the apple was red' and Q is 'the banana was yellow'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' does not provide any information about the truth of Q if P is false. It only tells us that if P were true, then Q would also be true. \n\nGiven 'The apple was not red', we know that P is false. In classical logic, when the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement itself does not provide any information about the truth value of the consequent (Q). Therefore, from 'The apple was not red', we cannot infer anything about whether 'the banana was yellow' or 'the banana was not yellow'.\n\nThus, the information provided does not allow us to conclude 'The banana was not yellow'.\n\nAnswer: no",
