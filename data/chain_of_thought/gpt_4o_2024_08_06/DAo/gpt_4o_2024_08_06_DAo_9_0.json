            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'. This is a straightforward statement indicating that the event of Lisa buying the red shirt did not occur.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' does not provide any information about what happens if P is false. It only tells us that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. Therefore, if P is false, Q can be either true or false, and the conditional statement remains valid.\n\nGiven that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' (P is false), the conditional statement does not give us any information about whether Mark bought the blue shirt (Q). The truth of Q is independent of the truth of P when P is false.\n\nTherefore, from the information provided, we cannot infer whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not. The conditional statement does not allow us to conclude anything about Q when P is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
