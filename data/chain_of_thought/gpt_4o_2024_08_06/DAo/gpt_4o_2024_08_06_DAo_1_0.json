            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Mary was not at the wedding'. This is a straightforward statement indicating that Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If M, then S', where M represents 'Mary was at the wedding' and S represents 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If M, then S' is only false if M is true and S is false. In all other cases (M false, S true; M false, S false; M true, S true), the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the information we have:\n\n- We know that 'Mary was not at the wedding', which means M is false.\n\nGiven that M is false, the conditional statement 'If M, then S' does not provide any information about the truth value of S. The conditional statement is true regardless of whether S is true or false when M is false.\n\nTherefore, from the information that 'Mary was not at the wedding' and the conditional 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we cannot definitively conclude anything about whether Sue was at the wedding or not. The conditional statement does not imply anything about Sue's attendance when Mary is not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
