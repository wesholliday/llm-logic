            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The truck was not blue' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The car was not red'. This is a straightforward statement indicating the color of the car is not red.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the car was red' and Q is 'the truck was blue'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' does not provide any information about the truth of Q if P is false. It only tells us that if P were true, then Q would also be true. \n\nGiven 'The car was not red', we know that P is false. In classical logic, when the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement is false, the conditional statement itself does not provide any information about the truth value of the consequent (Q). Therefore, from 'The car was not red', we cannot infer anything about whether 'the truck was blue' or 'the truck was not blue'.\n\nThus, the information provided does not allow us to conclude 'The truck was not blue'.\n\nAnswer: no",
