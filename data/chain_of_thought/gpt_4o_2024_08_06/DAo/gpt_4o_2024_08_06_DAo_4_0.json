The first statement is 'The alien did not visit Mars'. Let's denote this as \u00acA, where A represents 'The alien visited Mars'.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'. This is a conditional statement and can be represented as A \u2192 R, where R represents 'The robot visited Jupiter'.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether 'The robot did not visit Jupiter', which is \u00acR.\n\nTo analyze this, we need to consider the logical implications of the given statements:\n\n- The statement A \u2192 R means that if A is true, then R must also be true. However, if A is false, the statement A \u2192 R does not provide any information about R. In other words, if the alien did not visit Mars (\u00acA), the conditional statement does not tell us anything about whether the robot visited Jupiter or not.\n\n- Since we know \u00acA (the alien did not visit Mars), the conditional statement A \u2192 R is vacuously true, but it does not allow us to conclude anything about R. The truth of R is independent of the truth of \u00acA in this context.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer \u00acR (the robot did not visit Jupiter) because the conditional statement does not provide information about R when A is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
