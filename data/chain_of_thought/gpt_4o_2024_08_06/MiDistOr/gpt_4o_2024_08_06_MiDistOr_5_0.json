            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" suggests that there are two possibilities for the delivery of the package: it could be delivered today, or it could be delivered tomorrow. The use of \"or\" in this context is inclusive, meaning that either one of the possibilities could occur, but not necessarily both at the same time.\n\nThe inference \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow\" essentially restates the original statement by explicitly mentioning both possibilities separately. It does not introduce any new information or change the meaning of the original statement. Both statements convey the same idea that there are two potential days for the delivery, and either one could be the actual delivery day.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid because it accurately reflects the meaning of the original statement without altering its intent or introducing any contradictions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
