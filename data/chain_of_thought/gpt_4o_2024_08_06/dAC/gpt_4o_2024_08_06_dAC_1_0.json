            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can deduce 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S stands for \"Sue was at the wedding\". This means that if M is true, then S must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"S\". This tells us that S is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can conclude \"Mary was at the wedding\" (M) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" and the fact that S is true, we cannot directly conclude that M is true. This is because the truth of S does not necessarily imply the truth of M. The conditional statement only tells us that if M were true, then S would be true, but it does not tell us what happens if S is true independently of M.\n\nFor example, it is possible that Sue was at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's presence. Therefore, the truth of S does not provide any information about the truth of M.\n\nThus, based on the given statements, we cannot deduce that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
