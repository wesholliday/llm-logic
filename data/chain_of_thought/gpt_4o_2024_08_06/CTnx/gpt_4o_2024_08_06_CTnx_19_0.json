The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other is also true.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement \"If V, then not P\" is \"If P, then not V.\" This is exactly the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and can be logically inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
