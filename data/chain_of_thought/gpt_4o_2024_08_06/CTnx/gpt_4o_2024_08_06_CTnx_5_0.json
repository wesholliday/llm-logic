The statement we want to infer (Q \u2192 \u00acP) is the converse of the original statement. In logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. The converse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled,\" we cannot logically infer the converse \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
