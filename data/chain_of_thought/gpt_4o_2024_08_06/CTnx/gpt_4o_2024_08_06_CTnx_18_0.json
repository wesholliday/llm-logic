            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked' from 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged' can be represented in logical terms as 'P implies not N', where P stands for 'the shank was plooked' and N stands for 'the shank was nugged'. In logical terms, this is written as P \u2192 \u00acN.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked', which can be represented as 'N implies not P', or N \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if N \u2192 \u00acP can be inferred from P \u2192 \u00acN, we need to consider the rules of logical inference. The original statement P \u2192 \u00acN is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acN is N \u2192 \u00acP, which is exactly the statement we want to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked' from 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
