The contrapositive of 'If F, then not B' (F \u2192 \u00acB) is 'If B, then not F' (B \u2192 \u00acF). \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped' from 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
