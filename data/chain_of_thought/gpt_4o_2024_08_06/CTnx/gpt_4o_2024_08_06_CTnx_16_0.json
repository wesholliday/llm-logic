The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' (P \u2192 Q) is 'If not Q, then not P' (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement 'If C, then not S' (C \u2192 \u00acS) is 'If S, then not C' (S \u2192 \u00acC). Therefore, the statement 'If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled' is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and can be logically inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
