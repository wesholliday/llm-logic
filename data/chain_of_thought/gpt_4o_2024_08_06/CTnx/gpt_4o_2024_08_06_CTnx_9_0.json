The original statement P \u2192 \u00acV is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acV is \u00acV \u2192 \u00acP, which means \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\"\n\nHowever, the statement we want to infer, V \u2192 \u00acP, is not the contrapositive of the original statement. Instead, it is the converse of the original statement. The converse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse (V \u2192 \u00acP) from the original statement (P \u2192 \u00acV).\n\nAnswer: no",
