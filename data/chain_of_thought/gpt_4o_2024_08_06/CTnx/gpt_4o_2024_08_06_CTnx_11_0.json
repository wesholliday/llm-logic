The original statement P \u2192 \u00acQ is a conditional statement, and its contrapositive is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement Q \u2192 \u00acP is not the contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ; it is the converse.\n\nIn logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse (Q \u2192 \u00acP) from the original statement (P \u2192 \u00acQ) without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
