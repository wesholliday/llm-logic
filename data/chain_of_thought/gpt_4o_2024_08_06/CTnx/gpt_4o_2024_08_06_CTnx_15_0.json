The original statement is a conditional statement, and the statement we want to infer is its contrapositive.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q) is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If V, then not S\" (V \u2192 \u00acS) is \"If S, then not V\" (S \u2192 \u00acV). Therefore, the statement \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and can be logically inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
