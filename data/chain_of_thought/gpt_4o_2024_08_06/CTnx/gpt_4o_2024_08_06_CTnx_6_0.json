The contrapositive of a statement 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is 'If Q, then not P' (Q \u2192 \u00acP). Therefore, the statement 'If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed' is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and can be inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
