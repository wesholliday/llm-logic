This is a conditional statement where 'Blimmed' is the antecedent and '\u00acZargled' (not zargled) is the consequent.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed', can be represented as 'Zargled \u2192 \u00acBlimmed'.\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'P \u2192 Q' is '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP', and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nThe contrapositive of 'Blimmed \u2192 \u00acZargled' is 'Zargled \u2192 \u00acBlimmed'. This is exactly the statement we are trying to infer. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
