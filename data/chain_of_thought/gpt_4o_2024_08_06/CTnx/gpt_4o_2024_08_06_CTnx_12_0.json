The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' is 'If Q, then not P'. Therefore, the statement 'If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped' is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint'.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the statement 'If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
