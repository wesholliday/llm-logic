The contrapositive of 'If P, then not Q' (P \u2192 \u00acQ) is 'If Q, then not P' (Q \u2192 \u00acP). Therefore, the contrapositive of the given statement is exactly the statement we want to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked' from 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
