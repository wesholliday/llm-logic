Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement \"If S, then \u00acC\" is \"If C, then \u00acS.\"\n\nSince the statement \"If C, then \u00acS\" is the contrapositive of the original statement \"If S, then \u00acC,\" it is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" from \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
