The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement \"If S, then not T\" is:\n- If T, then not S (T \u2192 \u00acS)\n\nThis is exactly the statement we are trying to infer. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
