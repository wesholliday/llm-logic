            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed' from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank' can be represented in logical terms as: \n- Let M represent 'the splat was morphed'.\n- Let Q represent 'the splat quank'.\n\nThe statement can be written as: \n- If M, then not Q (M \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed', which can be represented as:\n- If Q, then not M (Q \u2192 \u00acM).\n\nIn logic, the statement 'If M, then not Q' (M \u2192 \u00acQ) is equivalent to its contrapositive 'If Q, then not M' (Q \u2192 \u00acM). The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nThus, from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank', we can indeed infer 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
