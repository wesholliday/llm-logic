The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If B, then not S\" is \"If S, then not B.\" Since a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can indeed infer \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered\" from \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
