The statement we want to infer (D \u2192 \u00acC) is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled,\" we can indeed infer \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
