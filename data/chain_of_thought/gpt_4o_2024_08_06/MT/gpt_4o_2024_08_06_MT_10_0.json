            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n\n- Let D represent \"the dog was inside.\"\n- Let C represent \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nThe conditional statement can be written as: If D, then C (D \u2192 C).\n\nThe second statement is: \"The cat was not outside.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of C, which can be written as \u00acC.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The dog was inside\" (D) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement (D \u2192 C) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acC), we can apply a rule called \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that Q is false (\u00acQ), then we can conclude that P is false (\u00acP).\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. We have D \u2192 C (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside).\n2. We have \u00acC (The cat was not outside).\n\nFrom these, we can conclude \u00acD (The dog was not inside).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The dog was inside.\" In fact, we can infer the opposite: \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
