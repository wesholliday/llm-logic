            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The doll was not plastic' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n\n- If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n\nwhere P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe second statement is: \"The truck was not metal.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of Q:\n\n- Not Q (\u00acQ)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" (\u00acP) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if you have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), you can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP). This is because if the consequent is false, the antecedent must also be false for the conditional statement to hold true.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n\n1. If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n2. Not Q (\u00acQ)\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n\n3. Not P (\u00acP)\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
