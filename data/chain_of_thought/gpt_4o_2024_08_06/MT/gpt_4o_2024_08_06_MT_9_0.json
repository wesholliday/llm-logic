            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" which is the negation of Q, or \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" (Q is false), we can infer \"not P\" (P is false) through a rule called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that allows us to conclude the negation of the antecedent if the consequent is false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. If P (Lisa bought the red shirt), then Q (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n2. Not Q (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n3. Not P (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the logical rule of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
