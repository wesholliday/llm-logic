            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given and determine if the conclusion logically follows from them.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If M, then S,\" where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \"not S.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" which is \"not M,\" from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \"If M, then S\" implies that if M is true, then S must also be true. However, if S is false (as given by \"not S\"), then M cannot be true, because if M were true, S would have to be true as well, which contradicts \"not S.\"\n\nThis reasoning is based on the contrapositive of the conditional statement. The contrapositive of \"If M, then S\" is \"If not S, then not M.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nSince we have \"not S\" (Sue was not at the wedding), we can use the contrapositive to conclude \"not M\" (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
