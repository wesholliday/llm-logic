            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Jen did not watch basketball,\" which is the negation of Q, or \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" (Q is false), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"not P\" (P is false). Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as follows:\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n1. If Tom watched football (P), then Jen watched basketball (Q).\n2. Jen did not watch basketball (not Q).\n3. Therefore, Tom did not watch football (not P).\n\nThus, based on the given statements and the logical rule of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
