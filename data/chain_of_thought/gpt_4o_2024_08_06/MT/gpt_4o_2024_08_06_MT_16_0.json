            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The pants were not denim,\" which is the negation of Q (not Q).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (not Q), we can infer that P must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive reasoning, which states that \"If P, then Q\" is logically equivalent to \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nSince we have \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were not denim,\" we can apply contrapositive reasoning to conclude that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
