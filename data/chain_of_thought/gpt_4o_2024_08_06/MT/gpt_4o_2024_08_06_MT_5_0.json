            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Amy did not play tennis,\" which is the negation of Q, or \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" (Q is false), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"not P\" (P is false). Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as follows:\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n1. If Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy played tennis (Q).\n2. Amy did not play tennis (not Q).\n3. Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball (not P).\n\nThus, based on the given statements and the logical rule of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
