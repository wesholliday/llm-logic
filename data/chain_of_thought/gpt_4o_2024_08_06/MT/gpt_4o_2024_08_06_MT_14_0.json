            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"B \u2192 W,\" where B stands for \"the bear was in the cave\" and W stands for \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The wolf was not in the den,\" which can be represented as \"\u00acW\" (not W).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" (if P then Q) is equivalent to \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\" (if not Q then not P), which is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven the original statement \"B \u2192 W,\" the contrapositive would be \"\u00acW \u2192 \u00acB\" (if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave).\n\nWe are given \"\u00acW\" (the wolf was not in the den). According to the contrapositive \"\u00acW \u2192 \u00acB,\" if \u00acW is true, then \u00acB must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer \"\u00acB\" (the bear was not in the cave).\n\nAnswer: yes",
