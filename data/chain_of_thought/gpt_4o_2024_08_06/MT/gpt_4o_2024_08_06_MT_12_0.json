            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo,\" which can be represented as \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is equivalent to saying \"If not Q, then not P\" (this is known as the contrapositive). The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven the original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (If P, then Q), the contrapositive would be \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" (If not Q, then not P).\n\nSince we are given \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" (not Q), we can apply the contrapositive to infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" (not P).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the statements and the application of the contrapositive, we can indeed infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
