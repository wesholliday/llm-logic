            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - V \u2192 M\n   Where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The mummy was not awake.\" In logical terms, this is:\n   - \u00acM\n   Where \u00acM represents \"the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The vampire was not awake\" (\u00acV) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement (V \u2192 M) means that if the first part (V) is true, then the second part (M) must also be true. However, if the second part (M) is false, then the first part (V) must also be false for the conditional statement to hold true. This is known as the contrapositive, which states that:\n   - \u00acM \u2192 \u00acV\n\nSince we have \u00acM (the mummy was not awake), we can apply the contrapositive of the original conditional statement (V \u2192 M) to infer \u00acV (the vampire was not awake).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
