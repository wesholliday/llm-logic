            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If G (griffin in the forest), then U (unicorn in the forest), or symbolically, G \u2192 U.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" In logical terms, this is:\n   - Not U, or symbolically, \u00acU.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" from these statements. In logical terms, this is asking if we can conclude \u00acG.\n\nIn logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if you have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and you know that the consequent is false (\u00acQ), then you can conclude that the antecedent is also false (\u00acP). \n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n- We have G \u2192 U (if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest).\n- We also have \u00acU (the unicorn was not in the forest).\n\nAccording to modus tollens, from G \u2192 U and \u00acU, we can infer \u00acG (the griffin was not in the forest).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
