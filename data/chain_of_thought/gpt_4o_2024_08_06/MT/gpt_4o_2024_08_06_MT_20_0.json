            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The banana was not yellow,\" which is the negation of Q, or \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" (the negation of Q), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"not P\" (the negation of P). Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as follows:\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. If the apple was red (P), then the banana was yellow (Q).\n2. The banana was not yellow (not Q).\n3. Therefore, the apple was not red (not P).\n\nThus, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
