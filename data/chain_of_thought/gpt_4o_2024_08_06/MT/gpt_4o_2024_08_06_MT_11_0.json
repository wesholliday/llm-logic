            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The muffins were not blueberry,\" which is the negation of Q, or \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" is true, we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"not P.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that allows us to conclude the negation of the antecedent (P) if the consequent (Q) is false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. If P (the cake was chocolate), then Q (the muffins were blueberry).\n2. Not Q (the muffins were not blueberry).\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n3. Not P (the cake was not chocolate).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical rule of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
