            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\" \n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is equivalent to saying \"If not Q, then not P\" (this is known as the contrapositive). The contrapositive of the given statement is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nWe are also given the statement \"The truck was not blue.\" This matches the condition in the contrapositive statement. Therefore, based on the contrapositive, we can infer that \"The car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
