            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Alex did not finish the race' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If A, then C,\" where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Chris did not finish the race,\" which can be represented as \"not C.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If A, then C\" is equivalent to saying \"If not C, then not A\" (this is known as the contrapositive). The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven the original statement \"If A, then C,\" and the fact \"not C\" (Chris did not finish the race), we can apply the contrapositive to infer \"not A\" (Alex did not finish the race).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
