            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" In logical terms, this is the negation of Q, or \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, there is a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true, and \"not Q\" is true, then \"not P\" must also be true. This means that if the consequence (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. \"If P, then Q\" is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n2. \"not Q\" is \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nFrom these, we can infer \"not P,\" which is \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the logical rule of modus tollens, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
