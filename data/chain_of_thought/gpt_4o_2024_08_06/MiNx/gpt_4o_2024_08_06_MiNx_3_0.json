            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' from 'The splat might not have been morphed', we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements.\n\nThe statement 'The splat might not have been morphed' suggests that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed. This means that it is not certain whether the splat was morphed or not; it leaves open the possibility that the splat was indeed morphed, but it is not a necessity.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' means that it is not necessary for the splat to have been morphed. This aligns with the idea that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed, as it indicates that morphing is not a required condition.\n\nIn logical terms, 'might not' implies that there is no necessity, which aligns with 'not must'. Therefore, from 'The splat might not have been morphed', we can indeed infer 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed', because the former suggests that morphing is not a necessity.\n\nAnswer: yes",
