            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"The sprocket might not have been daggled.\" This implies that it is possible that the sprocket was not daggled. It does not definitively state that the sprocket was not daggled, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nTo infer 'The sprocket was not cranked,' we need to use the contrapositive of the conditional statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nApplying this to our conditional statement, the contrapositive is: \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the information we have:\n\n- We know that it is possible that the sprocket was not daggled (\"The sprocket might not have been daggled\"). This means that the scenario where the sprocket was not daggled is a valid possibility.\n\n- According to the contrapositive, if the sprocket was not daggled, then it must be the case that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nSince the possibility of the sprocket not being daggled is consistent with the contrapositive, we can conclude that in the scenario where the sprocket was not daggled, the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
