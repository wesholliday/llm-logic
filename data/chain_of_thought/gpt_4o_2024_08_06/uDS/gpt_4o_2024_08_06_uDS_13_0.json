            "content": "Explanation: The problem presents a logical statement involving two possibilities for the location of a toy: it is either in the toy box or on the shelf. This is an example of a disjunction in logic, which is an \"either/or\" statement. The statement can be represented as:\n\n1. The toy is in the toy box OR the toy is on the shelf.\n\nAdditionally, we are given another piece of information:\n\n2. The toy is NOT on the shelf.\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (A OR B) and we know that one of the possibilities (B) is false, then the other possibility (A) must be true. This is known as the law of disjunctive syllogism.\n\nApplying this to the given statements:\n\n- We have the disjunction: \"The toy is in the toy box OR the toy is on the shelf.\"\n- We know: \"The toy is NOT on the shelf.\"\n\nSince the toy is not on the shelf, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the toy is in the toy box. Therefore, we can logically infer that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
