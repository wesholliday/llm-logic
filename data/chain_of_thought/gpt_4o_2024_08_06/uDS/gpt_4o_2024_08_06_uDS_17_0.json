            "content": "Explanation: We are given a logical statement with two parts: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\" This is an \"either/or\" statement, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. \n\nThe second part of the information provided is \"the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\" This directly negates one of the two possibilities in the \"either/or\" statement. \n\nSince the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, the only remaining possibility from the \"either/or\" statement is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack. \n\nIn logical terms, if we have a statement \"A or B\" and we know \"not B,\" then \"A\" must be true. Here, \"A\" is \"the scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" and \"B\" is \"the scarf is draped on the coat rack.\" Since \"not B\" is true, \"A\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
