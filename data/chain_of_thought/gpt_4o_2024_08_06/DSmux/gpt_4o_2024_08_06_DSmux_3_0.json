            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The splat is morphed' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - M \u2228 Q\n   where M stands for \"the splat is morphed\" and Q stands for \"the splat must be quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \u00acQ\n   where \u00acQ means \"it is not the case that the splat must be quanked.\"\n\nNow, let's use these logical representations to see if we can infer M (the splat is morphed).\n\nThe first statement (M \u2228 Q) is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of M or Q must be true. The second statement (\u00acQ) tells us that Q is false. \n\nGiven that Q is false, the disjunction M \u2228 Q can only be true if M is true, because for a disjunction to be true, at least one of its components must be true. Since Q is false, M must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" and \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked,\" we can logically infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
