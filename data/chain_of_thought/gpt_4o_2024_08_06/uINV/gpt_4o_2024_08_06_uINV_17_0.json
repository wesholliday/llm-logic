            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\" The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the truth of the inverse from the truth of the original statement.\n\nIn summary, from the statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad,\" we cannot logically conclude that \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
