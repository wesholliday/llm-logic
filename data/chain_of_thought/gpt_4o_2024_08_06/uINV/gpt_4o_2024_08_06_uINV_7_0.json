            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If A, then C,\" where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race\" from the original statement. This new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, which would be \"If not C, then not A.\" However, the statement given in the question is \"If not A, then not C,\" which is the inverse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true. However, the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The truth of the inverse cannot be determined solely from the truth of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" we cannot infer the inverse \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
