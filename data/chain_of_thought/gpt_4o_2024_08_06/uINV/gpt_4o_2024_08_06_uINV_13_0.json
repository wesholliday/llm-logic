            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. In logic, this is often represented as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue,\" we need to consider the logical structure of the original statement. The statement \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" is the inverse of the original statement. In logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\nThe original statement (P \u2192 Q) does not provide information about what happens if P is false. It only tells us that whenever P is true, Q is also true. The truth of Q when P is false is not addressed by the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) from the original statement.\n\nIn logical terms, the only valid inference from \"If P, then Q\" is its contrapositive, which is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, but the inverse is not.\n\nAnswer: no",
