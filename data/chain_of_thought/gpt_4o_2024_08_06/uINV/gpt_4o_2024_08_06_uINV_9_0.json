            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. In logic, this is often represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe logical structure of this statement is such that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, if P is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusion about Q based solely on this statement. This is because the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if Lisa does not buy the red shirt.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is not the contrapositive; it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse, \"If not P, then not Q,\" is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
