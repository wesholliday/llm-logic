            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe logical structure of this statement is such that it only provides information about what happens when the shirt is cotton. It does not provide any information about what happens when the shirt is not cotton. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the pants being denim or not when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nThe statement \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" is the inverse of the original statement. In logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not imply the truth of its inverse. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTo further clarify, the only logically equivalent statement to \"If P, then Q\" is its contrapositive, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive of the given statement would be \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" This is the only inference that can be made with certainty from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
