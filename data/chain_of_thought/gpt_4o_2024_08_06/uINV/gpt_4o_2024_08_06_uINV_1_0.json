            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe logical structure of this statement is such that if the first part (P) is true, then the second part (Q) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the first part (P) is false. In other words, the statement does not tell us what happens if Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is not the contrapositive of the original statement. Instead, it is the inverse, which is \"If not P, then not Q.\" The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nIn summary, the original statement does not provide enough information to conclude that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
