            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThe logical structure of this statement is such that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, if P is false, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about Q based solely on this statement. This is because the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the vampire is not awake.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake,\" we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\" This is a valid inference from the original statement. However, the statement \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" is not the contrapositive and is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake, based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
