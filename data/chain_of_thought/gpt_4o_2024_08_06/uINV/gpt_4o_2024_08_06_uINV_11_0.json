            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is known as the inverse of the original statement. In logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. The inverse is a separate statement and does not logically follow from the original conditional statement.\n\nTo clarify, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n1. The cake is chocolate (P is true), and the muffins are blueberry (Q is true). This satisfies the original statement.\n2. The cake is chocolate (P is true), and the muffins are not blueberry (Q is false). This would make the original statement false.\n3. The cake is not chocolate (P is false), and the muffins are blueberry (Q is true). The original statement does not specify what happens in this case, so it could still be true.\n4. The cake is not chocolate (P is false), and the muffins are not blueberry (Q is false). Again, the original statement does not specify what happens in this case, so it could still be true.\n\nFrom these scenarios, we can see that the original statement only tells us what happens when the cake is chocolate. It does not provide information about what happens when the cake is not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
