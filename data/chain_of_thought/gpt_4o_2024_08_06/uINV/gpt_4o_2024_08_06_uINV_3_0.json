            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is the contrapositive of the original statement. However, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is actually \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe statement \"If not P, then not Q\" is known as the inverse of the original statement. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nIn simpler terms, just because James writes only mystery novels, it does not mean that all mystery novels are written by James. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no",
