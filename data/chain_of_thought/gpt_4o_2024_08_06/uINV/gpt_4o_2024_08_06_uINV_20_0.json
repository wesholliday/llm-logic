In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is the contrapositive of the original statement. However, this is actually a misunderstanding of logical inference. The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nWhat the question is asking is actually the inverse of the original statement: \"If not P, then not Q.\" The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Just because the original statement is true, it does not mean that the inverse is true.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This does not mean that if it is not raining, the ground is not wet. The ground could be wet for other reasons, such as someone watering the garden.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" we cannot infer that \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
