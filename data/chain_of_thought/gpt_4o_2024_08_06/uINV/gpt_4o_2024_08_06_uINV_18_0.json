            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If not P, then not Q,\" which is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the question is asking about the inverse of the original statement, which is \"If not P, then not Q.\" The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal, based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
