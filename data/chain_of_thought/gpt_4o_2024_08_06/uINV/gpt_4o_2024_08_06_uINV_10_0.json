In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\" This is another conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to understand the logical relationship between the original statement and the new statement. The original statement is a conditional statement, and the new statement is its inverse.\n\nIn logic, the inverse of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\" However, the truth of the inverse is not guaranteed by the truth of the original statement. The only logically equivalent statement to \"If P, then Q\" is its contrapositive, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\" The truth of the inverse is independent of the truth of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
