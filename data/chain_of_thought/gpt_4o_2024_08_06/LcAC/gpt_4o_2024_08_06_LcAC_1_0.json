            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can logically conclude 'Mary was at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S stands for \"Sue was at the wedding\". This means that if M is true, then S must also be true.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"S\". This tells us that S is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if these statements allow us to conclude \"Mary was at the wedding\" (M).\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" and the fact that S is true, we cannot conclude that M is true. This is because the truth of S does not necessarily depend on M being true; S could be true for other reasons as well. The only conclusion we can draw from \"M \u2192 S\" and \"S\" is that the condition (M) might be true, but it is not guaranteed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
