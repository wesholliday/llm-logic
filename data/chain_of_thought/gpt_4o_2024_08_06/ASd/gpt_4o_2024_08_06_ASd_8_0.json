            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer the statement 'If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today' from the statement 'If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today', we need to analyze the logical structure of both statements.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today.\" This can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the package has shipped\" and Q is \"it will arrive today.\"\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is: \"If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today.\" This can be represented as \"If P and R, then Q,\" where R is \"the package was misrouted.\"\n\nFor the inference to be valid, the truth of the original statement must guarantee the truth of the inferred statement. However, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if the package was misrouted. The condition \"the package was misrouted\" (R) introduces a new factor that is not addressed in the original statement.\n\nIn logical terms, the original statement only guarantees Q (arrival today) if P (shipped) is true. It does not account for any additional conditions like R (misrouted). Therefore, we cannot infer that the package will still arrive today if it was misrouted, as the misrouting could potentially delay the arrival.\n\nThus, the inference is not valid because the original statement does not cover scenarios where the package was misrouted.\n\nAnswer: no",
