However, it does not provide any information about other conditions that might affect whether we have a good time.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer adds an additional condition: \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.\" This is a more complex conditional statement: \"If P and R, then Q,\" where R is \"a bomb goes off.\"\n\nThe original statement does not address the scenario where a bomb goes off. It only states that going to the concert is sufficient for having a good time, assuming no other factors are involved. The introduction of a bomb going off is a significant additional factor that could potentially affect whether we have a good time. The original statement does not guarantee that we will have a good time if a bomb goes off at the concert.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first because the original statement does not account for the additional condition of a bomb going off, which could drastically change the outcome.\n\nAnswer: no",
