            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" suggests a direct causal relationship between getting enough sleep and not being tired. It implies that sleep is the sole factor being considered in determining whether or not a person will be tired. \n\nHowever, the inference \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" introduces an additional factor: doing hard labor. Hard labor is a physically demanding activity that can cause fatigue regardless of the amount of sleep one gets. The original statement does not account for other factors that might influence tiredness, such as physical exertion, stress, or health conditions.\n\nTherefore, the introduction of hard labor changes the conditions under which the conclusion \"you won't be tired\" is drawn. The original statement does not provide information about how hard labor might affect tiredness, so we cannot infer that getting enough sleep will prevent tiredness if hard labor is also involved. \n\nIn logical terms, the original statement is a simple conditional (if-then) statement, while the inference attempts to apply the same conclusion under a more complex condition that includes an additional variable. Without evidence or information that sleep alone can counteract the fatigue caused by hard labor, the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
