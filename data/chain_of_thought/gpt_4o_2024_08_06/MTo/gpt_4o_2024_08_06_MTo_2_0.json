            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The griffin was not in the forest' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The unicorn was not in the forest.' This is a straightforward statement indicating the absence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.' In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If G, then U,' where G represents 'the griffin was in the forest' and U represents 'the unicorn was in the forest.'\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If G, then U' is only false if G is true and U is false. In all other cases (G false, U true, or both G and U false), the conditional statement is true.\n\nGiven the first statement 'The unicorn was not in the forest,' we know that U is false. For the conditional statement 'If G, then U' to hold true, G must also be false because if G were true, then U would have to be true to satisfy the conditional, which contradicts the fact that U is false.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the conditional statement to remain true, given that U is false, is for G to be false. This means 'The griffin was not in the forest.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
