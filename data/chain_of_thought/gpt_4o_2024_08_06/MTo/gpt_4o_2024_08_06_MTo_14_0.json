            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The bear was not in the cave' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The wolf was not in the den'. This is a straightforward statement indicating the absence of the wolf in the den.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If B, then W', where B represents 'the bear was in the cave' and W represents 'the wolf was in the den'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If B, then W' is equivalent to saying 'If B is true, then W must also be true'. The only situation where this conditional statement is false is when B is true and W is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n- We know from the first statement that 'The wolf was not in the den', which means W is false.\n\n- Given the conditional statement 'If B, then W', if W is false, then B cannot be true. This is because if B were true, W would have to be true to satisfy the conditional statement, but we know W is false.\n\nTherefore, the only way the conditional statement can hold true given that W is false is if B is also false. This means 'The bear was not in the cave'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
