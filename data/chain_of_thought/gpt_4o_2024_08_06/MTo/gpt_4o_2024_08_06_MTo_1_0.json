            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Sue was not at the wedding'. This is a straightforward statement indicating that Sue did not attend the wedding.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is only false if P is true and Q is false. In all other cases, the statement is considered true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n- We know from the first statement that Sue was not at the wedding (Q is false).\n- According to the conditional statement, if Mary was at the wedding (P is true), then Sue must be at the wedding (Q is true). However, we know that Q is false (Sue was not at the wedding).\n\nSince the conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' would be false if Mary was at the wedding (because it would lead to a true P and a false Q), the only way for the conditional statement to remain true is if Mary was not at the wedding (P is false).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
