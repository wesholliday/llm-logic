            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The book was not written by James' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This is a straightforward statement about the book's genre.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If P (the book was written by James), then Q (the book is a mystery novel).\n\nWe are given that the book is not a mystery novel (not Q). From the conditional statement, if Q is false, then P must also be false to satisfy the condition. This is because if P were true, Q would have to be true as well, according to the conditional statement. Since Q is false, P cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, from the conditional statement and the fact that the book is not a mystery novel, we can logically infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
