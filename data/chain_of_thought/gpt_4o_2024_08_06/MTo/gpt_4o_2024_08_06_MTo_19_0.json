            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Jen did not watch basketball'. This is a straightforward statement about Jen's actions.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. In logical terms, this can be expressed as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Tom watched football' and Q is 'Jen watched basketball'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is only false if P is true and Q is false. In all other cases, the statement is considered true. \n\nNow, let's examine the situation:\n\n- We know from the first statement that Q ('Jen watched basketball') is false because 'Jen did not watch basketball'.\n\n- For the conditional statement 'If P, then Q' to be true, and given that Q is false, P ('Tom watched football') must also be false. This is because if P were true, then Q would have to be true for the conditional statement to hold, which contradicts the fact that Q is false.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the conditional statement to remain true, given that Q is false, is for P to be false. This means 'Tom did not watch football'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
