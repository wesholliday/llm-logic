            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The car was not red' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The truck was not blue'. This is a straightforward statement indicating the color of the truck is not blue.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the car was red' and Q is 'the truck was blue'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is only false if P is true and Q is false. In all other cases (P false, Q true, or both P and Q true), the conditional statement is considered true.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation:\n\n- We know from the first statement that the truck was not blue (Q is false).\n- For the conditional statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' to hold true, given that Q is false, P must also be false. This is because if P were true (the car was red), then Q would have to be true (the truck was blue) for the conditional to be true, which contradicts our information that the truck was not blue.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the conditional statement to remain true, given that the truck was not blue, is if the car was not red (P is false).\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can logically infer that 'The car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
