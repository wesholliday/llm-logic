            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'. This is a straightforward statement about Mark's actions.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is equivalent to saying 'If not Q, then not P' (this is known as the contrapositive). The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\nGiven the conditional 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', the contrapositive would be 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nNow, we have the statement 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'. According to the contrapositive of the conditional statement, this implies 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
