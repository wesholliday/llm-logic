            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The vampire was not awake' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The mummy was not awake'. This is a straightforward statement indicating the state of the mummy.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If V, then M', where V represents 'the vampire was awake' and M represents 'the mummy was awake'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If V, then M' (V \u2192 M) is false only when V is true and M is false. In all other cases, the conditional statement is true.\n\nNow, let's consider the information we have:\n\n- We know 'The mummy was not awake', which means M is false.\n\nGiven the conditional statement 'If V, then M', and knowing that M is false, the only way for the conditional statement to remain true is if V is also false. This is because if V were true, then M would have to be true for the conditional statement to hold, which contradicts our information that M is false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that 'The vampire was not awake' (V is false) to ensure the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
