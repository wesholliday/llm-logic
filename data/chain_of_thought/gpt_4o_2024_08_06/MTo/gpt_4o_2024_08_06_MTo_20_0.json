            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The banana was not yellow.' This is a straightforward statement about the color of the banana.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.' In logical terms, this can be expressed as 'If P, then Q,' where P is 'the apple was red' and Q is 'the banana was yellow.'\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is equivalent to saying 'If P is true, then Q must also be true.' However, if Q is false, then P must also be false for the conditional statement to hold true. This is known as the contrapositive, which states 'If not Q, then not P.'\n\nNow, let's apply this to our statements:\n\n- We know from the first statement that 'The banana was not yellow,' which means Q is false.\n- According to the contrapositive of the second statement, if Q is false ('the banana was not yellow'), then P must also be false ('the apple was not red').\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that 'The apple was not red.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
