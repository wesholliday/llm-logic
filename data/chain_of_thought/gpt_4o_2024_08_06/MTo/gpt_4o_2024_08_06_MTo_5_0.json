            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Amy did not play tennis'. This is a straightforward statement about Amy's actions.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Jeff played basketball' and Q is 'Amy played tennis'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is only false if P is true and Q is false. In all other cases, the statement is considered true.\n\nNow, let's examine the situation:\n\n- We know from the first statement that 'Amy did not play tennis', which means Q is false.\n- For the conditional statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' to hold true, if Jeff did play basketball (P is true), then Amy must have played tennis (Q must be true). However, we know Q is false ('Amy did not play tennis'), which would make the conditional statement false if P were true.\n\nTherefore, for the conditional statement to remain true given that Q is false, P must also be false. This means 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can logically infer that 'Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
