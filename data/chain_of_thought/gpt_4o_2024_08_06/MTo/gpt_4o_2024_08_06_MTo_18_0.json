            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The doll was not plastic' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The truck was not metal'. This is a straightforward statement indicating the material of the truck.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck was metal'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is equivalent to 'If not Q, then not P' (this is known as the contrapositive). Therefore, the contrapositive of the second statement is 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'.\n\nNow, let's apply the information we have:\n\n- We know from the first statement that 'The truck was not metal'. \n- From the contrapositive of the second statement, 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic', we can directly infer that 'The doll was not plastic'.\n\nThus, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
