            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The pants were not denim.' This is a straightforward statement about the pants.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.' In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If P (the shirt was cotton), then Q (the pants were denim).\n\nWe are given that the pants were not denim, which means Q is false. In a conditional statement, if the consequent (Q) is false, then for the statement to be true, the antecedent (P) must also be false. This is because the only time a conditional statement is false is when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.\n\nTherefore, since the pants were not denim (Q is false), the conditional statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' can only hold true if the shirt was not cotton (P is false).\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can logically infer that 'The shirt was not cotton.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
