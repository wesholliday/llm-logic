            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The alien did not visit Mars' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The robot did not visit Jupiter.' This is a straightforward statement indicating that the robot's visit to Jupiter did not occur.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.' In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If A, then B,' where A is 'the alien visited Mars' and B is 'the robot visited Jupiter.'\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is equivalent to saying 'If not B, then not A' (this is known as the contrapositive). The contrapositive of the given conditional statement is: 'If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.'\n\nWe know from the first statement that 'The robot did not visit Jupiter.' According to the contrapositive of the second statement, if the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that 'The alien did not visit Mars.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
