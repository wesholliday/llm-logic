            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"The muffins were not blueberry.\" This is a straightforward statement indicating the type of muffins.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as: If P (the cake was chocolate), then Q (the muffins were blueberry).\n\nWe are given that Q (the muffins were blueberry) is false because the muffins were not blueberry. In logic, if a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, and Q is false, then P must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive reasoning, which states that if Q is false, then P must be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, since the muffins were not blueberry (Q is false), and the conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is assumed to be true, it follows that the cake was not chocolate (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
