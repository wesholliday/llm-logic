            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (This is a conditional statement: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\))\n2. Premise 2: Mark bought the blue shirt. (This is the statement \\( Q \\))\n3. Conclusion: Lisa bought the red shirt. (This is the statement \\( P \\))\n\nThe argument can be represented in logical terms as:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"affirming the consequent.\" In logic, affirming the consequent is a formal fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Just because the consequent \\( Q \\) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent \\( P \\) must also be true.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a similar structure:\n- If it is raining, then the ground is wet. (If \\( P \\), then \\( Q \\))\n- The ground is wet. (\\( Q \\))\n- Therefore, it is raining. (\\( P \\))\n\nIn this example, the ground could be wet for reasons other than rain, such as someone watering the garden. Thus, the conclusion is not necessarily true even if the premises are true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
