            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is composed of two premises and a conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. (This is a conditional statement: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".)\n2. Premise 2: Lucy went to the zoo. (This is \\( Q \\).)\n3. Conclusion: Joe went to the park. (This is \\( P \\).)\n\nThe form of this argument is:\n\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( Q \\)\n- Therefore, \\( P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"affirming the consequent.\" In logic, affirming the consequent is a formal fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Just because the consequent (\\( Q \\)) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (\\( P \\)) is true. There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\).\n\nFor example, Lucy could have gone to the zoo for reasons unrelated to Joe going to the park. The conditional statement only tells us that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, not that Lucy going to the zoo implies Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
