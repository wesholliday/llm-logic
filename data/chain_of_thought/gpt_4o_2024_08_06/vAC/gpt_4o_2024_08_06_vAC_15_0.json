            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is composed of two premises and a conclusion:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. (Symbolically, this can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\))\n2. Premise 2: Erin took a train. (Symbolically, this is: \\( Q \\))\n3. Conclusion: Sam took a plane. (Symbolically, this is: \\( P \\))\n\nThe form of this argument can be compared to known valid and invalid argument forms in logic. The structure of the argument is:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a common logical fallacy. In a valid argument, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. However, in this case, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nTo see why, consider the meaning of the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). It states that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, it does not state that \\( Q \\) being true implies \\( P \\) is true. There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\) being true.\n\nFor example, Erin could have taken a train for reasons unrelated to Sam taking a plane. The truth of \\( Q \\) (Erin took a train) does not guarantee the truth of \\( P \\) (Sam took a plane). Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, making the argument invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
