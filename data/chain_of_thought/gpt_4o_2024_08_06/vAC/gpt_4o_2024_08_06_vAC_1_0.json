            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure. The argument is presented in the form of a conditional statement and a premise, leading to a conclusion. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolized as \"M \u2192 S\", where \"M\" stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \"S\" stands for \"Sue was at the wedding\".\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolized as \"S\".\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Mary was at the wedding.\" This can be symbolized as \"M\".\n\nThe argument can be summarized as follows:\n- Premise 1: M \u2192 S\n- Premise 2: S\n- Conclusion: M\n\nTo determine if this argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In logical terms, an argument is valid if, whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThe form of this argument is known as \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a common logical fallacy. In this form, the argument assumes that because the consequent (S) is true, the antecedent (M) must also be true. However, this is not a valid form of reasoning. The truth of the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent.\n\nFor example, consider a situation where the conditional \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, but Sue could have been at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's presence. Therefore, the fact that Sue was at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was there.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
