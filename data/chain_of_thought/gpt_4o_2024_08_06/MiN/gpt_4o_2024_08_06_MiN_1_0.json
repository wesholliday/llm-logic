            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' from 'Mary might not have been at the wedding', we need to analyze the modal verbs and their implications.\n\nThe statement 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' uses the modal verb 'might', which indicates possibility. This means that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding, but it does not definitively state that she was not there. It leaves open the possibility that she was there.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' uses the modal verb 'must', which indicates necessity. Saying 'Mary must have been at the wedding' would mean that it is necessary or certain that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nThe negation 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' implies that it is not necessary or certain that Mary was at the wedding. This aligns with the original statement 'Mary might not have been at the wedding', which suggests that there is no certainty about her presence at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding, it logically follows that it is not necessary that she was there. Thus, the inference from 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' to 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
