            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' from 'Sue might not have chosen pizza', we need to analyze the logical implications of both statements.\n\nThe statement 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' suggests that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This means that while it is possible that she did choose pizza, it is also possible that she did not. The key here is the word 'might', which indicates uncertainty and the presence of multiple possibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' implies that it is not necessary for Sue to have chosen pizza. In other words, there is no requirement or certainty that Sue chose pizza; she could have chosen something else.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n\n1. 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' indicates that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza, which means it is not certain that she chose pizza.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' indicates that it is not necessary or certain that Sue chose pizza.\n\nBoth statements convey a lack of certainty about Sue choosing pizza. The first statement allows for the possibility that she did not choose pizza, and the second statement explicitly denies the necessity of her having chosen pizza. Therefore, the first statement logically supports the inference of the second statement because if there is a possibility that she did not choose pizza, then it cannot be the case that she must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
