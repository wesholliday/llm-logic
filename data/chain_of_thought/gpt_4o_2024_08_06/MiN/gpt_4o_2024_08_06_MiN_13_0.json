            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box' from 'The toy might not be in the toy box', we need to analyze the logical implications of both statements.\n\nThe statement 'The toy might not be in the toy box' suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box. This means that the toy could either be in the toy box or not in the toy box; both scenarios are possible.\n\nThe statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box' means that it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box. In other words, there is no requirement or obligation for the toy to be in the toy box, allowing for the possibility that it might not be there.\n\nIf 'The toy might not be in the toy box' is true, it implies that there is no certainty or necessity for the toy to be in the toy box. Therefore, it aligns with the idea that 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box', because the presence of the toy in the toy box is not guaranteed or required.\n\nThus, the original statement logically supports the inference that the toy is not required to be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
