            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' from 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt', we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements.\n\nThe original statement, 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt', suggests that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This means that it is not certain that she bought it; there is some doubt or uncertainty about whether the purchase occurred.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer, 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', implies that it is not necessary or certain that Lisa bought the red shirt. In other words, there is no requirement or obligation that she did buy it.\n\nBoth statements deal with the certainty of Lisa's action regarding the red shirt. The original statement indicates a lack of certainty about the purchase, which aligns with the inferred statement that it is not necessary or certain that she bought it. Therefore, the original statement logically supports the inference that it is not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
