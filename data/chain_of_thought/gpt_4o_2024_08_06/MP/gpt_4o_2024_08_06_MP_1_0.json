            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" which corresponds to P being true.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. Since we have established that P (Mary was at the wedding) is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, given that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true and \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, we can logically infer that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
