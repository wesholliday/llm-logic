            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" which corresponds to P being true.\n\nIn logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can use a rule of inference called \"modus ponens\" to conclude that Q must also be true. Modus ponens is a valid form of argument that allows us to infer the consequent (Q) from the antecedent (P) when the conditional statement and the antecedent are both true.\n\nTherefore, given the conditional statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and the fact that \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" we can validly infer that \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
