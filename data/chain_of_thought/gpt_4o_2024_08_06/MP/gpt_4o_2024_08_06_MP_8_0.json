            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The mummy was awake' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"V \u2192 M,\" where \"V\" stands for \"The vampire was awake\" and \"M\" stands for \"The mummy was awake.\" This means that whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake.\n\nThe second statement is \"The vampire was awake,\" which can be represented as \"V.\"\n\nIn logical reasoning, if we have a conditional statement \"V \u2192 M\" and we know that \"V\" is true, we can apply a rule known as \"modus ponens.\" Modus ponens allows us to conclude that \"M\" must also be true. This is because the truth of \"V\" guarantees the truth of \"M\" according to the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, given the statements \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" and \"The vampire was awake,\" we can logically infer that \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
