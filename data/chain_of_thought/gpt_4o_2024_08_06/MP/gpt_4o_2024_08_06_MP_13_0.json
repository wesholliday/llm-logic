            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The truck was blue' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The car was red,\" which corresponds to P being true.\n\nIn logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can use a rule called \"modus ponens\" to conclude that Q must also be true. Modus ponens is a valid form of argument that allows us to infer the consequent (Q) from the antecedent (P) when the conditional statement and the antecedent are both true.\n\nTherefore, given the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and the fact that \"The car was red,\" we can validly infer that \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
