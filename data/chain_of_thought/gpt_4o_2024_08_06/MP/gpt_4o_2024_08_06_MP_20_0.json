            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The banana was yellow' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The apple was red,\" which corresponds to P being true.\n\nIn logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can use a rule called \"modus ponens\" to conclude that Q must also be true. Modus ponens is a valid form of argument that allows us to infer the consequent (Q) from the antecedent (P) when the conditional statement and the antecedent are both true.\n\nApplying modus ponens to our situation:\n1. If the apple was red (P), then the banana was yellow (Q).\n2. The apple was red (P is true).\n\nFrom these two premises, we can validly infer:\n3. The banana was yellow (Q is true).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical rule of modus ponens, we can indeed infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
