            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The truck was metal' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The doll was plastic,\" which corresponds to P being true.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. This is known as modus ponens, a valid form of argument. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and P is true, then we can conclude Q is true.\n\nApplying modus ponens to the given statements:\n1. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (If P, then Q)\n2. \"The doll was plastic\" (P is true)\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n3. \"The truck was metal\" (Q is true)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus ponens, we can indeed infer that \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
