However, the meaning remains the same because the conjunction \"and\" in both cases indicates that both conditions are required. The omission of \"it must\" does not change the requirement that \"blimple quazzle flim\" must occur.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement maintains the same meaning as the original statement, and we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
