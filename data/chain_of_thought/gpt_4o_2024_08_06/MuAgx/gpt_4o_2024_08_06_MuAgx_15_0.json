However, the meaning conveyed by both statements is essentially the same: the frozz must satisfy both conditions - being \"zooble quimble plonk\" and \"plimp a quimble.\"\n\nThe second statement is a more concise way of expressing the same requirements without the explicit separation of the two conditions. Therefore, the second statement can be inferred from the first because it conveys the same meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
