In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the reverse: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This would be represented as \"If Q, then P.\"\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If Q, then P.\" The latter is known as the converse of the original statement, and a statement and its converse are not logically equivalent. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nFor example, consider the statement: \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" This does not mean that \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining,\" because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet, such as someone watering the garden.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement, we cannot infer the converse. \n\nAnswer: no",
