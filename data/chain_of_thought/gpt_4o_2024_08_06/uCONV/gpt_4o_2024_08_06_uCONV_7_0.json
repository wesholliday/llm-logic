In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If A, then C,\" where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the reverse: \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race,\" which would be \"If C, then A.\"\n\nTo determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the nature of conditional statements. The original statement \"If A, then C\" does not imply \"If C, then A.\" This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Just because the consequent (C) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (A) is true.\n\nFor example, consider the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\" If we observe that the ground is wet, we cannot conclude that it is raining, because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (such as someone watering the garden).\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" we cannot logically infer that \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
