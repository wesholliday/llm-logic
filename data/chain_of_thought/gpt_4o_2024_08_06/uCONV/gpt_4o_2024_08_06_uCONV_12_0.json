In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park,\" which is \"If Q, then P.\" This is known as the converse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse. The original statement only tells us what happens if Joe goes to the park, not what happens if Lucy goes to the zoo. There could be other reasons or conditions under which Lucy goes to the zoo that do not involve Joe going to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the converse from the original statement without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
