            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the reverse: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding,\" which would be \"If Q, then P.\"\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If Q, then P.\" The reverse of a conditional statement is known as the converse, and the truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nTo illustrate, consider a scenario where Mary being at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence, but Sue could attend the wedding independently of Mary's presence. For example, Sue might attend the wedding regardless of whether Mary is there or not. Therefore, Sue's presence does not necessarily imply Mary's presence.\n\nThus, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding, based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
