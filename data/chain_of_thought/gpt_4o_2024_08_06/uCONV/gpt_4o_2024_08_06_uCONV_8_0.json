            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statement and the inference we are trying to make. The original statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"V \u2192 M,\" where \"V\" stands for \"the vampire was awake\" and \"M\" stands for \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" means that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not imply that if Q is true, then P must be true. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" \n\nTo determine if the inference \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" (M \u2192 V) is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement only tells us what happens when the vampire is awake; it does not provide any information about what happens when the mummy is awake. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the vampire must be awake if the mummy is awake based solely on the original statement.\n\nIn summary, the original statement does not provide enough information to infer the reverse relationship. The truth of the mummy being awake does not necessarily imply the truth of the vampire being awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
