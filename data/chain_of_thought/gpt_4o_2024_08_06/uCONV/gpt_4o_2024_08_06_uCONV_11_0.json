In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate,\" which is \"If Q, then P.\"\n\nIn logic, the original statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply \"If Q, then P.\" This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P must be true. There could be other reasons or conditions under which Q could be true without P being true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate, based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
