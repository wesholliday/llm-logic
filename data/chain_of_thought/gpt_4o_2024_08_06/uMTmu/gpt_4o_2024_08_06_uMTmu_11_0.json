            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n\n1. If C (cake is chocolate), then B (muffins are blueberry).\n\nThis is a standard \"if-then\" statement, which can be written as C \u2192 B.\n\nThe second statement is: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This is a negation of the conclusion of the first statement, which can be represented as:\n\n2. Not B (the muffins are not blueberry).\n\nIn logical terms, this is \u00acB.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the cake was not chocolate (\u00acC) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement C \u2192 B and we know that B is false (\u00acB), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer that C must also be false. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as:\n\n- If C \u2192 B (if C, then B)\n- \u00acB (not B)\n- Therefore, \u00acC (not C)\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n\n- We have C \u2192 B (if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry).\n- We have \u00acB (the muffins are not blueberry).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude \u00acC (the cake is not chocolate).\n\nAnswer: yes",
