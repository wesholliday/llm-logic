            "content": "Explanation: \nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine if we can logically infer that the book was not written by James.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as: \n   - If P (the book was written by James), then Q (the book is a mystery novel).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\" This can be interpreted as:\n   - Not Q (the book is not a mystery novel).\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to conclude that the book was not written by James (Not P).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (Not Q), we can use a form of reasoning called \"modus tollens\" to conclude that P must also be false (Not P). \n\nApplying this to our situation:\n- We have \"If P, then Q\" (If the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel).\n- We also have \"Not Q\" (The book is not a mystery novel).\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude:\n- Not P (The book was not written by James).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
