            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If A (the apple was red), then B (the banana was yellow).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This is the negation of B, which can be represented as:\n   - Not B (the banana was not yellow).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false (Not B), we can infer that A must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive rule, which states that if \"If A, then B\" is true, then \"If not B, then not A\" is also true.\n\nApplying this rule to our statements:\n- We have \"If A, then B\" (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow).\n- We also have Not B (the banana was not yellow).\n\nTherefore, by the contrapositive rule, we can infer Not A (the apple was not red).\n\nAnswer: yes",
