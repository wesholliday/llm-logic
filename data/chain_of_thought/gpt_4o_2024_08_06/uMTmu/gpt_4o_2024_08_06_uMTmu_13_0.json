            "content": "Explanation: \n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine what can be logically inferred from them.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If P (the car was red), then Q (the truck was blue).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\" This is a negation of Q, which can be represented as:\n   - Not Q (the truck was not blue).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (Not Q), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer that P must also be false. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as:\n   - If P implies Q, and Not Q is true, then Not P must be true.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n- We have \"If the car was red (P), then the truck was blue (Q).\"\n- We also have \"Not Q\" (the truck was not blue).\n\nFrom these, we can infer \"Not P\" (the car was not red).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
