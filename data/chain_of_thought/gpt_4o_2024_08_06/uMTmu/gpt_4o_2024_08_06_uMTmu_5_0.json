            "content": "Explanation: The problem presents a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be represented logically as \"If J, then A,\" where J represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and A represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nWe are also given the information \"it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be interpreted as the negation of A, which is \"not A.\"\n\nIn logical terms, the statement \"If J, then A\" can be written as J \u2192 A. The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not A, then not J\" (\u00acA \u2192 \u00acJ), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven that \"it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\" (\u00acA), we can use the contrapositive to infer \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (\u00acJ).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logical structure of the statements, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
