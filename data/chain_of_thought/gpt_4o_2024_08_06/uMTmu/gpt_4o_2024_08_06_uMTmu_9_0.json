            "content": "Explanation: \nThe problem presents a logical implication and a negation. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" can be represented as a conditional statement: \n   - If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n2. The second statement is \"it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt,\" which is the negation of M:\n   - Not M (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If L, then M\" and we know \"Not M\" (the negation of the consequent), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"Not L\" (the negation of the antecedent). \n\nModus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as:\n- If P, then Q.\n- Not Q.\n- Therefore, Not P.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n- If L, then M.\n- Not M.\n- Therefore, Not L.\n\nThus, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
