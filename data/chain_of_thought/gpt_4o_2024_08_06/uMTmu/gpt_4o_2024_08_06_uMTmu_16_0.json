            "content": "Explanation: The problem presents a conditional statement and its contrapositive. The conditional statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be symbolically represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants must have been denim.\"\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is: \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" Symbolically, this is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nThe problem also states, \"it's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This is equivalent to saying \"not Q\" (the pants were not denim).\n\nGiven \"not Q\" and the contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P,\" we can logically infer \"not P\" (the shirt was not cotton).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided and the logical structure of the statements, we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
