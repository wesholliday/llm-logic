            "content": "Explanation: \nThe problem presents a logical implication and a negation. Let's break it down:\n\n1. The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding). \n   - This is written as M \u2192 S.\n\n2. The statement \"it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\" is a negation of Sue being at the wedding:\n   - This is written as \u00acS.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acM (Mary was not at the wedding) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have M \u2192 S and \u00acS, we can use a rule called \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens states that if you have a conditional statement (if P then Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), you can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nApplying modus tollens to our situation:\n- We have M \u2192 S (if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding).\n- We also have \u00acS (Sue was not at the wedding).\n\nFrom these, we can infer \u00acM (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the application of logical reasoning, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
