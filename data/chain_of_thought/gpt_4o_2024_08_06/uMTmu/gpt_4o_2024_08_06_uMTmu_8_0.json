            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical statements given and determine what can be inferred from them.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as: \n   - If V (vampire is awake), then M (mummy is awake). \n   - This can be written as: V \u2192 M.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\" This means that it is not necessarily true that the mummy was awake. In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n   - Not M (the mummy is not necessarily awake).\n\nNow, let's analyze these statements together:\n\n- From the first statement (V \u2192 M), we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. \n- The second statement tells us that the mummy was not necessarily awake (\u00acM).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (V \u2192 M) and we know that the consequent (M) is false (\u00acM), then the antecedent (V) must also be false. This is because the only way for the conditional statement to be true when the consequent is false is if the antecedent is also false. This is known as the contrapositive rule, which states that if V \u2192 M, then \u00acM \u2192 \u00acV.\n\nTherefore, given that the mummy was not necessarily awake (\u00acM), we can infer that the vampire was not awake (\u00acV).\n\nAnswer: yes",
