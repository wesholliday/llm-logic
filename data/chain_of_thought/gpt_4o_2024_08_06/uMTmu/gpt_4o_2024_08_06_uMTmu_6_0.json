The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This can be represented as: \n   - If P (Sue chose pizza), then Q (Bob chose pasta).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\" This is a negation of the conclusion of the first statement, which can be represented as:\n   - Not Q (Bob did not choose pasta).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza (Not P) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven the original statement \"If P, then Q\" (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta), the contrapositive is \"If not Q, then not P\" (If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nSince we have \"Not Q\" (Bob did not choose pasta) from the second statement, we can apply the contrapositive of the first statement to conclude \"Not P\" (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
