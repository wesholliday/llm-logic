            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If P (Joe went to the park), then Q (Lucy went to the zoo).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This is a negation of Q, which can be represented as:\n   - Not Q (Lucy did not go to the zoo).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false (Not Q), we can infer that P must also be false. This is known as the contrapositive rule, which states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true, then \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true.\n\nApplying this rule to our statements:\n- We have \"If Joe went to the park (P), then Lucy went to the zoo (Q).\"\n- We also have \"Lucy did not go to the zoo (Not Q).\"\n\nFrom these, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
