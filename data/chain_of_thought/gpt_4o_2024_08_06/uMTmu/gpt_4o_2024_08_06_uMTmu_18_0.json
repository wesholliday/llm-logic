            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine if we can logically infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n\n- P \u2192 M\n\nwhere P represents \"the doll was plastic\" and M represents \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe second statement is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This is the negation of M, which can be represented as:\n\n- \u00acM\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement P \u2192 M and we know that \u00acM is true, we can use the rule of modus tollens to infer \u00acP. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that allows us to conclude the negation of the antecedent if the consequent is false. In this case, since the consequent (M) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
