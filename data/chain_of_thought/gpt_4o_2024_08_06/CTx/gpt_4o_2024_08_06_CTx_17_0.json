The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe statement 'If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled' is the contrapositive of the original statement. Here, 'not Q' is 'the flob did not movated' and 'not P' is 'the flob was not skizzled'.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a true conditional statement is always true, we can infer 'If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled' from 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
