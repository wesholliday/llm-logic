            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the flug was blummed\" and Q is \"the flug was zimmed.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" is \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed,\" we can indeed infer \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
