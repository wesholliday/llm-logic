The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer, 'If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled', is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logical terms, it is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled' from 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
