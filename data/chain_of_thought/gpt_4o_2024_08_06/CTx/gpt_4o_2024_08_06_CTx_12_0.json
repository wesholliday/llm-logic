The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer, 'If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped', is the contrapositive of the original statement. Here, 'not Q' is 'the smip did not lup the zoint' and 'not P' is 'the smip was not shripped'.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped' from 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
