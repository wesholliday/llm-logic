The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled,\" we can indeed infer \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
