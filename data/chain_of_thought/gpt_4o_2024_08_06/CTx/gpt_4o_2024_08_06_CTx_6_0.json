The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe statement we are asked to infer, 'If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed', is the contrapositive of the original statement. Here, 'not Q' is 'the grommet did not plop the frink' and 'not P' is 'the grommet was not sploffed'.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is always true, we can indeed infer 'If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed' from 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
