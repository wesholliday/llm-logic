The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer, 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled', is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logical terms, it is 'If not Q, then not P'.\n\nSince the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
