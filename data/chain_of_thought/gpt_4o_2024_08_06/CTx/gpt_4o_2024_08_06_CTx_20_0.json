The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe statement we are asked to infer is \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered\", which can be represented as \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). This is exactly the contrapositive of the original statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" (P \u2192 Q).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a true statement is always true, we can indeed infer \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
