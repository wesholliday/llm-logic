            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the clug was fleeked\" and Q is \"the clug snugged.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" is \"If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked.\" This matches the statement we are trying to infer: \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the rules of logical equivalence, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
