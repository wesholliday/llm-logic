In logical terms, it is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\" from \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
