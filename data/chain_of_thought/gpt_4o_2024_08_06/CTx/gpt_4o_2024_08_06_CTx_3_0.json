            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed' from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' can be represented in logical terms as 'M \u2192 Q', where 'M' stands for 'the splat was morphed' and 'Q' stands for 'the splat quanked'. This is a conditional statement.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed', can be represented as '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acM'. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive. This means that if the original statement 'M \u2192 Q' is true, then the contrapositive '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acM' is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked', we can indeed infer 'If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
