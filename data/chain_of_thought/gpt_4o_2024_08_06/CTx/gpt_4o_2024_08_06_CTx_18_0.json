The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe statement we are asked to infer is \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked,\" which is the contrapositive of the original statement. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer this statement from the original.\n\nAnswer: yes",
