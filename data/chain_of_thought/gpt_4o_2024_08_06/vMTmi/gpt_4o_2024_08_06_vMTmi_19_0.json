            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. (This is a conditional statement: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\))\n2. Premise 2: Jen might not have watched basketball. (This suggests that it is possible that \\( \\neg J \\) is true)\n3. Conclusion: Tom did not watch football. (This is \\( \\neg T \\))\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we need to see if the conclusion (\\( \\neg T \\)) logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) can be understood as: if the antecedent (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. \n\nThe second premise suggests that it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball (\\( \\neg J \\)). This implies that the consequent of the first premise might not be true.\n\nIn classical logic, if the consequent of a conditional statement is false, then the antecedent must also be false for the conditional to hold true. This is because a conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is only false when \\( T \\) is true and \\( J \\) is false. Therefore, if \\( J \\) is false (\\( \\neg J \\)), then \\( T \\) must also be false (\\( \\neg T \\)) to maintain the truth of the conditional.\n\nThus, given that it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball, it follows that Tom did not watch football, as this is the only way the conditional statement can remain true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"Tom did not watch football\" logically follows from the premises, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
