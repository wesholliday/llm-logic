            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. (This can be represented as: M \u2192 S, where M is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S is \"Sue was at the wedding\".)\n2. Premise 2: Sue might not have been at the wedding. (This suggests that it is possible that S is false, but it does not definitively state that S is false.)\n3. Conclusion: Mary was not at the wedding. (This is represented as \u00acM, where \u00acM is \"Mary was not at the wedding\".)\n\nTo evaluate the validity, we need to see if the conclusion (\u00acM) necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nPremise 1 (M \u2192 S) tells us that if M is true, then S must be true. In other words, if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was definitely at the wedding.\n\nPremise 2 states that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This introduces the possibility that S is false, but it does not confirm it. It only suggests that S is not necessarily true.\n\nFor the conclusion (\u00acM) to be validly derived from the premises, we would need to establish that M cannot be true given the premises. However, Premise 2 does not provide a definitive statement about S being false; it only suggests a possibility. Therefore, it does not provide enough information to conclude definitively that M is false.\n\nIn logical terms, the argument is attempting to use a form of modus tollens, which requires a definitive statement that S is false to conclude \u00acM. Since Premise 2 only suggests that S might not be true, it does not fulfill the requirement for a valid modus tollens argument.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that \"Mary was not at the wedding\" does not necessarily follow from the premises given, because the possibility of S being false is not sufficient to conclude \u00acM.\n\nAnswer: no",
