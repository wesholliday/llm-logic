            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether the statement \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" can be inferred from \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe statement \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\" However, the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
