            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis,\" we need to consider the logical structure of this new statement, which is \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). This is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. The original statement (P \u2192 Q) only tells us that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. It does not provide any information about what happens when P is false. Therefore, the inverse (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ) is not logically equivalent to the original statement and cannot be inferred from it.\n\nThe only valid logical inference from the original statement is its contrapositive, which is \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
