The statement \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\" can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). This form of inference is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The only valid inferences that can be made from a conditional statement are its contrapositive and its converse. The contrapositive of the original statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The converse \"If Q, then P\" (Q \u2192 P) is also not equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\", we cannot logically infer \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta\".\n\nAnswer: no",
