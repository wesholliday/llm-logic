            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim,\" we need to consider the logical structure of this new statement. This new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, which would be \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). However, the statement given is \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ), which is the inverse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true. However, the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The truth of the inverse cannot be determined solely based on the truth of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
