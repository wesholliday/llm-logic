            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den,\" we need to consider the logical structure of this new statement. This new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, which would be \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). However, the statement given is \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ), which is the inverse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true. However, the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The truth of the inverse cannot be determined solely from the truth of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" we cannot infer the inverse \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den\" because the truth of the inverse is not guaranteed by the truth of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
