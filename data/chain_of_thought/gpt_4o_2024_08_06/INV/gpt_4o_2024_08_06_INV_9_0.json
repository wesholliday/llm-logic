            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\".\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\" is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\". The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nTherefore, from the original statement, we cannot infer the inverse. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of the inverse.\n\nAnswer: no",
