            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement. In logic, this is often represented as \"If A, then C\" (A \u2192 C), where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race,\" we need to consider the logical structure of the original statement. The statement we are trying to infer is \"If not A, then not C\" (\u00acA \u2192 \u00acC).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then C\" is \"If not C, then not A\" (\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If not A, then not C\" (\u00acA \u2192 \u00acC) is not the contrapositive of the original statement. Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nIn summary, from the statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race,\" we cannot logically infer \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
