            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\" In logical terms, this is \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nThis type of inference is known as the inverse of the original conditional statement. In logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. The only logically equivalent statement to the original conditional is its contrapositive, which would be \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\" (If not Q, then not P).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse \"If not P, then not Q\" from the original statement \"If P, then Q\" because the truth of the original statement does not imply the truth of its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no",
