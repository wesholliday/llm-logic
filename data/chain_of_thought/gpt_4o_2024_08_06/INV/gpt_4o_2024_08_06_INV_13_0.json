            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue,\" we need to consider the logical structure of this new statement. This new statement is \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ), which is known as the inverse of the original conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The only statements that are logically equivalent to the original conditional are the contrapositive and the original statement itself. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue,\" because the inverse is not a valid logical inference from the original conditional.\n\nAnswer: no",
