            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake' from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as 'V \u2192 M', where 'V' stands for 'the vampire was awake' and 'M' stands for 'the mummy was awake'. This means that whenever the vampire is awake, the mummy must also be awake.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake', which can be represented as '\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM'. This is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. The original statement 'V \u2192 M' only tells us what happens when the vampire is awake, not what happens when the vampire is not awake. The mummy could still be awake or not awake independently of the vampire's state when the vampire is not awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse '\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM' from the original statement 'V \u2192 M' without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
