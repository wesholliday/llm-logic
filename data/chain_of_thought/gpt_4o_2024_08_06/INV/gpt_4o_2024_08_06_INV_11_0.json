            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" is not the contrapositive; it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\" The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, even if the original statement is true, the inverse may not necessarily be true.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the inverse from the original statement, we need additional information. Without such information, we cannot logically infer the inverse from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
