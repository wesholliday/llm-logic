            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad\". \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\", we cannot logically infer the inverse \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\". The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse.\n\nAnswer: no",
