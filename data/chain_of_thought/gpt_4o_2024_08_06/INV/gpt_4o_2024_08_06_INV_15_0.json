            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" from the original statement, we need to understand the logical structure of the inference. The statement \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" is the inverse of the original statement, which can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) does not guarantee the truth of its inverse (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The only valid inferences that can be made from a conditional statement are its contrapositive and its converse. The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The converse, \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" (Q \u2192 P), is also not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" from the original statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
