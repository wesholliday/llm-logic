            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\" The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nTo clarify, the original statement tells us that Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Mary is not present. Sue could still be at the wedding even if Mary is not, according to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
