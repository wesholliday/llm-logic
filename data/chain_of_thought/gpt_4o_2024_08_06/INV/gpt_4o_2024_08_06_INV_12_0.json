            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" from the original statement. This new statement can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nIn logic, the inference from \"If P, then Q\" to \"If not P, then not Q\" is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. This is not a valid logical inference. The original statement only tells us what happens if Joe goes to the park; it does not provide any information about what happens if Joe does not go to the park. Lucy going to the zoo could be independent of Joe's actions, or there could be other conditions under which Lucy goes to the zoo.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
