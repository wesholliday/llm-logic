            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"G \u2192 U\", where G represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and U represents \"the unicorn was in the forest\". \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\", which means \"if not Q, then not P\". The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" is the inverse of the original statement, which is \"\u00acG \u2192 \u00acU\". The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of the inverse.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\", we cannot infer \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\".\n\nAnswer: no",
