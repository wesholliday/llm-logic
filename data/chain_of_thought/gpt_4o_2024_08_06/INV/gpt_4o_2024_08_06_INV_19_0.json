            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball\" is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nThe truth of the inverse is not guaranteed by the truth of the original statement. The original statement only tells us what happens if Tom watches football (P), not what happens if he does not watch football (\u00acP). Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
