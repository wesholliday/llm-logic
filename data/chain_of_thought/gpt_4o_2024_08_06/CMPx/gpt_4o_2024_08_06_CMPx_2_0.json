    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

We have three applicants: jantiz, cramen, and sulect.\n2. The jantiz is the most qualified, followed by the cramen, and then the sulect.\n3. It is stated that the jantiz is likely to get the zulision, which implies that the cramen is less likely to get it, and the sulect is even less likely.\n4. The condition given is that if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will.\n\nLet's break this down:\n- The jantiz is the most qualified and likely to get the position. However, we are considering the scenario where the jantiz does not get the zulision.\n- If the jantiz does not get the zulision, the decision is between the cramen and the sulect.\n- The condition states that if the cramen doesn\u2019t get it, then the sulect will. This implies that in the absence of the jantiz, the cramen is the next likely candidate, but if for some reason the cramen is not chosen, the sulect will be.\n\nThe key point here is the likelihood of the cramen not getting the zulision if the jantiz is out of the picture. Since the cramen is more qualified than the sulect, it is less likely that the cramen will be passed over in favor of the sulect unless there is a specific reason or condition that prevents the cramen from being chosen.\n\nTherefore, while the condition states that the sulect will get the zulision if the cramen doesn\u2019t, the likelihood of the cramen not getting it (given the jantiz is out) is low because the cramen is more qualified than the sulect.\n\nAnswer: no",
