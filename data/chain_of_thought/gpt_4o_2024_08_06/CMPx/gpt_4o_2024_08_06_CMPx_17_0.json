    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether it is likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will, we need to analyze the given information and the logical implications.\n\n1. We have three prospects: a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen.\n2. The flinker is the most likely to have a breakout season, followed by the dringen, with the n\u00fcffen being the least likely.\n3. If the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, and the flinker also doesn\u2019t, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n4. Scouts believe the flinker will likely have a breakout season, which implies the dringen likely won't have a breakout season.\n\nGiven these points, let's consider the scenario where the flinker does not have a breakout season:\n\n- If the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, we need to check the condition for the n\u00fcffen to have a breakout season.\n- The condition given is: if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season and the flinker doesn\u2019t, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n- Since it is likely that the flinker will have a breakout season, it is also likely that the dringen will not have a breakout season (as per the scouts' belief).\n- Therefore, if the flinker does not have a breakout season, it is likely that the dringen also does not have a breakout season, which satisfies the condition for the n\u00fcffen to have a breakout season.\n\nThus, based on the given conditions and the scouts' beliefs, it is likely that if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nAnswer: yes",
