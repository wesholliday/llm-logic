    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether it is likely that the jentapp will be selected if the stribben isn't, we need to analyze the given conditions and the likelihood of each scenario.\n\n1. The owner ranks the applicants as follows: stribben is the strongest, followed by the vanoon, and the jentapp is much less qualified.\n2. The owner is likely to choose the stribben, which implies that the vanoon is less likely to be chosen.\n3. If the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, and the stribben isn\u2019t selected, then the jentapp will be selected.\n\nLet's break down the scenarios:\n\n- If the stribben is selected, the question of whether the jentapp will be selected if the stribben isn't becomes irrelevant because the stribben is already chosen.\n- If the stribben isn't selected, the owner must choose between the vanoon and the jentapp.\n- The condition states that if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, and the stribben isn\u2019t selected, then the jentapp will be selected.\n\nGiven that the stribben is likely to be chosen, the scenario where the stribben isn't selected is less likely. However, if we are specifically considering the scenario where the stribben isn't selected, we must then consider the likelihood of the vanoon being selected.\n\nSince the vanoon is ranked higher than the jentapp, if the stribben isn't selected, it is more likely that the vanoon will be chosen over the jentapp. However, the condition explicitly states that if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then the jentapp will be selected.\n\nTherefore, in the specific scenario where the stribben isn't selected, the likelihood of the jentapp being selected depends on whether the vanoon is chosen. If the vanoon isn't chosen, then the jentapp will be selected by default.\n\nThus, while the overall likelihood of the jentapp being selected is low due to the stribben's strong candidacy, in the specific case where the stribben isn't selected, the jentapp will indeed be selected if the vanoon also isn't chosen.\n\nAnswer: yes",
