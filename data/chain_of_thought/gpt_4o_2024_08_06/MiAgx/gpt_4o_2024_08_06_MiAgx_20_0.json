'The plimp might be zibble'\n2. 'The snizzle might quank wumble'\n\nThe word 'might' in both parts indicates a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, each part suggests that it is possible, but not guaranteed, that the plimp is zibble and that the snizzle quanks wumble.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is:\n'It might be that the plimp is zibble and the snizzle quanks wumble'\n\nThis inferred statement combines the two possibilities into a single statement of possibility. It suggests that it is possible for both conditions to be true simultaneously.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility of each condition independently, it also allows for the possibility of both conditions being true at the same time. Therefore, the inferred statement is logically consistent with the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
