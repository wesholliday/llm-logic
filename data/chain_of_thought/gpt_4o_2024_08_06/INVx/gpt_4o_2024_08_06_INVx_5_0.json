            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and Q is \"the zinger was smoogled\".\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" from the original statement, we need to understand what this new statement represents. This new statement is the inverse of the original conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q\" (~P \u2192 ~Q).\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The only statements that are logically equivalent to the original conditional statement are its contrapositive and itself. The contrapositive of the original statement is \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" (~Q \u2192 ~P), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the inverse \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" from the original statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
