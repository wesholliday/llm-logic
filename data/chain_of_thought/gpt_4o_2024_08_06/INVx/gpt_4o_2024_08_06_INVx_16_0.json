            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer the statement 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink' from the given statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe given statement is a conditional statement of the form 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the sneg was crampled' and Q is 'the sneg sproted the frink'. In logic, this is written as P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is 'If not P, then not Q', which is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement we are trying to infer is \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ, which is not the contrapositive but rather the inverse of the original statement.\n\nThe inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
