            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank,\" we need to consider the logical structure of this new statement. This new statement is \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ), which is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The only statements that are logically equivalent to the original conditional statement are its contrapositive and itself. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked,\" we cannot infer \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" because the inverse is not a logically valid inference from the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
