The latter is known as the inverse of the original statement, and the truth of the inverse is not guaranteed by the truth of the original statement. The only valid inference that can be made from 'If P, then Q' is its contrapositive, which is 'If not Q, then not P'. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If not P, then not Q' from 'If P, then Q'.\n\nAnswer: no",
