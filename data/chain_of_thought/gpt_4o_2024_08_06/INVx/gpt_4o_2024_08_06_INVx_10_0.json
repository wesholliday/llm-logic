            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"the wug was garpled.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled,\" we need to consider the logical structure of this new statement, which is \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). This is known as the inverse of the original conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The only statements that are logically equivalent to the original conditional are its contrapositive and itself. The contrapositive of the original statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
