This is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) does not guarantee the truth of its inverse (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The only statements that are logically equivalent to the original conditional are its contrapositive (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP) and the original statement itself.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
