            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" is a conditional statement. In logic, this is often represented as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the smip was shripped\" and Q is \"the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint,\" which is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\" is not the contrapositive; it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nIn summary, from the original statement, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
