            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint,\" we need to consider the logical structure of this new statement. This is an example of the inverse of the original conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nIn classical logic, the truth of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) does not guarantee the truth of its inverse (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The only statements that are logically equivalent to the original conditional are its contrapositive (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which states \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nTherefore, from the original statement \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
