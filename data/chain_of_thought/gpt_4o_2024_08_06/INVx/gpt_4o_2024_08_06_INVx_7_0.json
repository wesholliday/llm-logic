This is a conditional statement.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer, 'If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink', can be represented as 'If not P, then not Q'. This is known as the inverse of the original conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, the truth of a conditional statement does not guarantee the truth of its inverse. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original conditional statement. The only statements that are logically equivalent to a conditional statement are its contrapositive ('If not Q, then not P') and the original statement itself.\n\nTherefore, from the statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked', we cannot logically infer 'If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink'.\n\nAnswer: no",
