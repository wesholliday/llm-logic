            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink,\" we need to consider the logical concept of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\" is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q\" (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ). The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, even if the original statement is true, the inverse may not necessarily be true.\n\nIn summary, from the statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\" because the latter is the inverse, not the contrapositive, of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
