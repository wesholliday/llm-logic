            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nTo determine if we can infer \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled,\" we need to consider the logical concept of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" is not the contrapositive; it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\" The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, even if the original statement is true, the inverse may not necessarily be true.\n\nIn summary, from the statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" because the latter is the inverse, not the contrapositive, of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
