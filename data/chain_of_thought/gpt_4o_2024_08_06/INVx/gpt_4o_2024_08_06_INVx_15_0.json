The only valid inference that can be made from \"If P, then Q\" is its contrapositive, which is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened,\" we cannot logically infer \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
