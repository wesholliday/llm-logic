            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf\" is a logical disjunction. In logic, a disjunction is true if at least one of the components is true. This means that for the disjunction to hold, either the book must be on the table, or it must be on the shelf, or both.\n\nThe second statement, \"The book isn't resting on the table,\" negates one of the possibilities in the disjunction. This means that the first part of the disjunction is false: the book is not on the table.\n\nGiven that the disjunction \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf\" must be true, and we have established that the book is not on the table, the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to be true is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can logically infer that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
