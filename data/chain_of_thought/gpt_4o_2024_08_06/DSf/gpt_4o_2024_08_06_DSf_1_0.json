            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided.\n\n1. The first statement is \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside.\" This is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two statements must be true. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"P or Q,\" where P is \"Fido is in the garden\" and Q is \"Fido is inside.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Fido is not in the garden.\" This is a negation of the first part of the disjunction, which can be represented as \"not P.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction \"P or Q\" and we know that \"not P\" is true, we can infer that Q must be true. This is because the disjunction requires at least one of the statements to be true, and if P is false, then Q must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nApplying this reasoning to the given statements:\n- We have \"P or Q\" (Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside).\n- We also have \"not P\" (Fido is not in the garden).\n\nSince \"not P\" is true, and the disjunction \"P or Q\" must hold, it follows that Q must be true. Therefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
