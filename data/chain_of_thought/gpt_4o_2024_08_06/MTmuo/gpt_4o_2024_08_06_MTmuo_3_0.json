            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The book was not written by James' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel'. This can be interpreted as 'It is not necessary that the book is a mystery novel'. In logical terms, this means that the book being a mystery novel is not a certainty.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement, which can be expressed in logical terms as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the book was written by James' and Q is 'the book must be a mystery novel'.\n\nNow, let's consider what we are trying to infer: 'The book was not written by James'. This is the negation of P in the conditional statement.\n\nTo infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to use the information from both statements:\n\n- The second statement tells us that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel (P implies Q).\n- The first statement tells us that it is not the case that the book must be a mystery novel (not Q).\n\nIn logic, if we have 'If P, then Q' and 'not Q', we can infer 'not P' through a form of reasoning called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that allows us to conclude the negation of the antecedent (P) if we have the negation of the consequent (Q).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
