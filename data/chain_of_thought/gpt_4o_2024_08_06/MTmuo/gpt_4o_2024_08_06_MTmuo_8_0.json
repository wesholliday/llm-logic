            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The vampire was not awake' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.' This can be interpreted as 'It is not necessary that the mummy was awake,' or in logical terms, 'It is not the case that M (the mummy was awake) is necessarily true.' This implies that the mummy could have been either awake or not awake, but it is not a certainty that the mummy was awake.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.' In logical terms, this is a conditional statement: 'If V (the vampire was awake), then M (the mummy was awake).' This can be written as 'V \u2192 M.'\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From the second statement 'V \u2192 M,' we know that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n\n- The first statement tells us that it is not necessary that the mummy was awake. This means that the condition 'M' (the mummy was awake) is not necessarily true.\n\nTo infer 'The vampire was not awake,' we need to show that the negation of 'V' (the vampire was awake) is true, i.e., '\u00acV.'\n\nGiven 'V \u2192 M' and knowing that 'M' is not necessarily true, we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement. The contrapositive of 'V \u2192 M' is '\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV,' which means 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.'\n\nSince the first statement indicates that it is not necessary for the mummy to be awake, it allows for the possibility that the mummy was not awake. If we assume '\u00acM' (the mummy was not awake), then by the contrapositive '\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV,' we can conclude '\u00acV' (the vampire was not awake).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
