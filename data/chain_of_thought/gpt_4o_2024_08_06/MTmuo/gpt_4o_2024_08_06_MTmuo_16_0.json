            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.' This can be interpreted as saying that it is not necessary for the pants to be denim. In logical terms, this means that the statement 'The pants must have been denim' is false.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.' This is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as 'If P, then Q,' where P is 'The shirt was cotton' and Q is 'The pants must have been denim.'\n\nNow, let's consider what we are trying to infer: 'The shirt was not cotton.' In logical terms, this is the negation of P.\n\nTo infer 'The shirt was not cotton' from the given statements, we need to show that the negation of P follows from the information provided.\n\n- From the second statement, we know that if the shirt was cotton (P), then the pants must have been denim (Q).\n- However, the first statement tells us that it is not the case that the pants must have been denim (not Q).\n\nIn logic, if 'If P, then Q' is true and 'not Q' is true, then we can conclude 'not P' (this is known as modus tollens). \n\nTherefore, since 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim' is true and 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim' is also true, we can conclude that 'The shirt was not cotton.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
