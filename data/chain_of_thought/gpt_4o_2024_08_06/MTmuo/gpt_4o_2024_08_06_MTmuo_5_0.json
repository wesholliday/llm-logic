            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis'. This can be interpreted as the negation of 'Amy must have played tennis', which means 'It is not necessary that Amy played tennis'. In logical terms, this can be expressed as '\u00ac\u25a1T', where 'T' represents 'Amy played tennis'.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis'. This is a conditional statement that can be expressed in logical terms as 'B \u2192 \u25a1T', where 'B' represents 'Jeff played basketball'.\n\nNow, we need to determine if these two statements together allow us to infer 'Jeff did not play basketball', which is '\u00acB'.\n\nLet's consider the implications:\n\n- From the second statement 'B \u2192 \u25a1T', we know that if Jeff played basketball, then it must be the case that Amy played tennis.\n\n- The first statement '\u00ac\u25a1T' tells us that it is not necessary that Amy played tennis. This means that the condition '\u25a1T' (Amy must have played tennis) is false.\n\nGiven 'B \u2192 \u25a1T', if '\u25a1T' is false, then for the implication to hold, 'B' must also be false (because if 'B' were true, '\u25a1T' would have to be true for the implication to be true, which contradicts '\u00ac\u25a1T').\n\nTherefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if 'Jeff did not play basketball', i.e., '\u00acB' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
