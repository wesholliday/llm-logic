            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.' This can be interpreted as 'It is not necessary that Mark bought the blue shirt,' or in logical terms, '\u00acM', where M represents 'Mark must have bought the blue shirt.'\n\n2. The second statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.' This is a conditional statement that can be represented as 'L \u2192 M', where L represents 'Lisa bought the red shirt.'\n\nWe are trying to determine if 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' (\u00acL) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nLet's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From the second statement 'L \u2192 M', we know that if L is true, then M must be true.\n- However, the first statement tells us '\u00acM', meaning M is not true.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement 'L \u2192 M' and we know that M is false (\u00acM), then L must also be false to satisfy the conditional. This is because if L were true, M would have to be true as well, which contradicts '\u00acM'.\n\nTherefore, given 'L \u2192 M' and '\u00acM', we can conclude '\u00acL', meaning 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
