            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.' This can be interpreted as 'It is not necessary that Sue was at the wedding,' or in logical terms, 'It is not the case that necessarily Sue was at the wedding.' This can be symbolized as \u00ac\u25a1S, where S represents 'Sue was at the wedding.'\n\n2. The second statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.' This is a conditional statement and can be symbolized as M \u2192 \u25a1S, where M represents 'Mary was at the wedding.'\n\nWe need to determine if these statements together imply 'Mary was not at the wedding,' which is symbolized as \u00acM.\n\nLet's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From the second statement (M \u2192 \u25a1S), if Mary was at the wedding (M is true), then it must be the case that Sue was at the wedding (\u25a1S is true).\n\n- The first statement (\u00ac\u25a1S) tells us that it is not necessary that Sue was at the wedding. This means that the condition 'Sue must have been at the wedding' is false.\n\nNow, consider the implications:\n\n- If M were true (Mary was at the wedding), then according to the second statement, \u25a1S would have to be true (Sue must have been at the wedding).\n\n- However, the first statement tells us that \u25a1S is false (\u00ac\u25a1S). This creates a contradiction if M were true, because M \u2192 \u25a1S would require \u25a1S to be true, but we know from \u00ac\u25a1S that it is not.\n\nTherefore, to avoid this contradiction, M must be false. This means that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
