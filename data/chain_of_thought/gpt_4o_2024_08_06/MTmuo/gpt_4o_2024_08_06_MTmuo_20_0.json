            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.' This can be interpreted as saying that it is not necessarily true that the banana was yellow. In logical terms, this means that the necessity of the banana being yellow is denied.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.' This is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the apple was red' and B is 'the banana must have been yellow.'\n\nNow, let's consider what these statements imply:\n\n- The second statement tells us that if the apple was red, then it necessarily follows that the banana must have been yellow.\n- The first statement tells us that it is not necessarily the case that the banana was yellow.\n\nTo see if we can infer 'The apple was not red', we need to consider the logical implications:\n\n- If the apple were red, then according to the second statement, the banana must have been yellow.\n- However, the first statement contradicts this necessity by saying that it is not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\nThe only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the apple was not red. If the apple were red, it would force the banana to be yellow, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, the only consistent conclusion is that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
