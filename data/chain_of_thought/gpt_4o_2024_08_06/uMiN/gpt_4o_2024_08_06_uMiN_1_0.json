            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, we need to analyze the statements logically.\n\nThe statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not present at the wedding. This implies uncertainty about her attendance. It does not definitively state that she was absent, only that her absence is a possibility.\n\nThe phrase \"Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies certainty about her presence at the wedding. It suggests that there is no doubt that she was there.\n\nIf we are considering the possibility that Mary might not have been at the wedding, it means we cannot be certain that she was there. Therefore, it is not the case that we can definitively say \"Mary must have been at the wedding,\" because the possibility of her absence contradicts the certainty implied by \"must have been.\"\n\nThus, if there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, we cannot assert with certainty that she must have been there. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
