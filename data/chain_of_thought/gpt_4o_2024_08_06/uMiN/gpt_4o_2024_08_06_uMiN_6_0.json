            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" suggests that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This implies that there is uncertainty about whether Sue chose pizza or not. \n\nThe question asks if we can infer that \"it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\" To determine this, we need to understand the meaning of \"must have chosen pizza.\" If Sue \"must have chosen pizza,\" it means that there is no other possibility and that choosing pizza is the only option or outcome.\n\nGiven that \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" indicates the presence of alternative possibilities (i.e., she might have chosen something else), it directly contradicts the idea that she \"must have chosen pizza.\" If there is even a slight possibility that she did not choose pizza, then it cannot be true that she must have chosen it.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza,\" we can indeed infer that it is not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, because the presence of any alternative possibility negates the necessity of her choosing pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
