            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The application must have been completed online and it must have included references.\" This statement is composed of two parts: \n\n1. \"The application must have been completed online.\"\n2. \"It must have included references.\"\n\nThe conjunction \"and\" is used to connect these two requirements, indicating that both conditions must be met for the application to be considered valid.\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" from the original statement. Let's break down the inference:\n\n- The phrase \"The application must have been completed online\" is identical in both the original statement and the inferred statement.\n- The phrase \"it must have included references\" in the original statement is rephrased as \"included references\" in the inferred statement.\n\nThe inferred statement combines the two conditions into a single sentence without changing the meaning of either condition. The use of \"and\" still indicates that both conditions are required. The inferred statement is a more concise way of expressing the same requirements as the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement accurately reflects the meaning of the original statement without omitting or altering any of the conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
