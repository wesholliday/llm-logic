            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The document must have been signed and it must have been notarized.\" This statement is composed of two separate requirements: one is that the document must have been signed, and the other is that it must have been notarized. \n\nWhen we consider the inference \"The document must have been signed and notarized,\" we are essentially combining these two requirements into a single statement. The conjunction \"and\" in logical terms means that both conditions must be true simultaneously. \n\nIn the original statement, the use of \"and\" between \"signed\" and \"it must have been notarized\" indicates that both conditions are required. Therefore, the inference \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" is simply a more concise way of expressing the same two conditions together. \n\nThus, the inference maintains the same meaning as the original statement, as it still requires both the signing and the notarization of the document. \n\nAnswer: yes",
