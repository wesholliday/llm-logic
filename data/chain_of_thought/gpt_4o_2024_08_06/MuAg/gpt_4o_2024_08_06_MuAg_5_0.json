            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for' from 'The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement is: 'The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for'. This statement is composed of two parts:\n1. 'The package must have been delivered today.'\n2. 'It must have been signed for.'\n\nThe conjunction 'and' connects these two parts, indicating that both conditions are true: the package was delivered today, and it was signed for.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is: 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for'. This statement also consists of two parts:\n1. 'The package must have been delivered today.'\n2. 'Signed for.'\n\nThe conjunction 'and' in this inferred statement also indicates that both conditions are true: the package was delivered today, and it was signed for.\n\nBoth the original statement and the inferred statement assert the same two conditions: delivery today and being signed for. The difference is only in the phrasing, not in the logical content. The original statement explicitly repeats 'must have been' for both conditions, while the inferred statement combines them into a single phrase. However, the meaning remains the same.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement logically follows from the original statement because both convey the same information about the delivery and signing of the package.\n\nAnswer: yes",
