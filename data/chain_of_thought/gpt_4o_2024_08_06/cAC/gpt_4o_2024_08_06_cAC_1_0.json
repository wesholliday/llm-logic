            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can conclude 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If M, then S,\" where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding,\" which is simply S.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If M, then S\" does not imply that M is true just because S is true. The truth of S does not provide any information about the truth of M. The conditional statement only tells us that if M were true, then S would also be true. However, S being true does not necessarily mean that M is true; M could be true or false independently of S being true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding,\" we cannot logically conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
