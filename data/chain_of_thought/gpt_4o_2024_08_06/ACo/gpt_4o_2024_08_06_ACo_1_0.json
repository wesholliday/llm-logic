            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Sue was at the wedding'. This is a straightforward assertion that Sue attended the wedding.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'If P, then Q', where P is 'Mary was at the wedding' and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' does not provide any information about the truth of P (the antecedent) on its own. It only tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, it does not imply that P is true just because Q is true.\n\nNow, let's consider what we have:\n\n- We know that Q ('Sue was at the wedding') is true from the first statement.\n- The conditional statement ('If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding') is also true.\n\nHowever, knowing that Q is true does not allow us to conclude that P is true. In logical terms, just because the consequent (Q) is true, it does not mean the antecedent (P) must be true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer that 'Mary was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: no",
