            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Lisa bought the red shirt' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which corresponds to Q being true.\n\nIn logic, from \"If P, then Q\" and Q being true, we cannot directly infer that P is true. This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Just because the consequence (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (P) must also be true. There could be other reasons or conditions under which Q could be true without P being true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
