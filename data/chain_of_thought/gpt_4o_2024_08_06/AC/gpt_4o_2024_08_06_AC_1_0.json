            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where M stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S stands for \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This means that if M is true, then S must also be true.\n\nThe second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \"S\" being true.\n\nWe need to determine if these two statements together allow us to conclude \"Mary was at the wedding\" (M).\n\nIn logic, from \"M \u2192 S\" and \"S\", we cannot directly infer \"M\". This is because the truth of S does not necessarily imply the truth of M. The conditional \"M \u2192 S\" only tells us what happens if M is true, not what happens if S is true. S could be true for reasons unrelated to M being true.\n\nFor example, it is possible that Sue was at the wedding for reasons other than Mary's presence. The conditional statement does not provide information about what happens if Sue is at the wedding independently of Mary.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
