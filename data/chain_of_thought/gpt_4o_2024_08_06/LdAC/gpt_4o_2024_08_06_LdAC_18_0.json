            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can logically deduce 'The doll was plastic' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The truck was metal,\" which corresponds to Q being true.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply that P is true just because Q is true. The truth of Q does not provide any information about the truth of P. The only thing we can deduce from \"If P, then Q\" and Q being true is that P could be true, but it is not necessarily true. There could be other reasons or conditions under which Q is true that do not involve P.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" and \"The truck was metal,\" we cannot logically deduce that \"The doll was plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
