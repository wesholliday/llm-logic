            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can logically deduce 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"M \u2192 S\", where \"M\" stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \"S\" stands for \"Sue was at the wedding\". This means that if Mary was at the wedding, then it necessarily follows that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\n2. The second statement is \"Sue was at the wedding\", which can be represented as \"S\".\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to conclude \"Mary was at the wedding\" (M).\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement \"M \u2192 S\" and the affirmation of the consequent \"S\", we cannot deduce the antecedent \"M\". This is a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\". Just because Sue was at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was also there. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Mary is at the wedding, not what happens if Sue is at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
