            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can logically deduce 'The book was written by James' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The book is a mystery novel,\" which corresponds to Q being true.\n\nIn logic, from \"If P, then Q\" and \"Q,\" we cannot deduce \"P.\" This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Just because Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P must be true. There could be other reasons or authors that could make the book a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
