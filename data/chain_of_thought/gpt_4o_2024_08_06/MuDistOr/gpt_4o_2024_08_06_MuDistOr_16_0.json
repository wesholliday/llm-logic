            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or the CEO.\" This statement uses the logical operator \"or,\" which in common usage can be inclusive or exclusive. However, in formal logic, \"or\" is typically interpreted as inclusive unless specified otherwise. This means that at least one of the conditions must be true, but it is also possible for both to be true.\n\nThe inference we are considering is \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO.\" This rephrasing explicitly separates the two possibilities, maintaining the inclusive nature of the \"or.\" It does not change the meaning of the original statement, as it still allows for the possibility that both the legal team and the CEO approved the contract.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid because it accurately reflects the inclusive \"or\" in the original statement, where at least one of the parties (the legal team or the CEO) must have approved the contract, and it does not exclude the possibility that both did.\n\nAnswer: yes",
