            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" presents two possibilities for the document: it could have been signed, or it could have been notarized, or it could have been both. The use of \"or\" in this context is inclusive, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true, but both could also be true.\n\nWhen we rephrase this to \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized,\" we are essentially restating the same inclusive condition. This rephrased statement also allows for the possibility that the document could have been both signed and notarized, as it does not exclude the possibility of both conditions being true.\n\nTherefore, the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Both statements convey that at least one of the conditions (signed or notarized) must be met, and they do not exclude the possibility of both being true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
