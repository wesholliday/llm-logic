            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply that if P is false, Q must also be false. The only situation where a conditional statement is false is when P is true and Q is false. If P is false, the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is considered true regardless of the truth value of Q.\n\nThe second statement given is \"The apple was not red,\" which means P is false. According to the rules of logic, when P is false, the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not provide any information about the truth value of Q. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of Q, which is \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nThus, from the given statements, we cannot conclude that \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
