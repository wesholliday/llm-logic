            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Joe did not go to the park,\" which is the negation of P, or \"not P.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not provide any information about what happens if P is false. The only thing it tells us is that if P is true, then Q must be true. However, if P is false, Q can be either true or false, and the conditional statement would still hold true. This is because a conditional statement is only false if P is true and Q is false.\n\nTherefore, from \"Joe did not go to the park\" (not P), we cannot infer anything about whether Lucy went to the zoo (Q) or not. The truth of Q is independent of the truth of P when P is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
