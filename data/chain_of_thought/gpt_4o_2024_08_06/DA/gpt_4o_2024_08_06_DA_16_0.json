            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The pants were not denim' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The shirt was not cotton,\" which is the negation of P, or \"not P.\"\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the negation of P (\"not P\"), we cannot directly infer the negation of Q (\"not Q\"). This is because the truth of Q is not dependent solely on P being true. The pants could still be denim for reasons unrelated to the shirt being cotton.\n\nThis logical principle is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a formal fallacy. Just because the antecedent (P) is false, it does not necessarily mean that the consequent (Q) is false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically infer that \"The pants were not denim.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
