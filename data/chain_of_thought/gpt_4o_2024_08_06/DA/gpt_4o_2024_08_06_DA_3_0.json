            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The book is not a mystery novel' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The book was not written by James,\" which is the negation of P, or \"not P.\"\n\nIn logic, from \"If P, then Q\" and \"not P,\" we cannot directly infer \"not Q.\" This is a logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if P is true; it does not provide information about what happens if P is false. Therefore, the fact that the book was not written by James does not allow us to conclude anything about whether the book is a mystery novel or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
