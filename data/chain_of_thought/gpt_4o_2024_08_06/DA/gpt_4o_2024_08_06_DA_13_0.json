            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The truck was not blue' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The car was not red,\" which is the negation of P, or \"not P.\"\n\nIn classical logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not provide any information about the truth value of Q if P is false. The only thing we can infer from \"If P, then Q\" and \"not P\" is that the conditional statement is vacuously true, meaning it holds true because the premise (P) is false, regardless of the truth value of Q.\n\nTherefore, from \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The car was not red,\" we cannot infer anything about the truth value of \"The truck was blue\" or \"The truck was not blue.\" The truck could be blue or not blue, and the given information does not allow us to determine which is the case.\n\nAnswer: no",
