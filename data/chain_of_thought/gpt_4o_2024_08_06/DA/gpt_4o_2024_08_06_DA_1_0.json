            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If M, then S\" (M \u2192 S).\n\n2. The second statement is \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this is represented as \"not M\" (\u00acM).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Sue was not at the wedding\" (\u00acS) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If M, then S\" (M \u2192 S) does not provide any information about what happens if M is false. The only thing it tells us is that if M is true, then S must also be true. However, if M is false, the conditional statement does not specify whether S is true or false. \n\nTherefore, from \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (\u00acM), we cannot conclude anything about whether Sue was at the wedding or not. The conditional statement does not cover the scenario where Mary is not at the wedding, so Sue could either be at the wedding or not, and we have no information to determine which is the case.\n\nAnswer: no",
