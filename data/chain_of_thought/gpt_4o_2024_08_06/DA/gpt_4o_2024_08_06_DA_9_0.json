            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which is the negation of P, or \"not P.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not provide any information about what happens if P is false. The only thing it tells us is that whenever P is true, Q must also be true. However, if P is false, Q can be either true or false, and the conditional statement would still hold true.\n\nTherefore, from \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" (not P), we cannot infer anything about whether Mark bought the blue shirt (Q) or not. The truth of Q is independent of the truth of P when P is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
