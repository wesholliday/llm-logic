            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical implications of each statement.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Sue might not have been at the wedding'. This implies that it is possible that Sue was not present at the wedding. However, it does not definitively state that Sue was absent; it only suggests the possibility of her absence.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding'. This is a conditional statement, which can be expressed in logical terms as: If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding). In logical terms, this is written as M \u2192 S.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If Mary was at the wedding (M is true), then according to the second statement, Sue must have been at the wedding (S is true).\n- The first statement suggests that Sue might not have been at the wedding, which means S could be false.\n\nTo infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', we need to show that M is false. The only way M can be false, given the conditional statement M \u2192 S, is if S is false. This is because if S is false, then M must also be false to satisfy the conditional (since if M were true, S would have to be true, which contradicts S being false).\n\nThe first statement 'Sue might not have been at the wedding' allows for the possibility that S is false. If we assume S is false, then M must also be false to satisfy the conditional M \u2192 S. Therefore, if we assume Sue was not at the wedding, it logically follows that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
