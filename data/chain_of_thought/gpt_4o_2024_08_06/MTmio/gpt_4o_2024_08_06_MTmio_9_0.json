            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt'. This implies that it is possible Mark did not buy the blue shirt. It does not definitively state that he did not buy it, only that there is a possibility he did not.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. This is a conditional statement. In logical terms, it can be expressed as: If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt). Symbolically, this is L \u2192 M.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- The statement 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt' suggests that there is a possibility that M is false (\u00acM).\n\n- From the conditional statement L \u2192 M, if L is true (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M must be true (Mark bought the blue shirt). However, if M is false (\u00acM), then L cannot be true, because if L were true, M would have to be true as well.\n\n- Therefore, if there is a possibility that M is false (as suggested by 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt'), then L must be false to avoid a contradiction with the conditional statement. This means Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nThus, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
