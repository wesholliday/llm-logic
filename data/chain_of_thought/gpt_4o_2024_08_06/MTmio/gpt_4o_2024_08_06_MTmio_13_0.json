            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The car was not red' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The truck might not have been blue.' This suggests that it is possible the truck was not blue, but it does not definitively state the truck was not blue. It leaves open the possibility that the truck was blue.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.' This is a conditional statement. In logical terms, it can be expressed as: If P (the car was red), then Q (the truck was blue).\n\nTo infer 'The car was not red,' we need to show that the assumption of the car being red leads to a contradiction with the given statements.\n\n- Assume the car was red (P is true). According to the second statement, if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue (Q is true).\n\n- However, the first statement 'The truck might not have been blue' suggests that it is possible for the truck not to be blue, which would contradict the conclusion that the truck must have been blue if the car was red.\n\nSince assuming the car was red leads to a contradiction with the possibility presented in the first statement, we can infer that the car was not red to avoid this contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
