            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The doll was not plastic' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The truck might not have been metal'. This implies that it is possible that the truck was not metal, but it does not definitively state that the truck was not metal. It leaves open the possibility that the truck was metal.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal'. This is a conditional statement. In logical terms, it can be expressed as: If P (the doll was plastic), then Q (the truck was metal).\n\nTo infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to show that the assumption of the doll being plastic leads to a contradiction with the given information.\n\n- Assume the doll was plastic (P is true). According to the second statement, if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal (Q is true).\n\n- However, the first statement 'The truck might not have been metal' suggests that it is possible for the truck to not be metal, which would contradict the conclusion that the truck must have been metal if the doll was plastic.\n\nSince assuming the doll was plastic leads to a contradiction with the possibility presented in the first statement, we can infer that the doll was not plastic to avoid this contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
