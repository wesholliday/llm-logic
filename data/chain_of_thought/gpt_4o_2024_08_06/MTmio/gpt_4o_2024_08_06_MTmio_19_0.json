            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'Jen might not have watched basketball'. This implies that it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball, but it does not definitively state that she did not watch it. It leaves open the possibility that she did watch basketball.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement, which can be expressed in logical terms as: If P (Tom watched football), then Q (Jen watched basketball).\n\nTo infer 'Tom did not watch football', we would need to use the contrapositive of the conditional statement. The contrapositive of 'If P, then Q' is 'If not Q, then not P'. In this context, it would be 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football'.\n\nHowever, the first statement 'Jen might not have watched basketball' does not definitively state that Jen did not watch basketball. It only suggests the possibility that she did not. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that 'not Q' (Jen did not watch basketball) is true. Without knowing for certain that Jen did not watch basketball, we cannot use the contrapositive to infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nThus, based on the information given, we cannot definitively infer that 'Tom did not watch football'.\n\nAnswer: no",
