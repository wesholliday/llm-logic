            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'The banana might not have been yellow'. This implies that it is possible for the banana to not be yellow. It does not definitively state that the banana was not yellow, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow'. This is a conditional statement, which can be written in the form 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the apple was red' and Q is 'the banana was yellow'.\n\nTo infer 'The apple was not red', we need to show that the negation of P (the apple was red) is true. This would be the case if the banana was not yellow, because according to the second statement, if the apple was red, the banana must have been yellow.\n\nThe first statement tells us that it is possible for the banana to not be yellow. If we assume the banana was not yellow, then according to the second statement, the apple could not have been red, because if it were red, the banana would have to be yellow, which contradicts our assumption that the banana was not yellow.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that the banana was not yellow allows us to conclude that the apple was not red, because if the apple were red, the banana would have to be yellow, which contradicts the possibility presented in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
