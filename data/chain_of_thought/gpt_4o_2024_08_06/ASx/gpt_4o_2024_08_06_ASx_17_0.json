However, the original statement does not provide any information about the condition C (\"the bloop is zorped\"). The presence of C does not affect the truth of B given A, according to the original statement.\n\nIn logical terms, the original statement guarantees that whenever A is true, B is true. It does not specify any conditions or dependencies on C. Therefore, the presence of C in the antecedent of the new statement does not change the truth of B, but it also does not allow us to infer the new statement directly from the original one without additional information.\n\nThus, without additional information linking C to the conclusion, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
