The truth of B is guaranteed only when A is true, regardless of any other conditions. Therefore, adding an extra condition (C) to the antecedent (A) does not affect the truth of the consequent (B) as long as A is true.\n\nThus, from \"If A, then B,\" we cannot infer \"If A and C, then B\" because the original statement does not account for the additional condition C. The presence of C could potentially affect the outcome, but we have no information about that from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
