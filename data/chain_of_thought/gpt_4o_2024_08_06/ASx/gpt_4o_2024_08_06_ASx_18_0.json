This is because if T is sufficient for P, then adding an additional condition (B) does not negate the sufficiency of T for P. The presence of B does not change the fact that T alone is enough to ensure P.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"If the zonk is twiddled and it is blorped, then it will pluzzle\" can indeed be inferred from \"If the zonk is twiddled, then it will pluzzle.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
