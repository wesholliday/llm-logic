The presence of R (the blarf is twinkling) does not affect the truth of the original conditional statement unless specified. The original statement does not provide any information about the condition of the blarf twinkling, so we cannot make any inference about it.\n\nTherefore, without additional information, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
