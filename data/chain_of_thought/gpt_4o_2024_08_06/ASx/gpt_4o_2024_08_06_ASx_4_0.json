The original statement does not provide any information about the effect of being bazoogled on the condition of being tinking. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the additional condition R (being bazoogled) would still result in Q (being tinking) without additional information.\n\nIn logical terms, the presence of an additional condition (R) in the antecedent (P and R) does not affect the truth of the consequent (Q) unless there is a specific relationship between R and Q that is stated or implied. Since no such relationship is provided, we cannot make the inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
