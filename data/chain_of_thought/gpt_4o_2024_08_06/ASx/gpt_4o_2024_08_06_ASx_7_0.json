It does not provide any information about the plink light or how it affects the goom being snurpled. Therefore, the presence or absence of the plink light (P) does not alter the original condition that whenever the tizzer is on, the goom is snurpled.\n\nIn logical terms, if T \u2192 G is true, then (T and P) \u2192 G is also true because the additional condition (P) does not negate the original condition (T) that leads to G. The presence of P is irrelevant to the truth of the implication T \u2192 G.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, the goom is still snurpled, as the original condition (T \u2192 G) is satisfied.\n\nAnswer: yes",
