The original statement does not provide any information about the condition R (\"the snarp is flooping\"). Therefore, the truth of Q (\"it is flugged\") is solely dependent on P (\"the fribble is in the snarp\") and not on whether R is true or false.\n\nThus, the presence of the additional condition R does not affect the conclusion Q, as long as P is true. Therefore, the statement \"If the fribble is in the snarp and the snarp is flooping, then it is flugged\" can indeed be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
