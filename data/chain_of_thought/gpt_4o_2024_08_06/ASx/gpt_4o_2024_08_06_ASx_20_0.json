However, the original statement only tells us that if P is true, then W is true. It does not provide any information about the condition D (the drazzle being drooped). \n\nIn logical terms, the original statement does not imply anything about the condition D. Therefore, we cannot infer that the presence of both P and D will necessarily lead to W, because the original statement does not address the impact of D at all. The presence of D is an additional condition that is not covered by the original statement.\n\nThus, the inference is not valid because the original statement does not account for the additional condition introduced in the inferred statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
