The presence of C (the crungle being splooted) is an additional condition that is not accounted for in the original statement. Without knowing how C interacts with A or B, we cannot make this inference.\n\nTherefore, based solely on the information given in the original statement, we cannot infer the new statement because the additional condition (C) could potentially affect the outcome, and we have no information about its impact.\n\nAnswer: no",
