The original statement only guarantees that B will occur if A is true, regardless of any other conditions like C. Therefore, the presence of C does not affect the truth of B as per the original statement, but it also does not allow us to infer the new statement with certainty.\n\nThus, the inference is not valid because the original statement does not provide any information about the effect of the additional condition C on the outcome B.\n\nAnswer: no",
