            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and Q is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The sprocket was not daggled,\" which can be represented as \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, from \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" we can infer \"not P.\" This form of reasoning is known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that allows us to conclude the negation of the antecedent (P) if we know the consequent (Q) is false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. If the sprocket was cranked (P), then the sprocket was daggled (Q).\n2. The sprocket was not daggled (not Q).\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n3. The sprocket was not cranked (not P).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
