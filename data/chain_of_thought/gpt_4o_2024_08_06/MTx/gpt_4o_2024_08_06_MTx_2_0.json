            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was flooped\" and Q is \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The wug did not bim the zoint,\" which can be represented as \"not Q.\"\n\nWe are asked to determine if we can infer \"The wug was not flooped,\" which is \"not P.\"\n\nIn logic, the rule of inference known as \"modus tollens\" allows us to conclude \"not P\" from \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q.\" Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. \"If P, then Q\" is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n2. \"not Q\" is \"The wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nFrom these, we can infer \"not P,\" which is \"The wug was not flooped.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
