            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The grommet was not sploffed' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n\n- If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n\nwhere P is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nThe second statement is: \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\" In logical terms, this is:\n\n- Not Q (\u00acQ)\n\nWe are asked to infer whether \"The grommet was not sploffed\" is true, which is:\n\n- Not P (\u00acP)\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP) through a rule called \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as:\n\n- If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n\n1. P \u2192 Q: If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n2. \u00acQ: The grommet did not plop the frink.\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n\n3. \u00acP: The grommet was not sploffed.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
