            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n\n- If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n\nwhere P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nThe second statement is: \"The sneg did not sproted the frink.\" In logical terms, this is:\n\n- Not Q (\u00acQ)\n\nWe are asked to infer whether \"The sneg was not crampled\" (\u00acP) is true.\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP) through a rule called \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens states that if \"If P then Q\" is true, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n\n1. If P \u2192 Q (If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink)\n2. \u00acQ (The sneg did not sproted the frink)\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n\n3. \u00acP (The sneg was not crampled)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
