            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided.\n\n1. The first statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Here, P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q is \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"The whiffle did not tink.\" In logical terms, this is:\n   - Not Q (\u00acQ)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\" from these statements. In logical terms, this is:\n   - Not P (\u00acP)\n\nThe logical rule that applies here is known as \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens states that if you have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), you can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n- We have P \u2192 Q (\"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\").\n- We also have \u00acQ (\"The whiffle did not tink\").\n\nAccording to modus tollens, from P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, we can infer \u00acP (\"The whiffle was not shanked\").\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
