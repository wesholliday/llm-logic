            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The splat was not morphed' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The splat did not quank,\" which is the negation of Q, or \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know \"not Q\" (Q is false), we can use a rule called \"modus tollens\" to infer \"not P\" (P is false). Modus tollens is a valid form of argument and can be summarized as:\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. If the splat was morphed (P), then the splat quanked (Q).\n2. The splat did not quank (not Q).\n3. Therefore, the splat was not morphed (not P).\n\nThus, based on the given information and the logical rule of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
