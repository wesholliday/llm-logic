            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The dreb was not spened,\" which can be represented as \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the negation of the consequent \"not Q,\" we can infer the negation of the antecedent \"not P.\" This form of reasoning is known as \"modus tollens.\"\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n1. If P (the dreb was vroombed), then Q (the dreb was spened).\n2. Not Q (the dreb was not spened).\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n3. Not P (the dreb was not vroombed).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
