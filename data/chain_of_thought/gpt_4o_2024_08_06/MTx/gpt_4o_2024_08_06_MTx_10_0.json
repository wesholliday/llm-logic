            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The wug was not sproinged' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"the wug was garpled.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The wug was not garpled,\" which can be represented as \"not Q.\"\n\nIn logic, from \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q,\" we can infer \"not P.\" This is known as the contrapositive reasoning or modus tollens. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" and \"The wug was not garpled,\" we can infer \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
