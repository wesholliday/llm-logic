            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled'. This can be interpreted as the negation of a necessity: \u00ac\u25a1D, where D stands for 'the sprocket was daggled'. This means that it is not necessarily true that the sprocket was daggled.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled'. This is a conditional statement: C \u2192 \u25a1D, where C stands for 'the sprocket was cranked'.\n\nWe are asked if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked', which is \u00acC.\n\nTo infer \u00acC from the given statements, we can use a form of reasoning called modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that allows us to infer the negation of the antecedent of a conditional statement if we know the negation of the consequent. The form is:\n\nIf P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\nIn our case, the conditional statement is C \u2192 \u25a1D. We have \u00ac\u25a1D from the first statement. Applying modus tollens:\n\n- C \u2192 \u25a1D (If the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled)\n- \u00ac\u25a1D (It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled)\n\nFrom these, we can infer \u00acC (The sprocket was not cranked).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the statements and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
