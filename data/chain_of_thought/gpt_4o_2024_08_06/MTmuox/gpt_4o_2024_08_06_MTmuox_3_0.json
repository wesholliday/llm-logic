            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The splat was not morphed' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is 'It's not the case that the splat must have quanked'. This can be interpreted as the negation of 'The splat must have quanked', which means 'The splat did not necessarily quank'.\n\n2. The second statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked'. This is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical terms as 'If M, then Q', where M represents 'The splat was morphed' and Q represents 'The splat must have quanked'.\n\nTo infer 'The splat was not morphed', we need to show that M is false. We have the negation of Q from the first statement, which is 'It's not the case that the splat must have quanked'. In logical terms, this is equivalent to 'Not Q'.\n\nIn classical logic, if we have 'If M, then Q' and 'Not Q', we can use a rule called modus tollens to infer 'Not M'. Modus tollens states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false.\n\nApplying modus tollens here:\n- We have 'If M, then Q' (If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked).\n- We also have 'Not Q' (It's not the case that the splat must have quanked).\n\nFrom these, we can infer 'Not M' (The splat was not morphed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
