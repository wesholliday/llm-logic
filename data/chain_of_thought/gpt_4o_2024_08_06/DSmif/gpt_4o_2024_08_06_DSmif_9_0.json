            "content": "Explanation: The problem presents us with a logical structure known as a disjunction, which is an \"either/or\" statement. The statement \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box\" can be represented in logical terms as \"A or B\", where A is \"the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor\" and B is \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box\".\n\nIn logic, a disjunction (A or B) is true if at least one of the components (A or B) is true. The only time a disjunction is false is if both components are false. \n\nThe second statement given is \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\", which is the negation of A, or \"not A\". \n\nWhen we have a disjunction \"A or B\" and we know \"not A\" (A is false), the only way for the disjunction to still hold true is if B is true. This is because if A is false and the disjunction is true, B must be true to satisfy the \"either/or\" condition.\n\nTherefore, given the statements:\n1. \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box\" (A or B)\n2. \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\" (not A)\n\nWe can logically infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\" (B).\n\nAnswer: yes",
