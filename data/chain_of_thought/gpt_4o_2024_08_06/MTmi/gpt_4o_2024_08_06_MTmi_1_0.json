            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This suggests that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding. In logical terms, this can be represented as:\n   - Not necessarily S (Sue was not necessarily at the wedding).\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there. This means that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary could not have been at the wedding. This is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n- The second statement tells us that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding. This does not definitively tell us that Sue was not there, only that it is a possibility.\n\n- However, if we assume that Sue was indeed not at the wedding (which is a possibility according to the second statement), then based on the contrapositive of the first statement, Mary could not have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, given the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
