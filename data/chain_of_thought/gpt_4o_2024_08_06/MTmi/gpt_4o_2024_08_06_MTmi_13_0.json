            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck might not have been blue.\" This suggests that it is possible that the truck was not blue. In logical terms, this can be interpreted as:\n   - Not necessarily Q (\u00acQ is possible).\n\nNow, let's consider what we are trying to infer: \"The car was not red.\" In logical terms, this is \u00acP.\n\nTo determine if we can infer \u00acP from the given statements, we need to consider the implications of the conditional statement and the possibility introduced by the second statement.\n\n- The conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) tells us that if the car was red (P), then the truck must have been blue (Q). This means that if the truck is not blue (\u00acQ), then the car cannot be red (\u00acP). This is a logical rule known as modus tollens: if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\n- The second statement, \"The truck might not have been blue,\" introduces the possibility that \u00acQ is true. If \u00acQ is indeed true, then by modus tollens, we can conclude \u00acP, which means \"The car was not red.\"\n\nTherefore, given the possibility that the truck might not have been blue, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
