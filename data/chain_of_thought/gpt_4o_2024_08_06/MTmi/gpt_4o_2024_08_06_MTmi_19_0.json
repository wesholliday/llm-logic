            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This statement suggests that it is possible that Q is false, but it does not definitively state that Q is false. In logical terms, this means that Q is not necessarily true.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the second statement \"Jen might not have watched basketball\" does not provide us with a definitive \"not Q\" (i.e., \"Jen did not watch basketball\"). It only suggests the possibility that Q is false, which is not sufficient to conclude \"not P\" (i.e., \"Tom did not watch football\") with certainty.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot definitively infer that \"Tom did not watch football\" because the second statement does not confirm that Jen did not watch basketball; it only suggests a possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
