            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The doll was not plastic' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - P \u2192 M\n   - Where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and M is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck might not have been metal.\" This suggests that it is possible that the truck was not metal, which can be represented as:\n   - \u00acM (not M) is possible.\n\nTo infer 'The doll was not plastic' (\u00acP), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- The conditional statement (P \u2192 M) tells us that if P is true, then M must be true. \n- The second statement suggests that M might not be true (\u00acM is possible).\n\nFor \u00acM to be possible, P must be false because if P were true, M would have to be true (due to the conditional statement). Therefore, the possibility of \u00acM implies that P cannot be true, otherwise, it would contradict the conditional statement.\n\nThus, the possibility that the truck might not have been metal (\u00acM is possible) allows us to infer that the doll was not plastic (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
