            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements provided.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\" In logical terms, this can be expressed as: \n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book might not be a mystery novel.\" This suggests that it is possible that the book is not a mystery novel, which can be interpreted as \"not necessarily Q\" or \"possibly not Q.\"\n\nTo infer whether \"The book was not written by James\" (not P), we need to consider the implications of the statements:\n\n- The conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) tells us that if P is true, then Q must be true. If Q is not true, then P cannot be true, because the truth of P guarantees the truth of Q.\n\n- The second statement introduces uncertainty about Q, suggesting that Q might not be true. If Q is not true, then according to the conditional statement, P cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, if there is a possibility that Q is not true (the book might not be a mystery novel), then P (the book was written by James) cannot be true, because if P were true, Q would have to be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
