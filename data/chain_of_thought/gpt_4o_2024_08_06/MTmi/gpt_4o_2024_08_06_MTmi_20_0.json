            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as \"If A, then B,\" where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nThe second statement is \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This suggests that it is possible that the banana was not yellow, which means that B might not be true.\n\nIn logic, if we have \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is not necessarily true (i.e., B might not be true), we can infer that A cannot be true. This is because if A were true, then B would have to be true (as per the conditional statement), but since B might not be true, A must not be true.\n\nTherefore, from the possibility that the banana was not yellow, we can infer that the apple was not red. This is a classic case of reasoning by contraposition in logic: if \"If A, then B\" is true, and B is not true, then A must not be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
