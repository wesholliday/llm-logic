            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this can be represented as: \n   - If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n   - Symbolically, this is: L \u2192 M.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This suggests that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. In logical terms, this means:\n   - It is not necessarily true that M is true.\n   - Symbolically, this can be represented as: \u00acM (not M is possible).\n\nNow, let's consider what we can infer from these statements:\n\n- From the first statement (L \u2192 M), we know that if L is true, then M must be true. This means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n- The second statement (\u00acM) suggests that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then according to the first statement, Lisa could not have bought the red shirt. This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, which contradicts the possibility that he did not.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt (\u00acM) implies that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acL). This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, which is not necessarily the case according to the second statement.\n\nThus, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
