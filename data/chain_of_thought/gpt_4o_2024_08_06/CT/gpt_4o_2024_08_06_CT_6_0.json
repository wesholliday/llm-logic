            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta\". \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\", which means \"If not Q, then not P\". The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\". This is exactly what we are asked to infer.\n\nTherefore, based on the rules of logical equivalence, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
