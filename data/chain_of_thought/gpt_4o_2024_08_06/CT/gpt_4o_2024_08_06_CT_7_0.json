            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"A \u2192 C\", where A is \"Alex finished the race\" and C is \"Chris finished the race\". \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"A \u2192 C\" is \"\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA\", which means \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\". The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\", we can indeed infer its contrapositive \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
