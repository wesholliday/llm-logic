            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" from the original statement. This new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is represented as \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, from the original statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball,\" we can indeed infer the contrapositive \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
