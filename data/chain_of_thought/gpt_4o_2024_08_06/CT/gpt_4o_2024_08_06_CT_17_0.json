The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" is \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\" This is exactly the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta\" from \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
