            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
