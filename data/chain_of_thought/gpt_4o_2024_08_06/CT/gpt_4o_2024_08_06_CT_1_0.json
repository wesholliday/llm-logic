            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe inference we are asked to consider is \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nThis type of inference is known as the contrapositive. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement \"If P, then Q\" is true, then the contrapositive \"If not Q, then not P\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" we can indeed infer the contrapositive \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
