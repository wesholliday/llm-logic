            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside' can be represented in logical terms as 'D \u2192 C', where 'D' stands for 'the dog was inside' and 'C' stands for 'the cat was outside'. This is a conditional statement.\n\nThe statement we want to infer is 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside', which can be represented as '\u00acC \u2192 \u00acD', where '\u00acC' stands for 'the cat was not outside' and '\u00acD' stands for 'the dog was not inside'.\n\nIn logic, the statement '\u00acC \u2192 \u00acD' is known as the contrapositive of the original statement 'D \u2192 C'. In classical logic, a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside', we can indeed infer 'If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
