            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
