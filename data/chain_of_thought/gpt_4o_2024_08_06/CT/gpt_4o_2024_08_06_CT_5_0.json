            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" from the original statement. This is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).\n\nIn logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always equivalent, meaning if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, from the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis,\" we can indeed infer \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
