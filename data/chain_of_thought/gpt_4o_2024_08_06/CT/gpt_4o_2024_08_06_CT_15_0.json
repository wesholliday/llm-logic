            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"P \u2192 Q\", where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin took a train\". \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"P \u2192 Q\" is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\", which means \"If not Q, then not P\". The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\". This is because:\n- The original statement is \"P \u2192 Q\" (\"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\").\n- The contrapositive is \"\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\" (\"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\").\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
