            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake' from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', we need to analyze the logical structure of these statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' can be represented in logical terms as 'V \u2192 M', where 'V' stands for 'the vampire was awake' and 'M' stands for 'the mummy was awake'. This is a conditional statement.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake', can be represented as '\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV', where '\u00ac' denotes 'not'.\n\nIn logic, the statement '\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV' is known as the contrapositive of the original statement 'V \u2192 M'. In classical logic, a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', we can indeed infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake', because they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
