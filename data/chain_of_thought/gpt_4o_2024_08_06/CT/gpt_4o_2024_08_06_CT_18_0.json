            "content": "Explanation: To determine whether we can infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as 'P \u2192 Q', where 'P' is 'the doll was plastic' and 'Q' is 'the truck was metal'.\n\nThe statement we want to infer, 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic', is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'P \u2192 Q' is '\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP', where '\u00acQ' is 'the truck was not metal' and '\u00acP' is 'the doll was not plastic'.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if we accept the original statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' as true, we can infer the contrapositive 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic' as true as well.\n\nAnswer: yes",
