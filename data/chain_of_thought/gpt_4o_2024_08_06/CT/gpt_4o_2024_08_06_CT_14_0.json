            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nThe statement we are asked to infer, \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave,\" is the contrapositive of the original statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
