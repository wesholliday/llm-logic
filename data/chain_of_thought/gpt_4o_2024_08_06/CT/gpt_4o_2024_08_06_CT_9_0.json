            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement, which can be represented in logical terms as \"If P, then Q\", where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\". \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
