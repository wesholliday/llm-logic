The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\". Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer this statement from the original.\n\nAnswer: yes",
