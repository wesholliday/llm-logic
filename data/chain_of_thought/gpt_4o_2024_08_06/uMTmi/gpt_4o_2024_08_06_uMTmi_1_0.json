            "content": "Explanation: \nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the logical implications of the statements given.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented logically as: \n   - If M (Mary was at the wedding), then S (Sue was at the wedding).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\" This suggests that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding, which can be represented as:\n   - Not S (Sue was not at the wedding) is possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- From the first statement, if Mary was at the wedding (M is true), then Sue must have been at the wedding (S must be true). \n\n- However, the second statement introduces the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding (Not S is possible). \n\n- If Not S is possible, then S is not necessarily true. \n\n- If S is not necessarily true, then M cannot be true because if M were true, S would have to be true (based on the first statement).\n\nTherefore, the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding (Not S) implies that Mary could not have been at the wedding (Not M), because if Mary were at the wedding, Sue would have to be there as well, which contradicts the possibility of Not S.\n\nThus, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
