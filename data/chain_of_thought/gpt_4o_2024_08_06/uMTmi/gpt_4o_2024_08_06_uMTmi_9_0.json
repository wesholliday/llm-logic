            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the statements and analyze them logically.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as: \n   - If L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then M (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\" This implies that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, which can be represented as:\n   - Not necessarily M (Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt).\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- From the first statement, if Lisa bought the red shirt (L is true), then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (M is true). This is a direct implication of the conditional statement.\n\n- The second statement introduces the possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then according to the first statement, Lisa could not have bought the red shirt. This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would have had to buy the blue shirt, which contradicts the possibility that he did not.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt implies that the condition for him buying it (Lisa buying the red shirt) was not met. Hence, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
