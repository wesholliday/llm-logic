            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - If T (Tom watched football), then J (Jen watched basketball).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This implies that it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball. In logical terms, this means:\n   - It is possible that not J (Jen did not watch basketball).\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that if Tom watched football (T), then Jen must have watched basketball (J). This means that if Jen did not watch basketball (not J), then Tom could not have watched football (not T). This is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n- The second statement tells us that it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball (not J). If this possibility is true (not J), then based on the contrapositive of the first statement, Tom did not watch football (not T).\n\nTherefore, given that it is possible for Jen not to have watched basketball, we can infer that Tom did not watch football, because if he had, Jen would have had to watch basketball, which contradicts the possibility that she did not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
