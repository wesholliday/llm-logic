            "content": "Explanation: \nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and determine if they logically lead to the conclusion.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as: \n   - If P (doll is plastic), then Q (truck is metal).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck might not have been metal.\" This implies that it is possible that the truck was not metal, which can be represented as:\n   - Not necessarily Q (truck is not necessarily metal).\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nLet's analyze the logic:\n\n- The first statement tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. This means that the only way for the truck to not be metal is if the doll is not plastic. \n\n- The second statement suggests that the truck might not be metal. This possibility aligns with the scenario where the doll is not plastic, because if the doll were plastic, the truck would have to be metal (according to the first statement).\n\nTherefore, the possibility that the truck is not metal supports the conclusion that the doll is not plastic. If the doll were plastic, the truck would have to be metal, contradicting the possibility that the truck might not be metal.\n\nThus, based on the given statements, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
