            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - If V (vampire is awake), then M (mummy is awake). \n   - In logical notation, this is: V \u2192 M.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The mummy might not have been awake.\" This suggests that it is possible for the mummy to not be awake. In logical terms, this means that \u00acM (not M) is possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- From the first statement (V \u2192 M), if the vampire is awake (V is true), then the mummy must be awake (M is true). If the mummy is not awake (\u00acM is true), then the vampire cannot be awake because that would contradict the first statement. \n\n- The second statement tells us that it is possible for the mummy to not be awake (\u00acM is possible). If \u00acM is possible, then according to the first statement, V cannot be true because if V were true, M would have to be true, which contradicts the possibility of \u00acM.\n\nTherefore, the possibility of the mummy not being awake (\u00acM) implies that the vampire was not awake (\u00acV), because if the vampire were awake, the mummy would have to be awake, which contradicts the possibility of the mummy not being awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
