            "content": "Explanation: Let's break down the given statements and analyze them logically.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - If Car is Red (C), then Truck is Blue (T). \n   - Symbolically, this is: C \u2192 T.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck might not have been blue.\" This suggests that it is possible for the truck to not be blue. In logical terms, this means:\n   - It is possible that not T (\u00acT).\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- From the first statement (C \u2192 T), if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. This means that if the truck is not blue (\u00acT), then the car cannot be red. This is the contrapositive of the first statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. So, \u00acT \u2192 \u00acC.\n\n- The second statement tells us that it is possible for the truck to not be blue (\u00acT is possible). If \u00acT is indeed the case, then according to the contrapositive (\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC), the car cannot be red.\n\nTherefore, given that the truck might not have been blue, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
