            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and their logical implications.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\" This can be represented in logical terms as: \n   - If P (Sam took a plane), then Q (Erin took a train).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Erin might not have taken a train.\" This implies that it is possible that Q is false (\u00acQ).\n\nNow, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If Erin might not have taken a train (\u00acQ is possible), then according to the first statement, Sam could not have taken a plane. This is because if Sam had taken a plane (P), then Erin must have taken a train (Q) due to the conditional relationship. Since \u00acQ is possible, P must be false to avoid a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that Erin did not take a train (\u00acQ) directly implies that Sam did not take a plane (\u00acP), because if Sam had taken a plane, Erin taking a train would be a necessity, not just a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
