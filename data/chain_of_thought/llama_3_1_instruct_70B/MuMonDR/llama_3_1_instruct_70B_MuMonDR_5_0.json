            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today' from 'The package must have been delivered today', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The package must have been delivered today' implies that the delivery occurred on the current day. The statement 'The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today' includes the possibility of delivery on the current day, but also adds the possibility of delivery on the next day (tomorrow). Since 'tomorrow' is not included in the original statement, we cannot directly infer the new statement from the original one. However, the original statement does imply that the package was delivered on the current day, which is one of the possibilities in the new statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
