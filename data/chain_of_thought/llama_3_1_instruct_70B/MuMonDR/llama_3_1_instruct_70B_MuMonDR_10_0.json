            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been notarized or signed' from 'The document must have been signed', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The document must have been signed' implies that signing is a necessary condition for the document. The inferred statement 'The document must have been notarized or signed' suggests that either notarization or signing is a necessary condition. Since signing is a part of the 'notarized or signed' condition, the inferred statement is actually less restrictive than the original statement. However, the original statement does not provide any information about notarization, so we cannot directly infer that notarization is a necessary condition. But since signing is a part of the 'notarized or signed' condition, and the original statement already states that the document must have been signed, we can say that the document must have been notarized or signed, because it must have been signed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
