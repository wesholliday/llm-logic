            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays' from 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays', we need to analyze the given statement. The original statement explicitly states that the restaurant 'must have been closed on Mondays'. This implies that the restaurant was indeed closed on Mondays, but it does not provide any information about the restaurant's hours on other days. However, the statement 'The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays' includes the possibility of the restaurant being closed on Mondays, which aligns with the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
