            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The room must have been cleaned daily' implies a regular and consistent cleaning schedule, specifically on a daily basis. The phrase 'upon request or daily' suggests two possible cleaning schedules: either the room is cleaned daily, or it is cleaned when requested. Since 'daily' is a subset of 'upon request or daily', we can infer that if the room must have been cleaned daily, it also satisfies the condition of being cleaned upon request or daily.\n\nAnswer: yes",
