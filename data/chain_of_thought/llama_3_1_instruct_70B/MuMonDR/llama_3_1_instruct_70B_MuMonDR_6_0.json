            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have been postponed or sold out' from 'The concert must have been sold out', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The concert must have been sold out' implies that the concert was fully booked and no more tickets were available. The statement 'The concert must have been postponed or sold out' presents two possible scenarios: either the concert was postponed or it was sold out. Since 'The concert must have been sold out' is one of the two possibilities presented in the second statement, we can infer that the second statement is true if the first statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
