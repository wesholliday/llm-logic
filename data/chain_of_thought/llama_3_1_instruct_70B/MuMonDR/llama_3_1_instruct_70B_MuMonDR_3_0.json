            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The keys must be on the table or in the drawer' from 'The keys must be in the drawer', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The keys must be in the drawer' is a specific assertion about the location of the keys. The statement 'The keys must be on the table or in the drawer' is a more general statement that includes the original location (in the drawer) and adds an alternative location (on the table).\n\nSince the original statement only mentions the keys being in the drawer, we cannot logically infer that they could also be on the table. However, we can say that if the keys must be in the drawer, then it is also true that they must be either on the table or in the drawer, because 'in the drawer' is a subset of the possibilities 'on the table or in the drawer'. This is a process of adding a disjunct (an 'or' option) to the original statement, which does not change the truth of the original statement but does make the new statement true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
