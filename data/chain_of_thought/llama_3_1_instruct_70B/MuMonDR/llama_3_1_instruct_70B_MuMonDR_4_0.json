            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM' implies a specific time for the meeting. The inferred statement 'The meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM' introduces an additional possibility (the meeting being cancelled) that is not present in the original statement. However, the original statement does not provide any information about the meeting being cancelled, so we cannot directly infer the cancellation part. But we can infer that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM, and since the meeting being cancelled is an alternative to it being scheduled, we can consider the disjunction (or) of these two possibilities as a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
