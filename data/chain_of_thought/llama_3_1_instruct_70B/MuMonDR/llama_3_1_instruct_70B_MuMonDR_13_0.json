The original statement 'The movie must have been in English' implies that the movie was in the English language. The inferred statement 'The movie must have been subtitled or in English' includes the possibility of the movie being in English, which aligns with the original statement. However, it also includes the possibility of the movie being subtitled, which is not explicitly mentioned in the original statement. Since the original statement does not provide any information about subtitles, we can only confirm the 'in English' part of the inferred statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
