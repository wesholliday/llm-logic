            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The event must have been semi-formal or formal' from 'The event must have been formal', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The event must have been formal' implies that the event was definitely formal, with no room for other possibilities. The inferred statement 'The event must have been semi-formal or formal' includes both semi-formal and formal possibilities. Since 'formal' is a subset of 'semi-formal or formal', and we know the event was formal, it is also true that it was either semi-formal or formal. \n\nAnswer: yes",
