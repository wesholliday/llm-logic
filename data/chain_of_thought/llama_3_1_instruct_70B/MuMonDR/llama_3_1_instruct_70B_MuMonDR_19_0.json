            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The application must have been completed online' implies that the application can only be completed through an online method. It does not provide any information about the possibility of completing the application in person. However, it does not explicitly rule out the possibility of in-person completion either. The statement only specifies that the application 'must have been completed online', which means it is a requirement, but it does not necessarily exclude other methods. \n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer 'The application must have been completed in person or online'. The word 'must' in this statement implies that both in-person and online are the only options, and both are required. Since the original statement only specifies online completion as a requirement, we cannot infer that in-person completion is also a requirement.\n\nAnswer: no",
