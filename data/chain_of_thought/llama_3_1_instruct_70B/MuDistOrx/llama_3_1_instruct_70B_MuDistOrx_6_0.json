            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The blimp must gribble a flonk or gribble a wibble snorkel' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two alternatives. The word 'or' is used to connect the two alternatives, indicating that at least one of them must be true. The phrase 'The blimp must gribble' is common to both alternatives, and it is implied that the subject 'The blimp' is the same in both cases. \n\nWhen we rephrase the statement as 'The blimp must gribble a flonk or it must gribble a wibble snorkel', we are essentially using the pronoun 'it' to refer back to 'The blimp'. This rephrased statement maintains the same meaning as the original statement, as 'it' clearly refers to 'The blimp'. Therefore, the rephrased statement is a logical inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
