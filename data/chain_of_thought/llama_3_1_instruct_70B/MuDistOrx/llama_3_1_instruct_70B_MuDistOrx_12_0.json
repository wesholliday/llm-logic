            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The quibble must be floob on the froodle or be snork on the zump' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two alternatives. The phrase 'must be' is used before 'floob on the froodle', but not before 'snork on the zump'. However, the word 'be' is used before 'snork on the zump'. Since 'must be' and 'be' both imply a necessity or requirement, we can infer that the necessity applies to both alternatives. This is because the disjunction is presenting two options that are both required to be considered. Therefore, we can infer that the necessity of 'must be' applies to both 'floob on the froodle' and 'snork on the zump'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
