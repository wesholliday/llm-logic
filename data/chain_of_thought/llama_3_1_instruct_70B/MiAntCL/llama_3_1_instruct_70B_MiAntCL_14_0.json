The original statement only mentions the possibility of the contract being valid for a year, but it does not provide any information about the contract being renewable. The concept of renewability is not mentioned or implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the additional information about the contract being renewable from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
