The original statement only mentions the difficulty of the exam, but it does not provide any information about the scope or coverage of the exam. The inferred statement adds an additional piece of information, 'cover all chapters', which is not present in the original statement. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the exam's coverage, we cannot logically infer that the exam will cover all chapters.\n\nAnswer: no",
