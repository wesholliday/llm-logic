The original statement only provides information about the possible time of the meeting, which is 2 PM. It does not provide any information about the location of the meeting. \n\nIn order to infer 'The meeting might be at 2 PM and in the conference room', we would need additional information that links the meeting to the conference room. Since the original statement does not provide this information, we cannot make this inference based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
