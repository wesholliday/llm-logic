The original statement only mentions the report's accuracy, but it does not provide any information about the report's submission time. The statement we are trying to infer adds an additional condition (being submitted by noon) that is not present in the original statement. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the submission time, we cannot logically infer the additional condition.\n\nAnswer: no",
