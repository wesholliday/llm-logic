            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package might be delivered today and signed for' from 'The package might be delivered today', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement only mentions the possibility of the package being delivered today, but it does not provide any information about the package being signed for. Signing for a package is an additional action that may or may not occur during delivery. Since the original statement does not guarantee or imply that the package will be signed for, we cannot infer the additional action of signing for the package.\n\nAnswer: no",
