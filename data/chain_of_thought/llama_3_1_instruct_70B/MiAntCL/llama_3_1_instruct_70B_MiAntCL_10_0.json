            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document might be signed and notarized' from 'The document might be signed', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The document might be signed' only mentions the possibility of the document being signed, but it does not provide any information about notarization. Notarization is an additional step that may or may not occur after signing. Since the original statement does not guarantee or imply notarization, we cannot directly infer that the document might be both signed and notarized.\n\nAnswer: no",
