            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat did not quank', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The splat was not morphed'. The second statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the splat was morphed' and B is 'the splat quanked'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is false, we cannot determine the truth value of the conclusion (B). However, in this case, we are given that the condition (A) is false, as stated in the first statement 'The splat was not morphed'. \n\nSince the condition is false, we cannot directly infer the truth value of the conclusion 'the splat quanked'. However, we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement, which is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive of the given conditional statement would be 'If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed'. \n\nGiven that we know 'The splat was not morphed', we can use the contrapositive to infer that 'If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed'. Since we know 'The splat was not morphed', we can conclude that 'The splat did not quank' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
