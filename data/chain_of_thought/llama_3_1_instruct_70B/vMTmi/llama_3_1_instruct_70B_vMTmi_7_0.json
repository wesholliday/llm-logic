            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement: 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race'. This can be represented as 'A \u2192 C', where A is 'Alex finished the race' and C is 'Chris finished the race'. The second premise is 'Chris might not have finished the race', which can be represented as '\u00acC' (not C) or more accurately '\u00acC \u2228 C' (not C or C), but for the purpose of this argument, we can consider it as '\u00acC'. The conclusion is 'Alex did not finish the race', which can be represented as '\u00acA'.\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument. If the first premise is true, then if Alex finished the race (A), Chris must have finished the race (C). However, the second premise states that Chris might not have finished the race (\u00acC). This creates a contradiction with the first premise if we assume Alex finished the race. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race (\u00acA).\n\nThis type of argument is called 'modus tollens', which is a valid form of argument in logic. The modus tollens rule states that if 'A \u2192 C' and '\u00acC', then '\u00acA'. Since the argument follows this rule, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
