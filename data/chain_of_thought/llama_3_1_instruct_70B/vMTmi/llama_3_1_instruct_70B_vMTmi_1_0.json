            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B is \"Sue must have been at the wedding\"). The second premise is \"Sue might not have been at the wedding,\" which can be represented as \"Possibly not B.\" \n\nThe conclusion is \"Mary was not at the wedding,\" which is the negation of A. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. \n\nIn this case, the argument is trying to use a form of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form: \"If A, then B; Not B; Therefore, Not A.\" However, the second premise \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" is not the same as \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" is a possibility, not a certainty. \n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because it is trying to use a modus tollens form with a premise that does not provide the necessary certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
