            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be broken down into the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim)\n2. Not necessarily Q (The pants might not have been denim)\n3. Therefore, not P (The shirt was not cotton)\n\nThis form of argument is known as the \"denying the consequent\" or \"modus tollens\" when the second premise is a negation of the consequent (Q). However, in this case, the second premise is not a negation of the consequent, but rather a statement of possibility (might not have been). \n\nA logically valid form of argument would be:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, not P\n\nSince the second premise in the given argument is \"The pants might not have been denim\" (which is not a negation of the consequent), the argument does not follow the logically valid form of modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: no",
