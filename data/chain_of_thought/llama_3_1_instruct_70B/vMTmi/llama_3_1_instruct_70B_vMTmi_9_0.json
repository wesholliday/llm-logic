            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement: 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. This can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B is 'Mark must have bought the blue shirt'. \n\nThe second premise is 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt', which can be represented as 'Not B' (or 'possibly not B', but for the purpose of this argument, we'll consider it as 'not B' since 'might not' implies a possibility of 'not B'). \n\nThe conclusion is 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', which can be represented as 'Not A'. \n\nNow, let's examine the argument form: If A, then B; Not B; therefore, Not A. This is a classic example of the modus tollens argument form, which is logically valid. Modus tollens states that if A implies B, and B is false, then A must be false. \n\nIn this case, if Lisa buying the red shirt implies Mark buying the blue shirt, and Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then we can logically conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
