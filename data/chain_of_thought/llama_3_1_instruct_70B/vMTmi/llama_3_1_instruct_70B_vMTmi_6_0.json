            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement: 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta'. This can be represented as 'P \u2192 Q', where P is 'Sue chose pizza' and Q is 'Bob must have chosen pasta'. The second premise is 'Bob might not have chosen pasta', which can be represented as '\u00acQ' (not Q) or more accurately '\u223cQ' (it is possible that not Q), but for the sake of this argument, we can consider it as '\u00acQ' for simplicity.\n\nThe conclusion is 'Sue did not choose pizza', which can be represented as '\u00acP'. \n\nA logically valid argument is one where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ). This is a classic example of the 'modus tollens' argument form, which is logically valid. The modus tollens form is: \n\nP \u2192 Q\n\u00acQ\n\u2234 \u00acP\n\nThis form is valid because if P implies Q, and Q is not true, then P cannot be true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
