This statement implies that if the whiffle was shanked, it must have tinked, but it does not provide any information about the converse situation. In other words, it does not guarantee that if the whiffle tinked, it was shanked. There could be other reasons why the whiffle tinked that are not related to it being shanked.\n\nAnswer: no",
