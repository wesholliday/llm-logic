This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the splat was morphed' and B is 'the splat quanked'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed', we need to check if the original statement implies its converse. The converse of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If B, then A'. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement only guarantees that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked. It does not provide any information about what happens if the splat quanked but was not morphed. There could be other reasons why the splat quanked, and the original statement does not rule out those possibilities.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
