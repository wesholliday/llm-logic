This statement implies that if the shank was plooked, it must have been nugged, but it does not provide any information about the converse situation. In other words, it does not guarantee that if the shank was nugged, it must have been plooked. There could be other reasons why the shank was nugged that are not related to it being plooked.\n\nAnswer: no",
