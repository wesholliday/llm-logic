This statement does not imply that the only way for the twonk to be varnished is for it to be plinked. It only states that if the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished, but it does not rule out the possibility of the twonk being varnished through other means. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked.\n\nAnswer: no",
