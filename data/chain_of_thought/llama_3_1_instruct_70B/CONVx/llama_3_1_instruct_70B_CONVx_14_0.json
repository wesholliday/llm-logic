This statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B is true. However, it does not provide any information about the converse, i.e., if B is true, then A is true. In other words, just because the clug snugged, it does not necessarily mean that the clug was fleeked. There could be other reasons why the clug snugged.\n\nAnswer: no",
