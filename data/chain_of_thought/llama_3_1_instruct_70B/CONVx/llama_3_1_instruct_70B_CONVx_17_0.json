This statement only guarantees that if A occurs, then B will occur, but it does not guarantee that if B occurs, then A must have occurred. In other words, it does not rule out the possibility that B can occur without A. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the flob movated, then the flob was skizzled' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
