This type of statement does not imply the converse, which is \"If B, then A\". In other words, just because being sproinged implies being garpled, it does not necessarily mean that being garpled implies being sproinged. There could be other reasons why the wug was garpled that are unrelated to being sproinged.\n\nAnswer: no",
