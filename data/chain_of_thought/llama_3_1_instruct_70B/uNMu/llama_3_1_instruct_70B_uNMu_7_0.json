This statement does not assert that Alex did not finish the race, but rather that it is not a requirement or a guaranteed outcome. However, it does leave room for the possibility that Alex might not have finished the race, as it does not rule out this option entirely. Therefore, we can infer that Alex might not have finished the race, as this possibility is not excluded by the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
