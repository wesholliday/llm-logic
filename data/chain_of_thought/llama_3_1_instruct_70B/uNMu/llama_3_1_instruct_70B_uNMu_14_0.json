            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter\" implies that there is no requirement or necessity for the milk to be on the counter. This means that the milk's location is not restricted to the counter, and it could potentially be elsewhere. However, it does not explicitly state that the milk is not on the counter, only that it doesn't have to be. Therefore, we can infer that the milk might not be on the counter, but we cannot be certain.\n\nAnswer: yes",
