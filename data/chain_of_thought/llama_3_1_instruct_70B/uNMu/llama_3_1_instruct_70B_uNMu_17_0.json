This statement does not provide any information about the actual location of the scarf, but it does indicate that it is not mandatory for the scarf to be in the backpack. \n\nGiven this information, we can infer that the scarf might not be stuffed in the backpack because there is no requirement for it to be there. However, it is also possible that the scarf is still in the backpack, but it's not a requirement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
