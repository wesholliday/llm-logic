This statement does not provide any information about the actual presence or absence of the griffin in the forest. It only negates the idea that the griffin's presence in the forest is a must or a requirement. \n\nHowever, the statement does not rule out the possibility of the griffin being in the forest. It simply means that the griffin's presence is not a necessity. Therefore, it is possible that the griffin might have been in the forest, and it is also possible that it might not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
