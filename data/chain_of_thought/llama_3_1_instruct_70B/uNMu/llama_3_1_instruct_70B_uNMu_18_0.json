            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer\" implies that there is no requirement or necessity for the notebook to be in the drawer. This means that the notebook's location is not fixed or determined to be in the drawer. However, it does not provide any information about the actual location of the notebook. It only tells us that it's not a must for the notebook to be in the drawer. \n\nThis statement leaves room for the possibility that the notebook might be in the drawer, but it's not a requirement. Therefore, we can also infer that the notebook might not be in the drawer, as there is no necessity for it to be there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
