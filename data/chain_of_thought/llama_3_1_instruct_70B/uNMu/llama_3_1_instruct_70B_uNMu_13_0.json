            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" implies that there is no requirement or necessity for the toy to be in the toy box. This means that the toy's location is not restricted to the toy box, and it could potentially be elsewhere. However, it does not provide any information about the toy's actual location. The phrase \"it's not the case that\" is a negation of a necessity, which leaves open the possibility that the toy could still be in the toy box, but it's not required to be there. Therefore, we can infer that the toy might not be in the toy box, but we cannot be certain.\n\nAnswer: yes",
