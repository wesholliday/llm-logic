The original statement is a conjunction of two conditions: 'The crunk must be zibble snizzle' and 'The crunk must be flimble at snorkel zibble'. \n\nIn a logical conjunction, both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true. However, if we remove one of the conditions, the resulting statement is still a part of the original statement. Therefore, we can infer 'The crunk must be flimble at snorkel zibble' from the original statement, as it is one of the conditions in the conjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
