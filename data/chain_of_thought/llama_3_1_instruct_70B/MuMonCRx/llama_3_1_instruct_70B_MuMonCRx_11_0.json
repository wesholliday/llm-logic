The statement 'The fizzle must be frazzle and wobble' implies that 'fizzle' has two necessary properties: 'frazzle' and 'wobble'. This means that 'fizzle' must have both 'frazzle' and 'wobble' to be true. \n\nSince 'wobble' is one of the necessary properties, we can conclude that 'The fizzle must be wobble' is indeed a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
