The statement 'The floob must be in fribble and fribble glorp' implies that the floob is a part of both 'fribble' and 'fribble glorp'. However, it does not explicitly state that the floob is equal to 'fribble glorp'. It only guarantees that the floob is a part of 'fribble glorp', but it could also be a part of 'fribble' without being equal to 'fribble glorp'. \n\nAnswer: no",
