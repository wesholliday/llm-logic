    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will\" can be broken down into a conditional statement: If (Georgia doesn't add the most jobs) then (if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will). This is a nested conditional statement. \n\nHowever, we also know that \"Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t.\" This implies that the condition \"Georgia doesn't add the most jobs\" is likely to be true. \n\nNow, if we consider the nested conditional statement, we see that the condition \"Georgia doesn't add the most jobs\" is likely to be true, but this does not necessarily make the entire conditional statement true. The conditional statement only guarantees that if the condition is true, then the nested conditional statement will be true. \n\nHowever, the nested conditional statement \"if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will\" is only true if the condition \"Georgia doesn't add the most jobs\" is true. Since we know that \"Tennessee likely will add the most jobs\", the condition \"Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs\" is unlikely to be true. \n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that it's likely that if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\nAnswer: no",
