    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information states that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, followed by solar power, and then wind power. It also states that if solar power doesn't generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn't, wind power will. This implies that wind power will only generate the most electricity if both tidal and solar power do not. However, since tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, the condition for wind power to generate the most electricity (i.e., both tidal and solar power not generating the most) is unlikely to occur. Therefore, even though the condition for wind power to generate the most electricity is met if tidal power doesn't, the initial likelihood of tidal power generating the most electricity makes it unlikely that the condition will be met.\n\nAnswer: no",
