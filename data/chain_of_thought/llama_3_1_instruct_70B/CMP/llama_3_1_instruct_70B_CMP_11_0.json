    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Ford, Toyota, and Honda lead US auto sales. Industry analysis expects Ford will sell the most vehicles this year, followed closely by Toyota, with Honda lagging significantly behind. These brands lead the market, so if Toyota isn\u2019t #1 in sales, then if Ford isn\u2019t, Honda will be. Moreover, Ford likely will lead in sales and hence Toyota likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Ford doesn\u2019t lead in sales, Honda will?",
    "system_prompt": "In response to the following question, think step by step and explain your reasoning, starting your response with 'Explanation: '; then *after* explaining your reasoning, when you are ready to answer, simply write 'Answer: ' followed by 'yes' or 'no' and nothing else. Please make sure to format your response by first explaining your reasoning and then writing 'Answer:' followed by 'yes' or 'no' at the very end.",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information states that if Toyota isn't #1 in sales, then if Ford isn't, Honda will be. This implies that if Ford isn't #1 and Toyota isn't #1, then Honda will be #1. However, the information also states that Ford likely will lead in sales, which means it is unlikely that Ford won't lead in sales. \n\nThe statement \"if Ford doesn't lead in sales, Honda will\" is a conditional statement that depends on the condition \"Ford doesn't lead in sales.\" Since it is unlikely that Ford won't lead in sales, the condition is unlikely to be met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it is likely that if Ford doesn't lead in sales, Honda will.\n\nAnswer: no",
