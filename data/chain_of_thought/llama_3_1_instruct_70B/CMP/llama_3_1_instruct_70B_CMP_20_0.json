    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": "Explanation: The given information states that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, and then soda. It also states that if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, and coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers. However, we are also told that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, which implies that tea is unlikely to retain the most morning drinkers. \n\nNow, we need to evaluate the statement: \"if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\" Given that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, the condition \"if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers\" is unlikely to occur. However, if this unlikely condition does occur, the original statement \"if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers\" still applies. Since tea is unlikely to retain the most morning drinkers (because coffee is likely to), the condition \"if tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers\" is likely to be true. Therefore, if the unlikely condition \"if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers\" occurs, it is likely that soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: yes",
