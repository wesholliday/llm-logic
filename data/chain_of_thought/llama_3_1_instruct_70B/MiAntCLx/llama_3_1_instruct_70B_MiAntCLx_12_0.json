The original statement only mentions the possibility of the flimble being grazzle by glorp, but it does not provide any information about the flimble being blimp quank. The addition of 'and be blimp quank' introduces new information that is not present in the original statement. \n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about the flimble being blimp quank, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
