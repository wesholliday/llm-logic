The original statement is 'The floob might be zooble on flibbit'. This statement provides information about the possibility of 'the floob' being 'zooble' under the condition of being 'on flibbit'. \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is 'The floob might be zooble on flibbit and snork flimble wibble'. This statement adds an additional condition 'snork flimble wibble' to the original statement. However, the original statement does not provide any information about 'snork flimble wibble'. \n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about 'snork flimble wibble', we cannot logically infer the additional condition from the original statement. The original statement only talks about the possibility of 'the floob' being 'zooble' on 'flibbit', but it does not provide any information about 'snork flimble wibble'.\n\nAnswer: no",
