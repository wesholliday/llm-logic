When we consider the statement 'The wumble might be plonk flump and snork zibber quank', we are essentially adding another condition ('snork zibber quank') to the original statement. However, the original statement does not provide any information about 'snork zibber quank', nor does it imply or suggest the existence of this condition. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the additional condition from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
