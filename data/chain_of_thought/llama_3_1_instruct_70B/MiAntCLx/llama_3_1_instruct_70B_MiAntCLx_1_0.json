The original statement only mentions 'The zazzle might be blurble', which expresses a possibility about the zazzle being blurble. However, it does not provide any information about 'quorple a zizz'. The statement we are trying to infer adds new information ('quorple a zizz') that is not present in the original statement. Since the original statement does not provide any information about 'quorple a zizz', we cannot logically infer the additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
