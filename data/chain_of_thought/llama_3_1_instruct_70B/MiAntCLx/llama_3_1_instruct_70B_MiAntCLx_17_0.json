The original statement only mentions the possibility of the blimp being zooble, but it does not provide any information about being blurble by froodle. The concept of being blurble by froodle is entirely new and unrelated to the original statement. \n\nIn logic, we cannot infer a new statement that introduces additional information not present in the original statement. The original statement only expresses a possibility about the blimp being zooble, but it does not provide any basis for the additional claim about being blurble by froodle.\n\nAnswer: no",
