            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The frazzle might be snizzle or blurble' is a disjunction, which means it presents two possible alternatives. In this case, 'or' is used to connect the two options 'snizzle' and 'blurble'. The word 'might' indicates uncertainty or possibility, applying to the entire disjunction. \n\nWhen we break down the statement, we can see that 'might' is not explicitly repeated for each option. However, the structure of the sentence implies that the uncertainty applies to both alternatives. This is because 'might' is often used to express a possibility that applies to the entire disjunction, rather than just one part of it.\n\nGiven this, we can infer that the original statement is equivalent to saying 'The frazzle might be snizzle or it might be blurble', as the uncertainty expressed by 'might' is implied to apply to both options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
