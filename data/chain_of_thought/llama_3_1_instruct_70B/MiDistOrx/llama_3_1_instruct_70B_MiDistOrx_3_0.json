            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The snork might be in the wibble or on the quank' is a disjunction, which means it presents two possible alternatives. The word 'or' is used to connect these alternatives, indicating that the snork could be in one place or the other. The phrase 'might be' is used to express uncertainty or possibility, which applies to both alternatives. \n\nWhen we rephrase the statement as 'The snork might be in the wibble or it might be on the quank', we are explicitly applying the uncertainty to both alternatives. This rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, as it still presents the same two possibilities and expresses the same level of uncertainty.\n\nAnswer: yes",
