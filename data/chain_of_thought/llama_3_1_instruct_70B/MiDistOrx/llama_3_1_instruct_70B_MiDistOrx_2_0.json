            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The wibble might be on the zizz or in the snizzle' uses the word 'or' to connect two possible locations for 'the wibble'. The word 'might' is used to express uncertainty about the location. The phrase 'or in the snizzle' implies an alternative possibility for the location of 'the wibble'. \n\nIn the proposed inference 'The wibble might be on the zizz or it might be in the snizzle', the word 'it' is used to refer back to 'the wibble', and 'might' is repeated to express the same uncertainty about the alternative location. This makes the inference logically equivalent to the original statement, as it explicitly states the uncertainty about both locations.\n\nAnswer: yes",
