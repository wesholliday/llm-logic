Lucy went to the zoo (B).\n\nIn this case, we are trying to determine if we can conclude that Joe went to the park (A). However, the given statements only establish a one-way relationship between A and B. The first statement says that if A happens, then B happens, but it does not guarantee that if B happens, then A must happen. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo that are unrelated to Joe going to the park.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
