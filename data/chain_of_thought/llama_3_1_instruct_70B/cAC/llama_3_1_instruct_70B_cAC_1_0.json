            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and a categorical statement. The conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' implies that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that if the consequence is true, the condition must also be true. This is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy.\n\nIn this case, we are given that Sue was at the wedding, but this does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, and Mary's presence is not a requirement for Sue's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
