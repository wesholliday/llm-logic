The original statement only mentions that the medicine must be taken with food, but it does not provide any information about the frequency of taking the medicine. The statement about taking the medicine twice daily is not mentioned or implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the additional information about the frequency of taking the medicine.\n\nAnswer: no",
