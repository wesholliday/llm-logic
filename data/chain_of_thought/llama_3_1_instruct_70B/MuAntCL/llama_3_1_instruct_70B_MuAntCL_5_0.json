The original statement only mentions that the package must have been delivered yesterday, but it does not provide any information about whether it was signed for or not. Signing for a package is an additional action that may or may not have occurred during delivery. Since there is no information about signing in the original statement, we cannot assume that the package was signed for.\n\nAnswer: no",
