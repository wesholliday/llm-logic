The original statement only mentions that the room was cleaned daily, but it does not provide any information about the presence of fresh towels. The presence of fresh towels is an additional condition that is not mentioned in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the presence of fresh towels from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
