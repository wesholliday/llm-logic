The original statement only mentions that the contract must have been valid for a year, but it does not provide any information about the contract being renewable. The concept of renewability is not mentioned or implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot assume or infer that the contract was renewable based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
