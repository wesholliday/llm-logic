The original statement only mentions the accuracy of the report, but it does not provide any information about the submission time. The statement 'The report must have been accurate and been submitted by noon' adds an additional condition (been submitted by noon) that is not present in the original statement. Since we cannot derive the submission time from the original statement, we cannot infer the new statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
