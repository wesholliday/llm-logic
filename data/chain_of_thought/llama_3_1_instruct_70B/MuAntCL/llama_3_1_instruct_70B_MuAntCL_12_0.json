The original statement only mentions the completion date of the project, which is Friday. It does not provide any information about the project's budget. \n\nInference requires drawing a conclusion based on the given information. Since the original statement does not mention the budget, we cannot logically infer that the project was under budget. The statement only guarantees that the project was completed by Friday, but it does not provide any details about the project's financial aspects.\n\nAnswer: No",
