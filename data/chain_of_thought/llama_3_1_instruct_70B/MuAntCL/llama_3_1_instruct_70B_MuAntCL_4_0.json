The original statement only mentions the time of the meeting, which is 2 PM. There is no information about the location of the meeting, specifically whether it was in the conference room or not. \n\nSince the original statement does not provide any details about the location, we cannot assume or infer that the meeting was in the conference room. The information about the location is not present in the original statement, so we cannot make any conclusions about it.\n\nAnswer: no",
