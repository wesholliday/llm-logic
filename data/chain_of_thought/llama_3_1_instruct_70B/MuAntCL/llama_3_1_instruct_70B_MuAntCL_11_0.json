The original statement only mentions that the software must have been updated, but it does not provide any information about whether the software was restarted or not. Restarting the software is an additional action that may or may not have occurred after the update. Since the original statement does not explicitly mention restarting, we cannot assume that it happened.\n\nAnswer: no",
