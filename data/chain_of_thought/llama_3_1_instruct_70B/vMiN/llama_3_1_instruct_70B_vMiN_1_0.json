            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states 'Mary might not have been at the wedding', which implies that it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding. The conclusion states 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding', which means that it's not necessary for Mary to have been at the wedding.\n\nThe key to understanding this argument is to recognize the relationship between 'might not' and 'must'. 'Might not' implies that something is possible, while 'must' implies that something is necessary. If it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding (as stated in the premise), then it's not necessary for her to have been at the wedding (as stated in the conclusion).\n\nIn logical terms, the premise can be represented as '\u00acN(Mary was at the wedding)', where '\u00ac' represents negation and 'N' represents necessity. The conclusion can be represented as '\u00acN(Mary was at the wedding)'. Since the premise and conclusion are logically equivalent, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
