            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Either Fido is inside (A) or Fido must be in the garden (B).\n2. It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden (\u00acB).\n3. Conclusion: Fido is inside (A).\n\nThis argument follows the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid logical argument form. The disjunctive syllogism states that if we have two alternatives (A or B) and we know that one of them (B) is not true, then we can conclude that the other alternative (A) must be true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise presents two alternatives: Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. The second premise negates one of the alternatives (Fido must be in the garden), which allows us to conclude that the other alternative (Fido is inside) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
