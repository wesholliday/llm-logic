            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket (A) or it must be under the bed (B).\n2. It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed (not B).\n3. The missing sock is in the laundry basket (A).\n\nThis argument follows a logical pattern known as disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have two alternatives (A or B) and we know that one of them (B) is not true, then the other alternative (A) must be true.\n\nIn this case, the first premise presents two alternatives: the missing sock is either in the laundry basket or under the bed. The second premise eliminates the possibility of the sock being under the bed. Therefore, based on the disjunctive syllogism, the conclusion logically follows that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
