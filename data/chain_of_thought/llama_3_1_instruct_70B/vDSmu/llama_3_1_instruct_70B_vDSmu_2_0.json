            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be broken down into the following form:\n\n1. P or Q (Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table)\n3. \u2234 P (The book is on the shelf)\n\nThis form is an example of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid argument form. In a disjunctive syllogism, if we have 'P or Q' and we know that 'Not Q', we can logically conclude 'P'. This is because if 'Q' is not true, then 'P' must be true in order for the original statement 'P or Q' to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
