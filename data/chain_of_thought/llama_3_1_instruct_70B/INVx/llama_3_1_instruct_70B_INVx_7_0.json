            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the whiffle was shanked' and B is 'the whiffle tinked'. This statement does not provide any information about what happens when the whiffle is not shanked. It only tells us what happens when the whiffle is shanked. \n\nIn logic, this type of statement is often represented as A \u2192 B (A implies B). The negation of A (not A) does not necessarily imply the negation of B (not B). In other words, just because A \u2192 B is true, it does not mean that not A \u2192 not B is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
