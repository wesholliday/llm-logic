            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the wug was sproinged' and B is 'it was garpled'. This type of statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the negation of A and the negation of B. In other words, it does not imply that if A is not true, then B is also not true. This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. \n\nIn formal logic, the given statement is represented as A \u2192 B, and the statement we are trying to infer is \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB. However, \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB is not a logically valid conclusion from A \u2192 B. A counterexample can be constructed where A is false and B is true, which would make the original statement true but the inferred statement false.\n\nAnswer: no",
