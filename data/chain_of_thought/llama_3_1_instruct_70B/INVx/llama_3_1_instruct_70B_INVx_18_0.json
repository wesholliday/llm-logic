This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the shank was plooked' and B is 'the shank was nugged'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference. The proposed inference is the contrapositive of the original statement's negation. However, the correct contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked'. \n\nThe proposed inference is actually the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not A, then not B'. However, the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement, and we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
