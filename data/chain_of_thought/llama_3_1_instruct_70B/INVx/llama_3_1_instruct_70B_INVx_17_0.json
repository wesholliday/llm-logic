This type of statement does not provide any information about what happens when A is not true. In other words, it does not imply that if A is not true, then B is not true. This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. \n\nIn this case, we cannot infer that if the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated. The flob could still have movated even if it was not skizzled, as the original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the flob's skizzled state and its movated state when the flob is not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: no",
