            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is in the form of \"If A, then B\" (A \u2192 B), where A is \"the splat was morphed\" and B is \"the splat quanked\". This is a conditional statement. To determine if we can infer \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\", we need to examine the inverse of the original statement.\n\nThe inverse of the original statement would be \"If not A, then not B\" (\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB), where \u00acA is \"the splat was not morphed\" and \u00acB is \"the splat did not quank\". However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, just because A \u2192 B is true, it does not necessarily mean that \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB is true.\n\nIn fact, the correct logical conclusion from A \u2192 B is that if B is false, then A must be false (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA), which is known as the contrapositive. However, we cannot directly infer the inverse (\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB) from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
