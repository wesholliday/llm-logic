This type of statement does not provide information about what happens when the condition A is not met. In other words, it does not imply that if A is not true, then B is not true. This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. \n\nIn this case, we cannot infer that if the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink, because there is no information provided about what happens when the sneg is not crampled. The sneg might still sprot the frink even if it was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: no",
