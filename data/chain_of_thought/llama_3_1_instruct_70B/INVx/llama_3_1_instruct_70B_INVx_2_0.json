This type of statement does not provide any information about the situation when A is not true. In other words, it does not imply that if A is false, then B must be false. This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. \n\nIn this case, we cannot infer that if the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint. The wug might have bimmed the zoint for some other reason, or it might not have bimmed the zoint at all. The given statement only tells us what happens when the wug is flooped, not when it is not.\n\nAnswer: no",
