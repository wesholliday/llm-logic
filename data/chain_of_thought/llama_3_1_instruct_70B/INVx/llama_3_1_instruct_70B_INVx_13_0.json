This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the glip was slogged' and B is 'the glip was tragged'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference. The proposed inference is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is 'If not B, then not A'. However, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, not the inverse. The inverse of the original statement would be 'If not A, then not B', which is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer 'If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged' from the original statement 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged'. The original statement does not provide enough information to conclude that if the glip was not slogged, it was not tragged. There could be other reasons why the glip was tragged, even if it was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: no",
