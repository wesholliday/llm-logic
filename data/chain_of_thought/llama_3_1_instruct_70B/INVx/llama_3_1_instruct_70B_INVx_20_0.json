This type of statement does not provide information about the converse or the inverse. The converse would be 'If it surned, then the fleeg was bluttered', and the inverse would be 'If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn'. However, we cannot logically infer the inverse from the original statement. The original statement only tells us what happens when the fleeg is bluttered, but it does not provide information about what happens when the fleeg is not bluttered. It is possible that the fleeg not being bluttered could still result in it surning, or it could result in something else entirely.\n\nAnswer: no",
