            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is in the form of \"If A, then B\" (A \u2192 B), where A is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and B is \"the dreb was spened\". This is a conditional statement, and it does not provide any information about the relationship between the negation of A and the negation of B.\n\nIn logic, the negation of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is not \"If not A, then not B\". Instead, the negation of \"If A, then B\" is \"A and not B\". This is because the original statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B must be true, but it does not guarantee anything about the situation when A is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" from the original statement. This is an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\nAnswer: no",
