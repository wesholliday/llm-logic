            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can logically infer 'The book was written by James' from the given statements, we need to analyze the structure of the argument. The first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'A \u2192 B', where A is 'The book was written by James' and B is 'The book is a mystery novel'. The second statement 'The book is a mystery novel' is the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the consequent (B) is true, we cannot necessarily conclude that the antecedent (A) is true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. In other words, just because the book is a mystery novel, it does not necessarily mean that it was written by James. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically infer that 'The book was written by James'.\n\nAnswer: no",
