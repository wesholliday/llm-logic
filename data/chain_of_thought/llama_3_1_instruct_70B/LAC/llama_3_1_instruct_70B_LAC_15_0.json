The first statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is a conditional statement where 'Sam took a plane' is the antecedent (or condition) and 'Erin took a train' is the consequent (or result). The second statement 'Erin took a train' affirms the consequent. \n\nHowever, affirming the consequent does not necessarily imply that the antecedent is true. This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as 'affirming the consequent'. In this case, we cannot logically infer that Sam took a plane just because Erin took a train, as there could be other reasons why Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
