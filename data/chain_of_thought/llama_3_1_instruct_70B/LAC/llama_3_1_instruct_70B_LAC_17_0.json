The first statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' is a conditional statement where 'Ben ate pasta' is the antecedent and 'Kate ate salad' is the consequent. The second statement 'Kate ate salad' confirms the consequent. \n\nHowever, in logic, affirming the consequent does not necessarily imply the antecedent. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. In other words, just because Kate ate salad, it does not necessarily mean that Ben ate pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad.\n\nAnswer: no",
