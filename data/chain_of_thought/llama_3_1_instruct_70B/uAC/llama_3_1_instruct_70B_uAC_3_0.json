The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This statement implies that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel, but it does not guarantee that James is the only one who can write a mystery novel. The second statement confirms that the book is indeed a mystery novel.
