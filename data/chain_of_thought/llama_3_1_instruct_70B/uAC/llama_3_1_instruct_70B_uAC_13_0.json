The conditional statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This statement implies that if the car is red, we can conclude that the truck is blue, but it does not guarantee that the car is red if the truck is blue. The categorical statement \"the truck was blue\" confirms that the truck is indeed blue. However, this information alone does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the car is red, as there could be other reasons why the truck is blue that are unrelated to the car's color.\n\nAnswer: no",
