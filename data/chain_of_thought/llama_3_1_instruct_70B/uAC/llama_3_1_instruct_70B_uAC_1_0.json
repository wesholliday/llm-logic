            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) and a categorical statement. The conditional statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding. However, it does not guarantee that Mary was at the wedding if Sue was at the wedding. The categorical statement \"Sue was at the wedding\" confirms that Sue was indeed at the wedding. \n\nHowever, the presence of Sue at the wedding does not necessarily imply that Mary was at the wedding, as the conditional statement only guarantees the presence of Sue if Mary was at the wedding, not the other way around. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, and Mary's presence is not a necessary condition for Sue's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
