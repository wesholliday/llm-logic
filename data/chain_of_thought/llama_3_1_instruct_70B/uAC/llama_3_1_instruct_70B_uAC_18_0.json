The truck was metal.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. However, this statement does not guarantee that the doll is plastic if the truck is metal. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal. Statement 2 confirms that the truck is indeed metal, but it does not provide any direct information about the doll's material.\n\nIn logic, this is an example of affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. It assumes that because the consequence (the truck being metal) is true, the antecedent (the doll being plastic) must also be true. However, this is not necessarily the case.\n\nAnswer: no",
