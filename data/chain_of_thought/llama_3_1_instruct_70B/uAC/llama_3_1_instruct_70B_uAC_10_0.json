The cat was outside.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if the dog is inside, the cat will be outside. However, it does not guarantee that the cat being outside means the dog is inside. There could be other reasons for the cat being outside, such as the cat being outside even when the dog is outside as well.\n\nStatement 2 confirms that the cat is indeed outside, but it does not provide any information about the dog's location. Since statement 1 only provides a one-way implication (dog inside -> cat outside), we cannot conclude the dog's location based solely on the cat being outside.\n\nAnswer: no",
