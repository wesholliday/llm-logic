This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Alex finished the race' and B is 'Chris finished the race'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race', we need to check if the converse of the original statement is true. The converse of 'If A, then B' is 'If B, then A'. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. \n\nIn this case, just because Alex finishing the race implies Chris finishing the race, it does not necessarily mean that Chris finishing the race implies Alex finishing the race. There could be other reasons why Chris finished the race, and Alex not finishing the race does not necessarily prevent Chris from finishing.\n\nAnswer: no",
