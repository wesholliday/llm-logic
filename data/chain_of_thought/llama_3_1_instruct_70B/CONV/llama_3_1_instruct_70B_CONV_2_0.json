This statement implies that if the condition A is true, then B must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the converse situation, i.e., if B is true, then A must be true. In other words, the statement does not guarantee that the presence of the unicorn in the forest necessarily implies the presence of the griffin. \n\nAnswer: No",
