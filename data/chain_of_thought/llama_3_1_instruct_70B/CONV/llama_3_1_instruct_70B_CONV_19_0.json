This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Tom watched football' and B is 'Jen watched basketball'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football', we need to check if the converse of the original statement is true. The converse of 'If A, then B' is 'If B, then A'. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. It does not provide any information about what happens if Jen watched basketball. Jen might have watched basketball even if Tom did not watch football. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
