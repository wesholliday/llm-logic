            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B'. This statement implies that if the condition 'A' (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence 'B' (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the converse situation, i.e., if 'B' is true, then 'A' must be true. In other words, just because Sue was at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. The original statement does not guarantee the truth of the converse statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
