This statement does not provide any information about the situation when the cat is outside. It only tells us what happens when the dog is inside. \n\nTo infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside', we would need a statement of the form 'If B, then A', which is the converse of the original statement. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, and we cannot assume it to be true without additional information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement alone, we cannot infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside'.\n\nAnswer: no",
