This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Jeff played basketball' and B is 'Amy played tennis'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball', we need to check if the converse of the original statement is true. The converse of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If B, then A'. \n\nHowever, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. In this case, just because Jeff playing basketball implies Amy playing tennis, it does not necessarily mean that Amy playing tennis implies Jeff playing basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, and Jeff's actions are not necessarily connected to Amy's actions in the converse scenario.\n\nAnswer: no",
