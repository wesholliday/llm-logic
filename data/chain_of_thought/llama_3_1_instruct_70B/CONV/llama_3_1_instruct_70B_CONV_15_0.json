This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Sam took a plane' and B is 'Erin took a train'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane', we need to check if the converse of the original statement is true. The converse of 'If A, then B' is 'If B, then A'. However, the converse is not necessarily true unless the original statement is a biconditional statement (i.e., 'If and only if').\n\nIn this case, the original statement does not guarantee that Erin taking a train implies Sam took a plane. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, and it does not necessarily mean Sam took a plane. Therefore, we cannot infer the converse from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
