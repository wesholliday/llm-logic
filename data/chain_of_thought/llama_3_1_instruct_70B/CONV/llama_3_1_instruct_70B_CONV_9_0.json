This statement does not imply that the converse is true, i.e., \"If B, then A\" (B \u2192 A). In other words, just because we know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, it does not necessarily mean that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt. The original statement only guarantees the relationship in one direction, not the other.\n\nAnswer: no",
