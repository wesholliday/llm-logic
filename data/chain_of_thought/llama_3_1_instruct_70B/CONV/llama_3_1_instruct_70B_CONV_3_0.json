This statement does not imply that James is the only author who can write mystery novels, nor does it imply that all books written by James are mystery novels. It simply states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. \n\nHowever, the statement we are trying to infer is of the form \"If B, then A\", which is the converse of the original statement. The converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, and in this case, it would imply that the only author who can write mystery novels is James, which is not supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
