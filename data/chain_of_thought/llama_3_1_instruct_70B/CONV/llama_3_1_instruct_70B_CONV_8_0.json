This statement does not provide any information about the converse situation, i.e., 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake'. The converse statement would be of the form 'If B, then A', which is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, just because the mummy being awake is a consequence of the vampire being awake, it does not necessarily mean that the vampire being awake is a consequence of the mummy being awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
