This statement does not imply the converse, which is \"If B, then A\" (B \u2192 A). In other words, just because the presence of the bear in the case guarantees the presence of the wolf in the den, it does not necessarily mean that the presence of the wolf in the den guarantees the presence of the bear in the case. There could be other reasons why the wolf is in the den, unrelated to the bear's presence in the case.\n\nAnswer: no",
