This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Sue chose pizza' and B is 'Bob chose pasta'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza', we need to check if the converse of the original statement is true. The converse of 'If A, then B' is 'If B, then A'. However, the converse is not necessarily true unless the original statement is a biconditional statement (i.e., 'If and only if').\n\nIn this case, the original statement does not guarantee that Bob chose pasta only if Sue chose pizza. There could be other scenarios where Bob chose pasta, even if Sue did not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
