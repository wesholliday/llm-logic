This type of statement does not imply the converse, which is \"If B, then A\". The converse is a different statement that requires separate evidence or reasoning to be true. In this case, we cannot assume that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park, as the original statement only guarantees the relationship in one direction.\n\nAnswer: no",
