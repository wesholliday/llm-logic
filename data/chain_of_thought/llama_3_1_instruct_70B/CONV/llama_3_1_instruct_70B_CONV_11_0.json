This statement does not imply that the converse is true, i.e., \"If B, then A\" (B \u2192 A). In other words, just because we know that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry, it does not necessarily mean that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate. There could be other scenarios where the muffins are blueberry, but the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
