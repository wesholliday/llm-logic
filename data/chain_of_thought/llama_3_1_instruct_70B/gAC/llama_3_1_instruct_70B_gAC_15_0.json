The given statements are: 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' (P \u2192 Q) and 'Erin took a train' (Q). We are asked to determine if 'Sam took a plane' (P) is true.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (P) is true, then the consequence (Q) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true: if the consequence (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the condition (P) is true. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train.\n\nIn this case, we are given that Erin took a train (Q), but we do not have enough information to conclude that Sam took a plane (P). There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, and we cannot assume that Sam's actions are the only possible cause.\n\nAnswer: no",
