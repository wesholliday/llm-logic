Chris finished the race (C)\n\nTo determine if 'Alex finished the race' is true, we need to analyze the relationship between the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement (If A, then C), which means that if the condition 'Alex finished the race' is true, then 'Chris finished the race' must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that 'Alex finished the race' is true if 'Chris finished the race' is true.\n\nIn other words, the first statement does not imply that 'Alex finished the race' is the only condition for 'Chris finished the race' to be true. There could be other conditions or reasons why 'Chris finished the race' is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot conclude that 'Alex finished the race' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
