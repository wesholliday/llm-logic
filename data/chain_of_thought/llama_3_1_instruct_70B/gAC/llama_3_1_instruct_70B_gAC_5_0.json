If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (If A, then B).\n2. Amy played tennis (B).\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude that Jeff played basketball (A) based on these statements. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true, then the consequence (B) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true: if the consequence (B) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the condition (A) is true. There could be other reasons why B is true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Amy played tennis (B), but we cannot conclude that Jeff played basketball (A) solely based on this information. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, unrelated to Jeff playing basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
