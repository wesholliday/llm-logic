            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement. The given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B'. We are also given that 'Sue was at the wedding' (B) is true. \n\nIn logic, this type of argument is known as 'affirming the consequent'. The question is whether we can conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' (A) is true based on the given information.\n\nHowever, affirming the consequent is a logical fallacy. Just because 'Sue was at the wedding' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, and Mary's presence is not the only possible cause.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
