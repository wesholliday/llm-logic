The statement 'The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters' is a compound statement consisting of two parts: 'The exam must have been difficult' and 'covered all chapters'. Since 'covered all chapters' is explicitly mentioned in the original statement, we can directly infer that the exam covered all chapters without relying on the difficulty of the exam.\n\nAnswer: yes",
