The statement 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays and served Italian cuisine' is a compound statement that contains two pieces of information: the restaurant's operating hours and the type of cuisine it serves. \n\nSince the statement explicitly mentions that the restaurant 'served Italian cuisine', this information is directly provided and not inferred. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement does indeed support the inference that the restaurant served Italian cuisine.\n\nAnswer: yes",
