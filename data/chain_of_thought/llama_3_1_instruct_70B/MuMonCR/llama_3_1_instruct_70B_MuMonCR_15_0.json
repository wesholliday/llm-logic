The statement consists of two conditions: the password length (eight characters) and the requirement of including a number. Since the statement explicitly mentions that the password 'included a number', this information is directly provided and does not rely on the password length. Therefore, we can directly infer that the password must have included a number.\n\nAnswer: yes",
