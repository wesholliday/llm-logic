            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have started at 8 PM' from 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM', we need to analyze the given statement. The statement is a conjunction of two clauses: 'The concert must have been sold out' and 'started at 8 PM'. In a conjunction, both clauses are connected by 'and', which means both clauses must be true for the entire statement to be true. \n\nHowever, the question is asking if we can infer one of the clauses ('The concert must have started at 8 PM') from the entire statement. Since the statement is a conjunction, we can indeed infer each individual clause from the entire statement. This is because if the entire statement is true, then both clauses must be true, and therefore, we can conclude that 'The concert must have started at 8 PM' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
