            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The software must have been restarted' from 'The software must have been updated and restarted', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conjunction of two actions: 'updated' and 'restarted'. In a conjunction, both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true. If we remove one of the conditions ('updated'), the remaining condition ('restarted') is still a necessary part of the original statement. Therefore, if the software must have been updated and restarted, it logically follows that the software must have been restarted.\n\nAnswer: yes",
