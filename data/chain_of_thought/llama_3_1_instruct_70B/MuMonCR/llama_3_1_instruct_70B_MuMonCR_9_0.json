The statement 'The flight must have been delayed and rerouted' is a compound statement consisting of two parts: 'The flight must have been delayed' and 'The flight must have been rerouted'. Since 'The flight must have been rerouted' is a part of the compound statement, it is already explicitly stated. Therefore, we can directly infer 'The flight must have been rerouted' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
