            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The meeting must have been in the conference room' from 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room', we need to analyze the given statement. The original statement is a conjunction of two conditions: the meeting time (2 PM) and the meeting location (the conference room). In logic, a conjunction is true only if both conditions are true. However, if we remove one condition (the meeting time), the remaining condition (the meeting location) still holds true as part of the original statement. Therefore, we can indeed infer the meeting location from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
