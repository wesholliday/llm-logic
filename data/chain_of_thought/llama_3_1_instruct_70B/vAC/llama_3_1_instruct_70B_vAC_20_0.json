            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of:\n\nIf A, then B\nB\n\u2234 A\n\nThis form is known as \"affirming the consequent.\" It is a fallacy because it assumes that if B is true, then A must be true, which is not necessarily the case. There could be other reasons why B is true, and A might not be one of them.\n\nIn this specific argument, the first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. However, it does not rule out the possibility that the banana could be yellow for other reasons, such as the banana being naturally yellow. The second premise states that the banana was indeed yellow, but this does not necessarily mean that the apple was red.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that the apple was red does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
