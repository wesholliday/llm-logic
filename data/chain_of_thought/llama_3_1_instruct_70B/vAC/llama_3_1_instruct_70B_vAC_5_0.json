The argument is in the form of:\n\nIf A, then B\nB\n\u2234 A\n\nThis form is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only guarantees that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it does not guarantee that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, and Jeff's playing basketball is not the only possible cause.\n\nAnswer: No",
