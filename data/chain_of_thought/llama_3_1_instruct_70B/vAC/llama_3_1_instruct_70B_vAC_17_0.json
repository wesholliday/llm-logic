The argument is in the form of:\n\nIf A, then B\nB\n\u2234 A\n\nThis form is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only guarantees that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, but it does not guarantee that Kate eating salad implies Ben ate pasta. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad, and the argument does not provide enough information to conclude that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: No",
