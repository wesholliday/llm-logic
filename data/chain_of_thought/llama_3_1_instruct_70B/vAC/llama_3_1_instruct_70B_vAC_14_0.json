This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as 'affirming the consequent'. In this form, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only guarantees that if A is true, then B is true, but it does not guarantee that if B is true, then A is true. There could be other reasons why B is true, and A might not be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
