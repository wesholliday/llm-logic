The argument is in the form of:\n\nIf A, then B\nB\n\u2234 A\n\nThis form is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only guarantees that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, but it does not guarantee that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt, and the argument does not provide enough information to conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
