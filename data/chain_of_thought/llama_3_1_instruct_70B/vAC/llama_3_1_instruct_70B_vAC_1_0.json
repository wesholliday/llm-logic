            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is as follows:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was at the wedding.\n3. Therefore, Mary was at the wedding.\n\nThis argument is an example of affirming the consequent, a common logical fallacy. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. However, it does not state that Sue's presence at the wedding is exclusive to Mary's presence. In other words, there could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, even if Mary was not.\n\nThe second premise confirms that Sue was at the wedding, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence. The conclusion, therefore, is not logically supported by the premises. The argument is trying to infer Mary's presence based solely on Sue's presence, which is not a valid logical connection.\n\nAnswer: No",
