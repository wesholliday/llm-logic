            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and a categorical statement. The conditional statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', which can be represented as 'If A, then B'. The categorical statement is 'Sue was at the wedding', which can be represented as 'B'. \n\nIn logic, this is an example of affirming the consequent. The conditional statement only guarantees that if A (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then B (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that if B is true, then A must also be true. There could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, even if Mary was not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
