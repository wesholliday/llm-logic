            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding', let's analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Mary was not at the wedding' is a direct assertion about Mary's presence. The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know Mary was not at the wedding. The second statement implies that if Mary were at the wedding, Sue would also be at the wedding. However, since Mary was not at the wedding, we cannot directly infer Sue's presence or absence from the conditional statement.\n\nThe conditional statement only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary is present, but it does not provide any information about Sue's presence if Mary is not present. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sue was not at the wedding based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
