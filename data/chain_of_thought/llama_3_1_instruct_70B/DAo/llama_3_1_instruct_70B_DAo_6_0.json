The first statement 'Sue did not choose pizza' tells us about Sue's choice, but it does not directly tell us about Bob's choice. The second statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is a conditional statement that provides information about Bob's choice only if Sue chose pizza. However, since we know Sue did not choose pizza, the condition for the second statement is not met. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Bob's choice from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
