The second statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B' (where A is 'the cake was chocolate' and B is 'the muffins were blueberry'). \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the consequence (B). In this case, since we know the cake was not chocolate (A is false), we cannot infer anything about the muffins being blueberry or not. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if the cake was chocolate, but it does not provide any information about the muffins when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
