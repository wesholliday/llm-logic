            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo', let's analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'Joe did not go to the park'. The second statement is a conditional statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This is a classic example of a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then B'. \n\nIn this case, A is 'Joe went to the park' and B is 'Lucy went to the zoo'. Since we know that A ('Joe went to the park') is false (from the first statement), we cannot directly infer the truth value of B ('Lucy went to the zoo') from the conditional statement alone. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if A were true, but it does not provide any information about what happens when A is false.\n\nHowever, we can use the concept of contrapositive to analyze the situation. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. But in this case, we are given 'not A' (Joe did not go to the park) and we want to find 'not B' (Lucy did not go to the zoo). The contrapositive would be 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. Since we already know 'Joe did not go to the park', we cannot use the contrapositive to infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo'.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
