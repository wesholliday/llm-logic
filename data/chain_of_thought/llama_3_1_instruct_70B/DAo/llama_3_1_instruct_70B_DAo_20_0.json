            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The banana was not yellow', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement 'The apple was not red' provides information about the color of the apple. The second statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement that links the color of the apple to the color of the banana.\n\nIn this case, the condition 'If the apple was red' is not met, as we know the apple was not red. Since the condition is not met, we cannot conclude the consequence 'then the banana was yellow'. However, this does not necessarily mean the banana was not yellow. The banana's color is not directly related to the apple's actual color, but rather to the hypothetical scenario where the apple is red.\n\nIn logic, this is an example of a 'modus tollens' argument, but in this case, we are trying to apply it in reverse. The correct application of modus tollens would be: 'If A, then B; not A' does not necessarily imply 'not B'. Instead, it simply means we cannot conclude B.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
