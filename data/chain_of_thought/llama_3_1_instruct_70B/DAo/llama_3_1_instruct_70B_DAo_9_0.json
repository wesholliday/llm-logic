            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' is a simple negation. The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (in this case, 'Lisa bought the red shirt') is false, we cannot determine the truth value of the conclusion (in this case, 'Mark bought the blue shirt'). This is because a conditional statement only guarantees the truth of the conclusion when the condition is true, but it does not provide any information about the conclusion when the condition is false.\n\nSince we know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, the condition of the conditional statement is false. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about Mark buying the blue shirt from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
