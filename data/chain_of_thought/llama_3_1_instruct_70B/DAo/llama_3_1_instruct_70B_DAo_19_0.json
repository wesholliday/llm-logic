            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Jen did not watch basketball', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'Tom did not watch football'. The second statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B' or 'A \u2192 B', where A is 'Tom watched football' and B is 'Jen watched basketball'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is false, we cannot determine the truth value of the conclusion (B). In this case, since Tom did not watch football (A is false), we cannot conclude that Jen did not watch basketball (B is false). The conditional statement only guarantees that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, but it does not provide any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football.\n\nAnswer: no",
