            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was not metal', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The doll was not plastic'. The second statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the doll was plastic' and B is 'the truck was metal'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the consequence (B). In this case, since we know the doll was not plastic (A is false), we cannot infer anything about the material of the truck (B). The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if the doll was plastic, but it does not provide any information about the truck when the doll is not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
