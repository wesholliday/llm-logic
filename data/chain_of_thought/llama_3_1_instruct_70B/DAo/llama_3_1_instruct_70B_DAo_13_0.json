            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was not blue', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The car was not red'. The second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the car was red' and B is 'the truck was blue'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is false, we cannot conclude anything about the truth of the consequence (B). In this case, since we know the car was not red (A is false), we cannot infer anything about the color of the truck (B). The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if the car was red, but it does not provide any information about the color of the truck when the car is not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
