The original statement only mentions that 'The zooble must be flonk', but it does not provide any information about 'gronk'. There is no logical connection or relationship established between 'flonk' and 'gronk' in the given statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the additional information about 'gronk' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
