The original statement only mentions the glorp being in the flibbit blimp, but it does not provide any information about the glorp being in the plonk wump. The statement about the plonk wump is not mentioned or implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the additional information about the plonk wump from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
