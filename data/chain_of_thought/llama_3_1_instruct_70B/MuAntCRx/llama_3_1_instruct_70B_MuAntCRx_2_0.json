The second statement includes the original action 'flump a bimboozle quazzle' from the first statement, but it also adds a new action 'glorp a zibble snizzle'. Since the first statement does not provide any information about 'glorp a zibble snizzle', we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first. The first statement only mentions 'flump a bimboozle quazzle', and there is no basis to assume the additional action 'glorp a zibble snizzle'.\n\nAnswer: no",
