The second statement includes all the words from the first statement ('The grooble must frazzle quibble wibble') and adds two new words ('snork wozzle grooble'). \n\nHowever, the addition of these new words changes the meaning of the original statement. The original statement is a single, coherent phrase, while the second statement appears to be a combination of two separate phrases ('The grooble must snork wozzle grooble' and 'The grooble must frazzle quibble wibble'). \n\nSince the second statement is not a direct logical consequence of the first statement, and the added words change the meaning, we cannot infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
