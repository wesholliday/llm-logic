The original statement only mentions 'glorp a flonk', but the inferred statement includes an additional action 'grooble a quazzle'. Since there is no information provided about 'grooble a quazzle' in the original statement, we cannot logically infer that 'The zibble must grooble a quazzle and glorp a flonk' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
