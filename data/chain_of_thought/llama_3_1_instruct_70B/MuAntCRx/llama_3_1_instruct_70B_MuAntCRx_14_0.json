The original statement 'The grooble must be snork' only provides information about the grooble being snork, but it does not mention anything about the grooble being zizz. \n\nIn logic, we cannot infer a new property (in this case, 'zizz') that is not present in the original statement. The original statement only guarantees that the grooble is snork, but it does not provide any information about the grooble being zizz. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The grooble must be zizz and be snork' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
