It only states that 'The fizzle must gronk at zump wumble'. To infer 'The fizzle must snizzle at shimble quazzle and gronk at zump wumble', we would need additional information that connects 'snizzle', 'shimble', and 'quazzle' to 'The fizzle'. However, since the original statement does not provide this information, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
