However, the condition of paying the bill implies that the payment is successful and the bill is actually paid. If the check bounces, it means the payment was not successful, and the bill was not actually paid. Therefore, the condition of the original statement is not met, and we cannot infer that the services will continue.\n\nAnswer: no",
