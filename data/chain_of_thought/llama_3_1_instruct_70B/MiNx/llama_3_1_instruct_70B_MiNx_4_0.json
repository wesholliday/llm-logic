The original statement is 'The fribble might not have been snurgled', which implies that it's possible the fribble wasn't snurgled. This statement is equivalent to saying 'It's possible that the fribble wasn't snurgled'. \n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled'. This statement is equivalent to saying 'The fribble doesn't necessarily have to be snurgled'. \n\nSince 'The fribble might not have been snurgled' implies that it's possible the fribble wasn't snurgled, it also implies that the fribble doesn't necessarily have to be snurgled. Therefore, we can make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
