The original statement is 'The shank might not have been plooked', which implies that it's possible the shank wasn't plooked. The statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked'. This statement is saying that it's not necessary for the shank to have been plooked.\n\nThe original statement is talking about possibility, while the inferred statement is talking about necessity. If something might not have been the case, it means it's not necessary for it to be the case. Therefore, if the shank might not have been plooked, it implies that it's not the case that the shank must have been plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
