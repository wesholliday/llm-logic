The original statement is 'The twonk might not have been plinked'. This statement implies that it's possible the twonk wasn't plinked, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that the twonk was plinked. \n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked'. This statement is saying that it's not necessary for the twonk to have been plinked. \n\nSince 'The twonk might not have been plinked' implies that it's possible the twonk wasn't plinked, it also implies that it's not necessary for the twonk to have been plinked. Therefore, we can make the inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
