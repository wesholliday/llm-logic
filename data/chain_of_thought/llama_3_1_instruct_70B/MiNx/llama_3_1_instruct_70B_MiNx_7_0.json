The original statement is 'The whiffle might not have been shanked', which implies that it's possible the whiffle wasn't shanked. This statement is equivalent to saying 'It's possible that the whiffle wasn't shanked'. \n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked'. This statement is equivalent to saying 'It's not necessary that the whiffle was shanked'. \n\nSince 'might not have been shanked' implies that it's possible the whiffle wasn't shanked, it also implies that it's not necessary for the whiffle to have been shanked. Therefore, we can make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
