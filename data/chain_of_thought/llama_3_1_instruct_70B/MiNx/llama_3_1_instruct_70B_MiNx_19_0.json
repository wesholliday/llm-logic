The original statement is 'The smonk might not have been vreebled'. This statement implies that it's possible the smonk wasn't vreebled, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it was vreebled. \n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled'. This statement is saying that it's not necessary for the smonk to have been vreebled. \n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility that the smonk wasn't vreebled, it also implies that it's not necessary for the smonk to have been vreebled. Therefore, the inference seems valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
