The original statement is 'The flob might not have been skizzled'. This statement implies that it's possible the flob wasn't skizzled, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it was skizzled. \n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled'. This statement is saying that it's not necessary for the flob to have been skizzled. \n\nSince 'The flob might not have been skizzled' implies that it's possible the flob wasn't skizzled, it also implies that it's not necessary for the flob to have been skizzled. Therefore, we can make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
