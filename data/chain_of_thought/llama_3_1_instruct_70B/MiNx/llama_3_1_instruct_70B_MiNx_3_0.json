The original statement is 'The splat might not have been morphed', which implies that it is possible that the splat was not morphed. This statement does not assert that the splat was definitely not morphed, but rather that it is a possibility.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed'. This statement is equivalent to saying that it is not necessary that the splat was morphed. In other words, it is possible that the splat was not morphed.\n\nSince both statements convey the idea that it is possible that the splat was not morphed, we can see that they are logically equivalent. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
