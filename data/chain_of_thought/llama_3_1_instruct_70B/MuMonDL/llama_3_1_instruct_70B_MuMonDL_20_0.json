'Black-tie' is a specific type of formal event, often more formal than a general formal event. Since 'formal' is a broader category that includes 'black-tie', we can conclude that if an event is formal, it could also be considered as either formal or black-tie, as 'black-tie' is a subset of formal events.\n\nAnswer: yes",
