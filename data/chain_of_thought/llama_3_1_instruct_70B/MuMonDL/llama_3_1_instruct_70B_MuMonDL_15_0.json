It does not mention anything about the presence or absence of special characters. To infer that the password 'must have been eight characters long or contained special characters', we would need additional information that explicitly states the password could have special characters or that the length requirement is not the only requirement. Since we do not have this information, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
