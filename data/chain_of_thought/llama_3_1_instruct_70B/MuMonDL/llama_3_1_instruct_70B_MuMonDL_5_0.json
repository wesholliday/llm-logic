            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow' from 'The package must have been delivered today', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The package must have been delivered today' implies a specific day for the delivery, which is today. The statement 'The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow' includes today as a possibility but also adds another option, which is tomorrow. Since 'today' is a subset of 'today or tomorrow', the second statement is a broader and more inclusive statement than the first one. Therefore, if the package must have been delivered today, it is also true that the package must have been delivered today or tomorrow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
