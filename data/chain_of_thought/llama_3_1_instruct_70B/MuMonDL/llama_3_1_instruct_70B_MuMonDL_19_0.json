            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The application must have been completed online or submitted electronically' from 'The application must have been completed online', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement specifically mentions that the application 'must have been completed online', which implies that it was done through the internet. The inferred statement adds an alternative option, 'submitted electronically', which is a broader term that encompasses online submissions as well as other forms of electronic submissions, such as email or digital file transfers.\n\nSince 'completed online' is a subset of 'submitted electronically', we can infer that if an application must be completed online, it also must be submitted electronically. However, the converse is not necessarily true, as an application can be submitted electronically without being completed online (e.g., by filling out a digital form offline and then submitting it via email).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical relationship between the two statements, we can infer the broader statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
