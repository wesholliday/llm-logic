            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The contract must have been valid for a year or longer' from 'The contract must have been valid for a year', we need to analyze the meaning of the original statement. The phrase 'must have been valid for a year' implies a minimum duration of one year, but it does not explicitly exclude the possibility of the contract being valid for more than a year. \n\nIn general, when a minimum duration is specified, it is often implied that the duration could be longer, but not shorter. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the contract could have been valid for a year or longer, as this includes the minimum duration specified in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
