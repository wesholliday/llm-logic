The original statement 'The movie must have been in English' implies that the movie was in English, but it does not provide any information about the presence of subtitles. The statement 'The movie must have been in English or had English subtitles' includes the possibility of the movie being in English, which is already stated in the original statement, and adds an additional possibility of the movie having English subtitles. Since the original statement does not provide any information about subtitles, we cannot infer the presence of subtitles from it.\n\nAnswer: no",
