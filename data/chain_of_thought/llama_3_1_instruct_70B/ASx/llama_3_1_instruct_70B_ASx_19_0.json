The original statement is 'If the krimp is in the zool, then the snarf will be glonked.' This statement establishes a relationship between the krimp being in the zool and the snarf being glonked. \n\nThe new statement adds an additional condition: 'the zool is zapped.' However, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the zool is zapped. It only tells us what happens when the krimp is in the zool. \n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about the effect of zapping the zool, we cannot infer the new statement from the original statement. The new statement introduces a new condition that is not addressed in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
