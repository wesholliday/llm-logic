The original statement is 'If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled.' This statement establishes a relationship between the tizzer being on and the goom being snurpled. \n\nThe new statement adds an additional condition: 'the plink light is out.' However, the original statement does not mention the plink light at all. Since the original statement only talks about the tizzer and the goom, we can still apply the original rule even if the plink light is out. The plink light being out does not contradict or change the relationship between the tizzer and the goom.\n\nTherefore, we can still infer that if the tizzer is on, the goom is snurpled, regardless of the state of the plink light.\n\nAnswer: yes",
