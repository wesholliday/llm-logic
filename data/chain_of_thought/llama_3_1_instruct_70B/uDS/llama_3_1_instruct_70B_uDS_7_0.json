To determine if we can infer that the umbrella is in the car, we can use a process of elimination. Since we know the umbrella isn't in the closet, we can eliminate that option. Given that the umbrella is either in the car or the closet, and it's not in the closet, it must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
