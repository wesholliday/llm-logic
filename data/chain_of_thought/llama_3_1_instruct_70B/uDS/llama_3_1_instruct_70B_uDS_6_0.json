The first statement says that either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen. This is an 'or' statement, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. The second statement says that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen. \n\nSince the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, we can eliminate the second condition of the 'or' statement. However, the 'or' statement still needs to be true, so the first condition (the phone is in the living room) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
