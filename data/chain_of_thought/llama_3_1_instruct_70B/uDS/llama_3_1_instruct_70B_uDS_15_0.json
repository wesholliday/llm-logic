We are presented with two possible locations for the shoes: the closet or lined up by the door. We are also given the information that the shoes are not lined up by the door. Since we have only two possible locations and one of them is ruled out, we can infer that the shoes must be in the other location, which is the closet. This type of reasoning is based on the principle of the excluded middle, where if a statement is true or false and one option is eliminated, the other option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
