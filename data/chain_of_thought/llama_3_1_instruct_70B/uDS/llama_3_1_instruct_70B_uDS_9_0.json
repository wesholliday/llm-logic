We are presented with two possible locations for the missing puzzle piece: the box or the floor. We are also given the information that the missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor. This means we can eliminate the floor as a possible location for the missing puzzle piece. Since the only other option is the box, and we have eliminated the floor, it is logical to conclude that the missing puzzle piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
