The first statement says that the remote control is either on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch. This is an 'or' statement, which means that the remote control can be in one of these two places, but not both. The second statement says that the remote control isn't hiding under the couch. This statement eliminates one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement. \n\nSince the remote control can't be under the couch, and it can only be in one of the two places mentioned, we can conclude that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
