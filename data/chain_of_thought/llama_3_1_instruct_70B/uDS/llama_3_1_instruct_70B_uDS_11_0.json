The first statement presents two possible locations for the newspaper, and the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities. Since the newspaper can't be on the porch, the only remaining option is that it is in the driveway. This is an example of a process of elimination, where we eliminate one option and conclude that the other option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
