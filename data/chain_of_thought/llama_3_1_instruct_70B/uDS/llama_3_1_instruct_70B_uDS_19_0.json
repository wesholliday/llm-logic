To determine if we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser, we need to analyze the information provided. \n\nStatement (1) presents two possible locations for the watch: the dresser or his wrist. Statement (2) eliminates one of these possibilities by stating that the watch isn't on his wrist. \n\nGiven that the watch can only be in one of the two locations, and we know it's not on his wrist, we can logically conclude that the watch must be in the other location, which is the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
