The first statement provides two possible locations for the scarf: either it's in the backpack or it's on the coat rack. The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities by stating that the scarf is not on the coat rack. \n\nGiven that there are only two options and one has been ruled out, we can use a process of elimination to determine the location of the scarf. Since the scarf is not on the coat rack, the only remaining option is that it is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
