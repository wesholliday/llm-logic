            "content": "Explanation: We are given two statements: 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden' and 'Fido is not in the garden'. The first statement presents two possibilities for Fido's location, while the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities. Since Fido cannot be in the garden, we can infer that the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside. This is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, where we eliminate one option and conclude the other option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
