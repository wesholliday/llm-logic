            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer, we need to analyze the given information. The first statement provides two possible locations for the notebook: the drawer or the nightstand. This is an 'either-or' situation, where the notebook can only be in one of these two locations. The second statement tells us that the notebook is not on the nightstand. Since we know the notebook can only be in one of the two locations, and it's not on the nightstand, we can logically conclude that the notebook must be in the other location, which is the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
