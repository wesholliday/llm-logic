We are also given the information that the missing sock is not under the bed. This information eliminates one of the two possible locations, leaving us with only one remaining option: the laundry basket. Since there are no other possible locations mentioned, and we have eliminated one of the two options, we can logically conclude that the missing sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
