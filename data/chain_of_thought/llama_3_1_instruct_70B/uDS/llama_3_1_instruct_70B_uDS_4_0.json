The first statement presents two possibilities, and the second statement eliminates one of those possibilities. Since the cat isn't playing in the bedroom, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch. This is an example of a logical process called disjunctive syllogism, where we eliminate one option from a set of possibilities and conclude that the remaining option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
