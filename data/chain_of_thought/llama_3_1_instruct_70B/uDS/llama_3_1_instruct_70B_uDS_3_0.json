The first statement provides two possible locations for the keys: the drawer or the cabinet. The second statement eliminates one of these possibilities by stating that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet. \n\nGiven that the keys can only be in one of the two locations and the cabinet is no longer a possibility, we can logically conclude that the keys must be in the other location, which is the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
