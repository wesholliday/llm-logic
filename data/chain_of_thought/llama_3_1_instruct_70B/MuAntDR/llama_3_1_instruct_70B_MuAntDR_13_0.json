The use of 'or' implies that either condition is sufficient, but it does not guarantee that the movie was subtitled. It only guarantees that it was either in English or subtitled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the movie must have been subtitled, as it could have been in English instead.\n\nAnswer: no",
