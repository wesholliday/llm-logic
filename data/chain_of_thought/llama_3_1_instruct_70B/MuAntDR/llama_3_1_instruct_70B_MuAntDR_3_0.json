The use of 'or' in this context is inclusive, meaning that the keys could have been in the drawer, on the table, or possibly in both locations (although the latter is unlikely in this context). Since we do not have any additional information that would allow us to conclude that the keys were definitely on the table, we cannot infer that the keys must have been on the table.\n\nAnswer: no",
