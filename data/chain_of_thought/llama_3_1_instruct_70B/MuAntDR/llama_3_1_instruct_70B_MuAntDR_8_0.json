            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The restaurant must have been closed on Monday or open for limited hours' presents two possible scenarios: the restaurant was either closed or open for limited hours. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true, but it does not specify which one. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the restaurant was open for limited hours, as it could also have been closed.\n\nAnswer: no",
