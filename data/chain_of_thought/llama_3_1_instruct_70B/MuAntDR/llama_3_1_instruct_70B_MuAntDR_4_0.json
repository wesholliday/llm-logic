The statement presents two possibilities: the meeting was at 2 PM, or it was cancelled. However, it does not provide any information that would allow us to eliminate the possibility of the meeting being at 2 PM. Without additional information, we cannot conclude that the meeting was definitely cancelled. The statement leaves both options open, and we cannot make a definitive inference about the meeting being cancelled.\n\nAnswer: no",
