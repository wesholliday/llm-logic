The use of 'or' in this context indicates that the two options are alternatives, and it does not necessarily mean that both conditions were met. However, it does guarantee that at least one of the conditions was met. Since 'upon request' is one of the options, we can infer that the room was indeed cleaned upon request, assuming a request was made.\n\nAnswer: yes",
