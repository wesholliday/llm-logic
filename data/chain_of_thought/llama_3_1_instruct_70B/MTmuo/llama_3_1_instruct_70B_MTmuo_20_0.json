            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow' implies that the banana's color is uncertain or not necessarily yellow. The second statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' is a conditional statement that links the color of the apple to the color of the banana. \n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, but we know that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This means the condition (the apple being red) cannot be true, because if it were, the banana would have to be yellow, which contradicts the first statement. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the apple was not red, as this is the only way to avoid the contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
