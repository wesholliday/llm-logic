            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Tom did not watch football', let's break down the given statements. The first statement is 'It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball', which can be rephrased as 'Jen may or may not have watched basketball'. The second statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball'. \n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. However, the first statement tells us that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that the condition 'Tom watched football' cannot be true, because if it were true, then Jen must have watched basketball, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football, because if he did, it would lead to a contradiction with the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
