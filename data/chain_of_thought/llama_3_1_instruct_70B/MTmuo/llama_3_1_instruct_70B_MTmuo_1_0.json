            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', let's break down the given statements. The first statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding' implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is not a certainty. The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' is a conditional statement that links Mary's presence to Sue's presence. \n\nIf Mary was at the wedding, then according to the second statement, Sue must have been at the wedding. However, the first statement tells us that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This creates a contradiction if we assume Mary was at the wedding. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
