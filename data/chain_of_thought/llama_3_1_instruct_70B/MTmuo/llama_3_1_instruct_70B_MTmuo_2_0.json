            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can break it down into logical steps. Let's denote 'U' as 'the unicorn was in the forest' and 'G' as 'the griffin was in the forest'. \n\nThe first statement 'It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest' can be translated to 'It's possible that the unicorn was not in the forest', which is equivalent to 'The unicorn was not necessarily in the forest'. However, this statement can also be interpreted as 'The unicorn was not in the forest' in a more direct sense. For the purpose of this problem, we will consider the more direct interpretation: 'The unicorn was not in the forest', which can be denoted as '\u00acU' (not U).\n\nThe second statement 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest' can be translated to 'If G, then U', or 'G \u2192 U'.\n\nNow, we have two statements: '\u00acU' and 'G \u2192 U'. We want to determine if we can infer 'The griffin was not in the forest', which is '\u00acG'.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can analyze the situation as follows: If 'G \u2192 U' and '\u00acU', then we can conclude '\u00acG' by the rule of modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if 'A \u2192 B' and '\u00acB', then '\u00acA'. In this case, 'A' is 'G' and 'B' is 'U'. Therefore, we can conclude '\u00acG'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
