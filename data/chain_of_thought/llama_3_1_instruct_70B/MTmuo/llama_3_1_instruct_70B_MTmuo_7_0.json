            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let's denote 'Chris finished the race' as C and 'Alex finished the race' as A.\n\nThe first statement 'It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race' can be expressed as \u00acC (not C), but since it's 'must have finished', it's more accurately represented as \u00ac\u25a1C (not necessarily C), where \u25a1 denotes necessity. However, for simplicity, we can consider it as \u00acC, assuming 'must have finished' implies a strong necessity that can be treated as a fact in this context.\n\nThe second statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race' can be expressed as A \u2192 \u25a1C (if A, then necessarily C). Again, for simplicity, we can treat it as A \u2192 C.\n\nNow, we have two statements: \n1. \u00acC (Chris did not finish the race)\n2. A \u2192 C (If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race)\n\nWe want to infer whether Alex did not finish the race (\u00acA). To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the second statement, which is \u00acC \u2192 \u00acA (if Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race).\n\nGiven that we know Chris did not finish the race (\u00acC), we can use this to infer that Alex did not finish the race (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
