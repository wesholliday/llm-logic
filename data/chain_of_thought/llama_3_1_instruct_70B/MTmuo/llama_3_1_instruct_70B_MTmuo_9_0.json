            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into logical expressions and then analyze the relationship between them. \n\nLet's denote 'Mark bought the blue shirt' as M and 'Lisa bought the red shirt' as L. \n\nThe first statement 'It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt' can be expressed as ~M (not M), but since it's 'must have', it's more accurately represented as ~(M) or more precisely, ~\u25a1M (not necessarily M), where \u25a1 denotes necessity. However, for simplicity, we'll treat it as ~M.\n\nThe second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' can be expressed as L \u2192 \u25a1M.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' (~L) from these two statements.\n\nIf we assume L (Lisa bought the red shirt), then according to the second statement, we would have \u25a1M (Mark must have bought the blue shirt). However, this contradicts the first statement, which says ~\u25a1M (it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt). \n\nSince assuming L leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that L must be false, which means ~L (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nAnswer: yes",
