            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The car was not red', let's break down the given statements. The first statement 'It's not the case that the truck must have been blue' implies that it's possible the truck was not blue. The second statement 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue' sets up a conditional relationship between the car's color and the truck's color. \n\nIf the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. However, we know from the first statement that it's not the case that the truck must have been blue. This means the condition 'the car was red' cannot be true, because if it were, the truck would have to be blue, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
