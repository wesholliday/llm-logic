            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'It's not the case that the truck must have been metal' implies that the truck may or may not have been metal, but it's not a requirement for it to be metal. The second statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal' sets up a condition where if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal.\n\nNow, let's consider the two statements together. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal, but we know that it's not the case that the truck must have been metal. This means that the condition 'the doll was plastic' cannot be true, because if it were true, it would require the truck to be metal, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
