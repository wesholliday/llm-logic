            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton', let's analyze the given statements. The first statement, 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim', implies that it's possible the pants were not denim. The second statement, 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim', sets up a condition where if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, we know from the first statement that it's not necessarily the case that the pants were denim. This means the condition in the second statement (the shirt being cotton) cannot be true, because if it were, the pants would have to be denim, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
