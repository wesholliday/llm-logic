The first statement implies that there are only two possible locations for the pen: in the bag or on the desk. The second statement introduces the possibility that the pen is not on the desk. \n\nHowever, the second statement does not confirm that the pen is not on the desk; it only says it 'might not be'. This means there is still a possibility that the pen is on the desk. Since we cannot rule out the possibility of the pen being on the desk, we cannot conclude with certainty that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: no",
