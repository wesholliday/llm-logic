Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Tom watched football, then Jen definitely watched basketball. However, statement 2 contradicts this by saying Jen might not have watched basketball. This means that the condition in statement 1 (Tom watching football) cannot be true, because if it were, then Jen would have definitely watched basketball, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
