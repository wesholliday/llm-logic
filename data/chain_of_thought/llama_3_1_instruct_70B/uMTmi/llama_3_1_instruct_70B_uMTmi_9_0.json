            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" (where A is Lisa buying the red shirt and B is Mark buying the blue shirt). The second statement says that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, which means that B is not necessarily true.\n\nNow, let's use the concept of contrapositive to analyze the situation. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\". Since we know that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, we can use the contrapositive to infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The key word here is \"did not\", which implies a certainty. While we can infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, we cannot be certain that she did not buy it. There is still a possibility that Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
