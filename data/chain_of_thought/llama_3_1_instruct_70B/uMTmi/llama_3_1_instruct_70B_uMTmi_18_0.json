            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into two parts: \n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This is a conditional statement that implies a relationship between the doll being plastic and the truck being metal. \n2. The truck might not have been metal. This statement introduces the possibility that the truck is not metal.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the doll was not plastic, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. If the truck might not have been metal, it means there's a possibility that the condition for the doll being plastic (i.e., the truck being metal) is not met. However, this does not directly imply that the doll was not plastic, as the doll's material is not directly related to the uncertainty of the truck's material.\n\nHowever, we can use a logical argument to make an inference. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal (according to the first statement). But we know that the truck might not have been metal. If the doll was indeed plastic, then the truck would have to be metal, which contradicts the possibility that the truck might not have been metal. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
