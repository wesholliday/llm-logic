Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\nFrom statement 1, we can infer that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park. This is because the statement implies a necessary condition for Joe going to the park, which is Lucy going to the zoo. If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then the condition is not met, and we cannot conclude that Joe went to the park.\n\nHowever, statement 2 only says that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, which means it is possible but not certain that Lucy did not go to the zoo. Since we do not have a definitive statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo, we cannot conclude with certainty that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
