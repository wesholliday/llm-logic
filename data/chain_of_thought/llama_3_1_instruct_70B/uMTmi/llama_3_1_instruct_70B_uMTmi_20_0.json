            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into two parts: \n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This is a conditional statement, where the color of the apple (red) is the condition, and the color of the banana (yellow) is the consequence.\n2. The banana might not have been yellow. This statement introduces the possibility that the banana was not yellow.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that the apple was not red, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. If the banana might not have been yellow, it means that the consequence of the conditional statement (banana being yellow) did not necessarily occur. However, this does not directly imply that the condition (apple being red) did not occur.\n\nIn logic, this is related to the concept of modus tollens, which states that if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false. However, in this case, we only know that the banana \"might not have been\" yellow, which means we cannot be certain that the consequence is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the apple was not red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
