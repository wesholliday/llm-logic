            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into two parts: \n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. This is a conditional statement that implies if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n2. Sue might not have been at the wedding. This statement implies that it is possible for Sue not to be at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's analyze the situation. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding (from the first statement). However, we know that Sue might not have been at the wedding (from the second statement). This creates a contradiction if we assume Mary was at the wedding, because if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding, but we know that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we can infer that the initial assumption (Mary being at the wedding) must be false. This is because if Mary was not at the wedding, then the condition in the first statement is not met, and we cannot conclude that Sue must have been at the wedding. This aligns with the second statement, which says Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
