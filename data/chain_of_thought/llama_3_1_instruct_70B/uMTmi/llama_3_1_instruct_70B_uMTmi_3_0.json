            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel\"). \n\nThe second statement says that the book might not be a mystery novel. This statement implies that it is possible for the book not to be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between these two statements. If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel. However, we know that the book might not be a mystery novel. This means that the condition \"the book was written by James\" cannot be true, because if it were true, the book would have to be a mystery novel, which contradicts the possibility that it might not be a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
