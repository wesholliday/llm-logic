            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This is a conditional statement, often represented as \"if A, then B\" or A \u2192 B. The second statement says that the mummy might not have been awake, which can be represented as \"not B\" or \u00acB.\n\nUsing the first statement (A \u2192 B) and the second statement (\u00acB), we can apply a logical rule called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA. In this case, if the vampire being awake (A) implies the mummy being awake (B), and the mummy might not have been awake (\u00acB), then we can conclude that the vampire was not awake (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
