            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply logical reasoning. The first statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"Tom watched football\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball\"). The second statement is \"Jen did not watch basketball,\" which is the negation of B.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if A implies B and B is false, then A must be false. In this case, if Tom watching football implies Jen watching basketball, and Jen did not watch basketball, then we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
