            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This statement implies that if the car is indeed red, then the truck must be blue. However, it does not provide any information about the color of the truck if the car is not red.\n\nThe second statement is a simple negation: \"The truck was not blue.\" This statement tells us that the truck is definitely not blue.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the truck is not blue, and the first statement says that the truck would be blue if the car is red, then we can infer that the car cannot be red. This is because if the car were red, the truck would have to be blue, but we know that the truck is not blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
