            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical approach. The given statements are: \n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. (This is a conditional statement, often represented as 'If A, then B' or A \u2192 B, where A is 'Mary was at the wedding' and B is 'Sue was at the wedding'.)\n2. Sue was not at the wedding. (This is a negation of statement B, often represented as \u00acB.)\n\nUsing the first statement, we know that if Mary was at the wedding (A), then Sue must be at the wedding (B). However, the second statement tells us that Sue was not at the wedding (\u00acB). \n\nSince we know that Sue was not at the wedding, and the first statement says that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must be at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary must not have been at the wedding. This is because if Mary were at the wedding, Sue would have to be at the wedding as well, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
