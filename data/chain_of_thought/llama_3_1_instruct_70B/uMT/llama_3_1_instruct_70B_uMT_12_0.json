            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This statement implies that if the condition (Joe going to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true. However, the second statement contradicts the consequence, stating that Lucy did not go to the zoo. \n\nGiven that the consequence (Lucy going to the zoo) is false, we can infer that the condition (Joe going to the park) must also be false. This is because if the condition were true, the consequence would also be true, according to the first statement. Since the consequence is false, we can conclude that the condition is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
