            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This statement implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, it does not provide any information about the doll's material if the truck is not metal.\n\nThe second statement is a simple assertion: \"The truck was not metal.\" This statement tells us that the truck is not made of metal.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements. Since the truck is not metal, we can use the first statement to infer something about the doll. However, the first statement only tells us what would happen if the doll is plastic (i.e., the truck would be metal). It does not provide any information about what would happen if the doll is not plastic.\n\nIn other words, the first statement only provides a one-way implication: if the doll is plastic, then the truck is metal. It does not provide a converse implication: if the truck is not metal, then the doll is not plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic. The doll could be plastic, and the first statement would simply be false in this case. Alternatively, the doll could be made of some other material, and the first statement would be irrelevant.\n\nAnswer: no",
