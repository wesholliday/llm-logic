            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or A \u2192 B. The second statement is \"Erin did not take a train,\" which can be represented as \u00acB (not B). \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true and the consequence (B) is false, we can conclude that the condition (A) is false. This is known as the modus tollens rule of inference. In this case, we know that Erin did not take a train (\u00acB), so if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" (A) were true, it would lead to a false consequence (Erin took a train). Therefore, we can conclude that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
