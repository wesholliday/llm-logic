The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the robot did not visit Jupiter. Now, let's analyze statement 1. It says that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, we already know that the robot did not visit Jupiter. This means that the condition \"the alien visited Mars\" cannot be true, because if it were true, then the robot would have visited Jupiter, which contradicts statement 2.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars, because if it had, the robot would have visited Jupiter, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
