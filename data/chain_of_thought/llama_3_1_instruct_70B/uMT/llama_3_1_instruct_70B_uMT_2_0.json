            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical approach. The first statement says that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest. This is a conditional statement, often represented as \"if A, then B\" or A \u2192 B, where A is the griffin being in the forest and B is the unicorn being in the forest.\n\nThe second statement says that the unicorn was not in the forest, which is the negation of B, often represented as \u00acB.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA. In this case, if the griffin being in the forest implies the unicorn being in the forest, and the unicorn was not in the forest, then we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
