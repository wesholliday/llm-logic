            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This statement implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, it does not provide any information about the pants if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nThe second statement is a simple negation: \"The pants were not denim.\" This statement tells us that the pants are definitely not denim.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements. If the pants are not denim, and we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim, then we can conclude that the shirt cannot be cotton. This is because if the shirt were cotton, the pants would have to be denim, but we know they are not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
