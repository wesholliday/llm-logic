            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements and apply logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This statement implies that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that the consequence will be true if the condition is false.\n\nThe second statement is a negation of the consequence: \"The banana was not yellow.\" This statement tells us that the consequence of the first statement is false.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between the condition and the consequence. If the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must be true. However, since we know that the consequence is false (the banana was not yellow), we can infer that the condition (the apple being red) cannot be true. This is because if the condition were true, the consequence would also be true, which contradicts the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
