            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical approach. The given statements are: \n1. If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. (This is a conditional statement, often represented as 'If A, then B' or A \u2192 B.)\n2. Amy did not play tennis. (This is a negation of the statement 'Amy played tennis', often represented as \u00acB.)\n\nUsing the first statement, we know that if Jeff played basketball (A), then Amy played tennis (B). However, the second statement tells us that Amy did not play tennis (\u00acB). \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the consequence (B) is false, we cannot directly conclude that the antecedent (A) is false. However, we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement to make an inference. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A' (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA). \n\nApplying the contrapositive to our problem, we get: If Amy did not play tennis (\u00acB), then Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acA). Since we know Amy did not play tennis (\u00acB), we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
