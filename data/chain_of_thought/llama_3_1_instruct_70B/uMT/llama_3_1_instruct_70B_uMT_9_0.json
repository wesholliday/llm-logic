            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement implies that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the condition is false.\n\nThe second statement is a negation of the consequence: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" Since we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we can infer that the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) must be false. This is because if the condition were true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) would also be true, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
