            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical argument. The first statement says that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, often represented as \"if A, then B\" or A \u2192 B, where A is the condition (the book was written by James) and B is the consequence (the book is a mystery novel). The second statement says that the book is not a mystery novel, which is the negation of B (\u00acB). \n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA. In this case, if the book was written by James (A), then it is a mystery novel (B), and we know that the book is not a mystery novel (\u00acB). Therefore, we can conclude that the book was not written by James (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
