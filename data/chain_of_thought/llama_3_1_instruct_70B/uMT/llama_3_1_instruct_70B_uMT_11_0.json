            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This statement implies that if the cake is indeed chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, it does not provide any information about the cake's flavor if the muffins are not blueberry.\n\nThe second statement is a simple negation: \"The muffins were not blueberry.\" This statement tells us that the muffins are definitely not blueberry.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements. Since the muffins are not blueberry, we cannot directly infer the flavor of the cake from the first statement. However, we can use a process called \"modus tollens\" to make an inference. Modus tollens is a logical rule that states: \"If A implies B, and B is false, then A is false.\" In this case, A is \"the cake was chocolate,\" and B is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" Since we know that B is false (the muffins were not blueberry), we can conclude that A is also false (the cake was not chocolate).\n\nAnswer: yes",
