            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical approach. We are given two statements: \n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake. \n2. The mummy was not awake.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that the vampire's wakefulness is a sufficient condition for the mummy's wakefulness. However, it does not guarantee that the vampire's wakefulness is the only condition for the mummy's wakefulness. \n\nThe second statement tells us that the mummy was not awake. Since the mummy's wakefulness is dependent on the vampire's wakefulness (as per the first statement), we can infer that the vampire's wakefulness would have led to the mummy's wakefulness. However, since the mummy was not awake, it is possible that the vampire was not awake, but it is not the only possibility.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we can see that the first statement is a conditional statement (if-then statement). In a conditional statement, if the consequent (the mummy was awake) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (the vampire was awake) is also false. This is because if the antecedent were true, the consequent would also be true, given the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
