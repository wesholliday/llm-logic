To determine if we can infer 'The flibbit must be quibble crunk and snork zooble wozzle', we need to analyze the original statement. The original statement contains two clauses: 'The flibbit must be quibble crunk' and 'it must snork zooble wozzle'. The word 'it' in the second clause is likely referring to 'The flibbit' from the first clause. If we replace 'it' with 'The flibbit', the statement becomes 'The flibbit must be quibble crunk and The flibbit must snork zooble wozzle'. This is logically equivalent to the statement 'The flibbit must be quibble crunk and snork zooble wozzle', as the subject 'The flibbit' is implied in the second part of the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
