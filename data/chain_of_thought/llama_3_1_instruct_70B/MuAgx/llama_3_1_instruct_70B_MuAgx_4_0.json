            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The quorple must be at snork gribble and it must be in the wibble plonk' is a compound sentence consisting of two independent clauses joined by 'and'. The first clause is 'The quorple must be at snork gribble', and the second clause is 'it must be in the wibble plonk'. The pronoun 'it' in the second clause refers back to 'The quorple' in the first clause. \n\nThe proposed inference 'The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk' is a single sentence with a compound predicate. This sentence also conveys the same meaning as the original statement, with 'The quorple' being the subject and 'must be at snork gribble' and 'in the wibble plonk' being the two predicates joined by 'and'. \n\nSince the original statement and the proposed inference convey the same meaning, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
