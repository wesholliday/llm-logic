To infer 'The wobble must be wumble fizzle and frazzle at wozzle zump', we need to determine if the information in the original statement is sufficient to support the inferred statement. \n\nThe original statement contains two clauses: 'The wobble must be wumble fizzle' and 'it must frazzle at wozzle zump'. The word 'it' in the second clause likely refers to 'The wobble' from the first clause. If we combine these two clauses, we can infer that 'The wobble must be wumble fizzle and frazzle at wozzle zump'. The word 'must' is applied to both clauses in the original statement, so it's reasonable to assume that both conditions apply to 'The wobble'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
