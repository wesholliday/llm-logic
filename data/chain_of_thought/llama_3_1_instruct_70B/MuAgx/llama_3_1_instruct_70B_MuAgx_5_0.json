To infer 'The zump must be zibber fizzle and quork for', we need to determine if the meaning remains the same after removing the word 'it'. \n\nIn this case, 'it' is a pronoun referring to 'The zump'. Removing 'it' and the word 'must be' that follows it, we are left with 'The zump must be zibber fizzle and quork for'. The meaning of the original statement is preserved, as 'The zump' is still the subject of both clauses.\n\nAnswer: yes",
