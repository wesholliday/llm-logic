The first statement 'Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled' can be represented as 'A or B', where A is 'the flob must be movated' and B is 'it is skizzled'. The second statement 'It's not the case that the flob must be movated' can be represented as 'not A'. \n\nIn a logical 'or' statement, if one of the conditions is false, the other condition must be true for the entire statement to be true. Since we know 'not A' is true, we can infer that 'A or B' is true only if B is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
