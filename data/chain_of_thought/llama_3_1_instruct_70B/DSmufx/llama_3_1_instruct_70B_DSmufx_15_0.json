            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements and apply basic logical rules. The first statement is 'Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed', which can be represented as 'A or B' where A is 'the dreb must be spened' and B is 'it is vroombed'. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the dreb must be spened', which can be represented as 'not A'.\n\nUsing the rule of disjunctive syllogism, if we have 'A or B' and 'not A', we can infer 'B'. This is because if A is not true, then the only way 'A or B' can be true is if B is true.\n\nIn this case, we have 'A or B' (Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed) and 'not A' (It's not the case that the dreb must be spened). Applying the rule of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer 'B', which is 'The dreb is vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
