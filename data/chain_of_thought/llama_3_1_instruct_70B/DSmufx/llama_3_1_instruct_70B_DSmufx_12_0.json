The first statement is 'Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped'. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the smip must be lupped', which is the negation of the first condition in the disjunction.\n\nGiven that the first condition is negated, we can no longer consider it as a possibility. However, the disjunction still holds true, and since the first condition is false, the second condition must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
