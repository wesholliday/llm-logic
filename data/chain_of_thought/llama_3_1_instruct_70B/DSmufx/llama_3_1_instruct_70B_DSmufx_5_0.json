The first statement 'Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled' can be represented as 'A or B', where A is 'the zinger must be smoogled' and B is 'the zinger is fraggled'. The second statement 'It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled' can be represented as 'not A'. \n\nIn a logical 'or' statement, if one of the conditions is false, the other condition must be true for the entire statement to be true. Since we know 'not A' is true, we can infer that B must be true for the first statement to hold true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
