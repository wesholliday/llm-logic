            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat is morphed', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked' is a negation of the first condition in the disjunction.\n\nGiven that the first condition is negated, we can eliminate it as a possibility. Since the disjunction states that at least one of the conditions must be true, and the first condition is not true, the second condition 'it is morphed' must be true in order for the disjunction to hold.\n\nAnswer: yes",
