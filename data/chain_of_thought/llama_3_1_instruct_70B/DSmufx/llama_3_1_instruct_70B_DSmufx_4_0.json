The first statement is 'Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled'. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked', which is the negation of the first condition in the disjunction.\n\nGiven that the first condition is negated, we can no longer consider it as a possibility. However, the disjunction still holds true, and since the first condition is false, the second condition must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
