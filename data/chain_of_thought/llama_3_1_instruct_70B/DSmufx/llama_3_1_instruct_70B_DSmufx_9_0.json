The first statement is 'Either the twonk must be varnished or it is plinked'. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked', which is the negation of 'The twonk must be plinked'. \n\nFrom the second statement, we can conclude that 'The twonk must be plinked' is false. Now, considering the first statement, since 'The twonk must be plinked' is false, the only way for the disjunction to be true is if 'The twonk must be varnished' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
