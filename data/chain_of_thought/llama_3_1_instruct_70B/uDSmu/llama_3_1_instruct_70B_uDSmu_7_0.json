This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true.\n2. It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet. This statement negates the second option from the first statement.\n\nGiven that the second option (the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet) is negated, we can infer that the first option (the umbrella is in the car) is the only remaining possibility. This is because the first statement established that at least one of the two options must be true, and since the second option is negated, the first option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
