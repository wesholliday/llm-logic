This is a classic example of an 'or' statement in logic, where if one option is not true, the other option must be true. Additionally, we are told that it's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet. This means that the option of the jacket hanging in the closet is not necessarily true. \n\nGiven that the jacket must be in one of the two locations, and it's not necessarily hanging in the closet, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
