The pen is either in the bag or on the desk (this is an 'or' statement, meaning it could be in one place or the other, but not necessarily both).\n2. It's not the case that the pen must be on the desk (this statement rules out the necessity of the pen being on the desk, but it doesn't rule out the possibility of it being on the desk).\n\nHowever, since we know it's either in the bag or on the desk, and it's not necessarily on the desk, we can infer that the pen is in the bag. This is because the only other option (being on the desk) is not a necessity, and we have no other information suggesting it's anywhere else.\n\nAnswer: yes",
