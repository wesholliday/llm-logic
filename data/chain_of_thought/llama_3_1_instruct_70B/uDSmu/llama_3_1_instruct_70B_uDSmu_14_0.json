It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have two possibilities: the milk is on the counter, or it must be chilling in the fridge. The second statement eliminates the possibility that the milk must be chilling in the fridge. \n\nSince the first statement presents an 'either-or' situation and the second statement eliminates one of the options, we can conclude that the remaining option is the only possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
