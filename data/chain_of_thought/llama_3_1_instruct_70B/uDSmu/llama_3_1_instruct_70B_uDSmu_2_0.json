This is a disjunction (an 'or' statement) and implies that the book can be in one of these two locations.\n2. It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table. This statement negates the necessity of the book being on the table, but it does not negate the possibility of the book being on the table.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can infer that since the book must be in one of the two locations (shelf or table) and it's not necessarily on the table, the only other option is that it is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
