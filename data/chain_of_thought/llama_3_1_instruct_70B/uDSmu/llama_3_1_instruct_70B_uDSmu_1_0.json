This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. \n2. It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This statement negates the second option in the disjunction.\n\nGiven that the second option (Fido must be in the garden) is negated, we can conclude that the first option (Fido is inside) must be true, as the disjunction requires at least one of the options to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
