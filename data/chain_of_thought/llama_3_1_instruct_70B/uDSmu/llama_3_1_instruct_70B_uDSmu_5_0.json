This is a classic 'or' statement, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. \n2. It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This statement negates the second condition of the 'or' statement.\n\nGiven that the second condition is negated, we can infer that the first condition must be true, as the 'or' statement requires at least one of the conditions to be true. Therefore, we can conclude that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
