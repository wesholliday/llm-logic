            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of a modus tollens argument, but with a negated antecedent. The general form of the argument is: \n\nIf A, then B\nNot A\n\u2234 Not B\n\nHowever, this form is not logically valid. The correct form of modus tollens is:\n\nIf A, then B\nNot B\n\u2234 Not A\n\nIn the given argument, the conclusion 'Lucy did not go to the zoo' does not logically follow from the premises 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' and 'Joe did not go to the park'. The conclusion is trying to make an inference about Lucy's actions based on the negation of the antecedent (Joe not going to the park), but this is not a valid logical step.\n\nAnswer: No",
