            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) and a negation of the antecedent (the 'if' part). The argument is as follows:\n\n1. If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n2. Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n3. Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nThis argument is an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The first premise only tells us what would happen if Lisa bought the red shirt, but it does not provide any information about what would happen if she did not buy the red shirt. The second premise tells us that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but it does not provide any information about Mark's actions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
