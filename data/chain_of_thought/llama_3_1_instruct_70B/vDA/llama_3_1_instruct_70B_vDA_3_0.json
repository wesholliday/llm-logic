            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of a modus tollens argument, but with a negated antecedent in the second premise. The first premise is a conditional statement 'If A, then B' (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel), and the second premise is the negation of the antecedent 'not A' (The book was not written by James). However, the conclusion drawn is 'not B' (The book is not a mystery novel), which is not a logically valid conclusion from the given premises.\n\nIn a modus tollens argument, the conclusion should be drawn when the antecedent is negated, but the conclusion should be the negation of the consequent only if the conditional statement is a biconditional (i.e., 'if and only if'). In this case, the conditional statement is not a biconditional, and the conclusion 'The book is not a mystery novel' does not logically follow from the given premises. The book could still be a mystery novel even if it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
