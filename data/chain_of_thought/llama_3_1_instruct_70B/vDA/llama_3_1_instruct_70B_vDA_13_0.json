            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of a syllogism, specifically a modus tollens argument. The modus tollens form is as follows: \n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not P\n3. \u2234 Not Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'the car was red', and Q is 'the truck was blue'. The argument follows the modus tollens form. However, modus tollens is a valid argument form only when the negation of the consequent (Q) is inferred from the negation of the antecedent (P) in a conditional statement. In this case, the conclusion 'The truck was not blue' is inferred from the negation of the antecedent 'The car was not red'. \n\nHowever, the conclusion 'The truck was not blue' is not logically guaranteed by the premises. The first premise only states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, but it does not provide any information about the color of the truck if the car is not red. The truck could still be blue even if the car is not red. Therefore, the conclusion 'The truck was not blue' is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
