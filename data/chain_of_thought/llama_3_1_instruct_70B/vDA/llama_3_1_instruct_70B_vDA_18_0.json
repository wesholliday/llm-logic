            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is as follows:\n\n1. If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n2. The doll was not plastic.\n3. Therefore, the truck was not metal.\n\nThis argument can be represented using propositional logic as follows:\n\n1. P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n2. \u00acP (Not P)\n3. \u2234 \u00acQ (Therefore, not Q)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens\" when the conclusion is Q, but in this case, the conclusion is \u00acQ. However, the correct conclusion for modus tollens would be \u00acQ if the first premise was Q \u2192 P and the second premise was \u00acQ. \n\nIn this case, the argument is actually an example of the fallacy of \"denying the antecedent.\" The correct conclusion from the premises would be that we cannot determine the material of the truck, as the first premise only tells us what would happen if the doll was plastic, but it does not provide any information about what would happen if the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: no",
