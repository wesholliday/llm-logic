            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. The first premise is a conditional statement: 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This can be represented as 'B \u2192 T', where 'B' represents 'Jeff played basketball' and 'T' represents 'Amy played tennis'. The second premise is the negation of the antecedent (the 'if' part) of the conditional statement: 'Jeff did not play basketball', which can be represented as '\u00acB'. \n\nThe conclusion is 'Amy did not play tennis', which can be represented as '\u00acT'. \n\nIn a logically valid argument, the conclusion must follow necessarily from the premises. In this case, we have a conditional statement and the negation of its antecedent. However, the negation of the antecedent does not logically imply the negation of the consequent (the 'then' part). This is a classic example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent. \n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
