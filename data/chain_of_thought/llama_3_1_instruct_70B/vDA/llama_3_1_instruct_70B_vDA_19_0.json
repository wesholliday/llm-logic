            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement (if-then) and its negation. The first premise is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', which can be represented as 'If A, then B'. The second premise is 'Tom did not watch football', which is the negation of A, denoted as 'not A'. The conclusion is 'Jen did not watch basketball', which is the negation of B, denoted as 'not B'.\n\nIn a logically valid argument, the conclusion must follow necessarily from the premises. However, in this case, the conclusion 'not B' does not necessarily follow from 'not A'. The first premise only states that if A is true, then B is true, but it does not guarantee that if A is false, then B is false. There are cases where A is false, but B is still true.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where Tom did not watch football, but Jen still watched basketball. This scenario does not contradict the first premise, but it contradicts the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
