            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of a syllogism, specifically a modus tollens argument. The modus tollens form is: 'If A, then B; not A; therefore, not B'. \n\nHowever, the given argument is actually in the form of 'If A, then B; not A; therefore, not B', which is a fallacy known as 'denying the antecedent'. This form is not logically valid because it does not follow that 'not B' is true just because 'A' is not true. There could be other reasons why 'B' is true, even if 'A' is not.\n\nIn this specific case, the argument is saying that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, just because the shirt was not cotton, it does not necessarily mean that the pants were not denim. The pants could still be denim even if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
