            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is in the form of a syllogism, specifically a modus tollens argument. The modus tollens form is as follows: \n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not P\n3. Therefore, not Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'the alien visited Mars', and Q is 'the robot visited Jupiter'. The argument follows the modus tollens form exactly. \n\nModus tollens is a valid form of argument in classical logic. This means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
