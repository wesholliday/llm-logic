            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of a syllogism, specifically a modus tollens argument. However, the given argument is not a perfect modus tollens. A modus tollens argument has the form: 'If A, then B; Not A; Therefore, Not B'. \n\nIn this case, the first premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', which can be represented as 'If A, then B'. The second premise is 'The apple was not red', which can be represented as 'Not A'. However, the conclusion 'The banana was not yellow' is 'Not B', but it does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nThe correct conclusion from the premises 'If A, then B' and 'Not A' is actually 'We cannot determine the truth value of B', not 'Not B'. This is because 'If A, then B' only guarantees the truth of B when A is true, but it does not provide any information about the truth value of B when A is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
