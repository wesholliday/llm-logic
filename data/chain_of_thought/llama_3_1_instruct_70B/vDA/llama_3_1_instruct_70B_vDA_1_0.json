            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of a syllogism, specifically a modus tollens argument. The first premise is a conditional statement 'If A, then B', where A is 'Mary was at the wedding' and B is 'Sue was at the wedding'. The second premise is the negation of the antecedent (A), 'Mary was not at the wedding'. \n\nIn a modus tollens argument, if the antecedent (A) is negated, and the conditional statement 'If A, then B' is true, we can logically conclude that the consequent (B) is also negated. However, in this case, the conclusion 'Sue was not at the wedding' is the negation of the consequent (B), but the argument is actually an example of denying the antecedent, which is not a logically valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: no",
