            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of a syllogism, specifically a modus tollens argument. The first premise is a conditional statement (if-then statement), the second premise is the negation of the antecedent (the 'if' part), and the conclusion is the negation of the consequent (the 'then' part). \n\nThe general form of modus tollens is: \n1. If A, then B\n2. Not A\n3. Therefore, Not B\n\nIn this case, A is 'the vampire was awake', and B is 'the mummy was awake'. The argument follows the modus tollens form exactly. Modus tollens is a logically valid argument form, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
