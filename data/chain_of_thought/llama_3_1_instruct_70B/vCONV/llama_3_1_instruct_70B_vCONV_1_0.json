            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding\"). The conclusion is also a conditional statement, but with the order of A and B reversed: \"If B, then A\".\n\nIn logic, this type of argument is known as \"converse error\" or \"affirming the converse\". The premise does not logically guarantee the conclusion. Just because the presence of Mary implies the presence of Sue, it does not necessarily mean that the presence of Sue implies the presence of Mary. There could be cases where Sue is at the wedding without Mary being there.\n\nFor example, consider a scenario where Sue is a close friend of the groom, while Mary is a friend of Sue's who only attends events if Sue is also attending. In this case, the premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" is true, but the conclusion \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" is not necessarily true, since Sue could have attended the wedding without Mary.\n\nAnswer: No",
