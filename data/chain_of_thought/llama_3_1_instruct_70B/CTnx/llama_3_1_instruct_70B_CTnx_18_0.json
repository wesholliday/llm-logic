The statement we are trying to infer is in the form of 'If B, then not A'. \n\nThis is a classic example of the contrapositive form in logic. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, the contrapositive of 'If A, then not B' is 'If B, then not A'. \n\nSince the given statement is 'If A, then not B', we can indeed infer 'If B, then not A', which is 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
