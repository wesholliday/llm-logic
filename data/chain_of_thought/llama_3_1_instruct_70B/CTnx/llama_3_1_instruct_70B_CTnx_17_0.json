            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the given statement, we need to analyze the original statement and apply logical reasoning. The original statement is 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated'. This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then not B', where A is 'the flob was skizzled' and B is 'the flob movated'.\n\nWe can rewrite the original statement as 'If A, then not B'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If B, then not A', which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is obtained by swapping the two clauses and negating both.\n\nApplying this to the original statement, we get 'If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled', which is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
