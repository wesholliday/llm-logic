This statement implies that vroombed and spened are mutually exclusive, meaning that if one is true, the other must be false.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily imply the converse, which is 'If B, then not A'. The converse would be 'If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed'. While it is possible that the converse is true, it is not logically guaranteed by the original statement.\n\nIn other words, just because being vroombed implies not being spened, it does not necessarily mean that being spened implies not being vroombed. There could be cases where the dreb is neither vroombed nor spened, or cases where the dreb can be both vroombed and spened, but the original statement does not provide enough information to rule out these possibilities.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
