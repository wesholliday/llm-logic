            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed' from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. \n\nThe original statement is in the form 'If A, then not B', where A is 'the splat was morphed' and B is 'the splat quank'. \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is in the form 'If B, then not A'. This is a classic example of the contrapositive form in logic. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we are dealing with 'If A, then not B', so the contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A'. \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed' from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
