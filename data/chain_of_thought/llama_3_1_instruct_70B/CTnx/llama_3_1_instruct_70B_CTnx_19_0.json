            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the given statement, we need to analyze the original statement and apply logical reasoning. The original statement is 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then not B', where A is 'the smonk was vreebled' and B is 'the smonk plagged'.\n\nTo infer the new statement 'If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled', we need to apply the rule of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we have 'If A, then not B', so the contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A'.\n\nApplying this rule to the original statement, we can indeed infer that 'If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled', as it is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
