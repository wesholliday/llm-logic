            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the given statement, we need to analyze the original statement and the statement we are trying to infer. The original statement is 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink'. This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then not B'. \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is 'If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed'. This is also a conditional statement, but in the form 'If B, then not A'. \n\nIn logic, this type of inference is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we have 'If A, then not B', and we are trying to infer 'If B, then not A', which is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
