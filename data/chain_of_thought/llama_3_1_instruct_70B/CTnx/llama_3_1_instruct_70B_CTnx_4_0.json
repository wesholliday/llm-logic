            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled' from 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. \n\nThe original statement is in the form of 'If A, then not B', where A is 'the fribble was snurgled' and B is 'the fribble crink'. \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is in the form of 'If B, then not A'. This is a classic example of the contrapositive of the original statement. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we have 'If A, then not B', so the contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A'. \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled' from 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
