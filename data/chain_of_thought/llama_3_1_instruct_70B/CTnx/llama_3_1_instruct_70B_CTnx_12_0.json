            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the given statement, we need to analyze the original statement and apply logical reasoning. The original statement is 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint'. This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then not B', where A is 'the smip was shripped' and B is 'the smip lupped the zoint'.\n\nTo infer the new statement 'If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped', we need to apply the rule of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. In this case, the contrapositive of 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint' would be 'If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped'.\n\nSince the new statement is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement, we can infer it logically.\n\nAnswer: yes",
