This is a classic example of the contrapositive form, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we are dealing with 'If A, then not B', so the contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A'. \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked' from 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
