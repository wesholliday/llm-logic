            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked', we need to examine the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' is of the form 'If B, then not A'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this case, we are looking at the converse of the contrapositive, which is actually the contrapositive of the original statement. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
