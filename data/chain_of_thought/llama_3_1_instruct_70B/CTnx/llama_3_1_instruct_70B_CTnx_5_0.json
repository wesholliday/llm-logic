            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled', we need to check if this new statement logically follows from the original statement.\n\nThe new statement is of the form 'If B, then not A'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, the contrapositive of 'If A, then not B' is indeed 'If B, then not A'. Since the new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, it is logically equivalent and can be inferred.\n\nAnswer: yes",
