            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered' from 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn', we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statement. The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then not B', where A is 'the fleeg was bluttered' and B is 'it surned'. \n\nThe proposed inference is in the form of 'If B, then not A'. This is a classic example of the logical rule of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of a statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we are dealing with 'If A, then not B', and its contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A'. \n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered' from 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
