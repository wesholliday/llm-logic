            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the given statement, we need to analyze the original statement and apply logical reasoning. The original statement is 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink'. This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then not B', where A is 'the sneg was crampled' and B is 'the sneg sproted the frink'.\n\nTo infer the new statement 'If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled', we need to check if it is logically equivalent to the original statement. This new statement is in the form 'If B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we have 'If A, then not B', and its contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A'. Since the new statement matches this form, it is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
