            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The premise is 'If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth', which can be represented as 'D \u2192 \u00acI' (where 'D' represents 'the issue was discussed' and 'I' represents 'the issue was discussed in depth'). The conclusion is 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed', which can be represented as 'I \u2192 \u00acD'.\n\nWe can examine the validity of the argument by checking if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The argument is attempting to establish a contrapositive relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The contrapositive of 'D \u2192 \u00acI' is indeed 'I \u2192 \u00acD', which is the conclusion.\n\nHowever, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but this does not necessarily mean that the argument is valid. The issue here is that the argument is trying to establish a contrapositive relationship between the premise and the conclusion, but it is not a direct contrapositive. The original statement 'D \u2192 \u00acI' is not logically equivalent to 'I \u2192 \u00acD' in the context of the argument.\n\nA more accurate analysis would be to consider the relationship between the statements. If 'D \u2192 \u00acI' is true, it means that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth. However, this does not necessarily imply that if the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed. The conclusion 'I \u2192 \u00acD' is not a logical consequence of the premise 'D \u2192 \u00acI'.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
