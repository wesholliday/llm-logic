            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The premise is 'If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently', which can be represented as 'S \u2192 \u00acD', where 'S' represents 'Ben studied' and 'D' represents 'Ben studied diligently'. The conclusion is 'If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study', which can be represented as 'D \u2192 \u00acS'.\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we can use a truth table or logical rules. However, a more intuitive approach is to recognize that the argument is an example of a logical fallacy called 'denying the antecedent'. The premise states that if Ben studied, then he did not study diligently, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Ben did study diligently. The conclusion, however, assumes that if Ben studied diligently, then he did not study, which is not logically supported by the premise.\n\nIn general, the form of the argument is 'A \u2192 \u00acB, therefore B \u2192 \u00acA', which is not a logically valid form. This can be seen by considering a counterexample: 'If it is raining, then the streets are not dry' does not logically imply 'If the streets are dry, then it is not raining'.\n\nAnswer: no",
