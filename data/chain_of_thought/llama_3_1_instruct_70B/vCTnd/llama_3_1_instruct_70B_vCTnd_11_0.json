            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables', which can be represented as 'A \u2192 \u00acB', where A is 'I went to the store' and B is 'I bought vegetables'. The conclusion is 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store', which can be represented as 'B \u2192 \u00acA'.\n\nThe argument is essentially trying to establish a relationship between A and B. The premise states that if A is true, then B is false (A \u2192 \u00acB). The conclusion states that if B is true, then A is false (B \u2192 \u00acA). This is a classic example of the contrapositive form of argument.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement 'A \u2192 B' is '\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA'. In this case, the contrapositive of 'A \u2192 \u00acB' is indeed 'B \u2192 \u00acA'. Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
