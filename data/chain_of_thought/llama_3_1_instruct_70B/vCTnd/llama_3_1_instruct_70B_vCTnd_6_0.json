            "content": "Explanation: To determine the logical validity of the argument, we need to analyze its form. The premise is 'If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly', which can be represented as 'W \u2192 \u00acP', where 'W' represents 'the clothes were washed' and 'P' represents 'the clothes were washed properly'. The conclusion is 'If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed', which can be represented as 'P \u2192 \u00acW'.\n\nThe argument form is as follows:\n\nW \u2192 \u00acP\n\u2234 P \u2192 \u00acW\n\nThis argument form is an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent. However, in this case, it's actually a valid form of argument, known as contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of 'W \u2192 \u00acP' is indeed 'P \u2192 \u00acW'. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, and the argument form is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
