            "content": "Explanation: To determine the logical validity of the argument, we need to analyze its form. The premise is 'If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice', which can be represented as 'A \u2192 \u00acH', where 'A' represents 'advice was offered' and 'H' represents 'helpful advice was offered'. The conclusion is 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered', which can be represented as 'H \u2192 \u00acA'.\n\nThe argument form is:\n\nA \u2192 \u00acH\n\u2234 H \u2192 \u00acA\n\nThis argument form is an example of the contrapositive form, which is a logically valid form of argument. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'A \u2192 B' is '\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA'. In this case, the contrapositive of 'A \u2192 \u00acH' is 'H \u2192 \u00acA', which matches the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
