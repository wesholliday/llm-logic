            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The premise is 'If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly', which can be represented as 'C \u2192 \u00acT' (where 'C' represents 'the room was cleaned' and 'T' represents 'the room was cleaned thoroughly'). The conclusion is 'If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned', which can be represented as 'T \u2192 \u00acC'.\n\nWe can examine the validity of the argument by checking if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The premise states that if the room was cleaned, it was not cleaned thoroughly. However, this does not necessarily imply that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, it was not cleaned. The premise and conclusion are related but not logically equivalent.\n\nTo test the validity, we can try to find a counterexample. Suppose the room was indeed cleaned thoroughly. This would mean that the premise 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is not applicable in this case, as 'C' (the room was cleaned) is true and '\u00acT' (the room was not cleaned thoroughly) is false. However, this does not necessarily make the conclusion 'T \u2192 \u00acC' true. In fact, if the room was cleaned thoroughly, it is still possible that the room was cleaned.\n\nAnother way to analyze this is to consider the contrapositive of the premise, which is 'T \u2192 \u00acC'. If the premise were 'C \u2192 \u00acT', its contrapositive would be 'T \u2192 \u00acC', but the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually 'T \u2192 \u00acC', which is the conclusion. However, the contrapositive of the premise is not the same as the conclusion in this case, since the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac\u00acT \u2192 \u00acC' or 'T \u2192 \u00acC' is not the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT', the contrapositive of 'C \u2192 \u00acT' is actually '\u00ac",
