            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The premise is 'If it's raining, then it's not raining hard', which can be represented as 'R \u2192 \u00acH', where 'R' represents 'it's raining' and 'H' represents 'it's raining hard'. The conclusion is 'If it's raining hard, then it's not raining', which can be represented as 'H \u2192 \u00acR'.\n\nThe argument form is:\n\nR \u2192 \u00acH\n\u2234 H \u2192 \u00acR\n\nThis argument form is an example of the 'converse' of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of 'R \u2192 \u00acH' would be 'H \u2192 \u00acR', but the given conclusion is indeed the converse of the contrapositive of the premise. However, the contrapositive of the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the contrapositive of 'H \u2192 \u00acR' would be 'R \u2192 \u00acH', which is the original premise.\n\nHowever, the given conclusion 'H \u2192 \u00acR' is not logically equivalent to the original premise 'R \u2192 \u00acH'. The argument form is not logically valid because it does not follow a valid logical rule of inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
