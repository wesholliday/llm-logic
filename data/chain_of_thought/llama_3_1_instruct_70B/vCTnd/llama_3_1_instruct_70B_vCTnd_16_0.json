            "content": "Explanation: To determine the logical validity of the argument, we need to analyze its form. The premise is 'If the job was completed, then it was not completed well', which can be represented as 'C \u2192 \u00acW' (where 'C' represents 'the job was completed' and 'W' represents 'the job was completed well'). The conclusion is 'If the job was completed well, then it was not completed', which can be represented as 'W \u2192 \u00acC'.\n\nThe argument form is:\n\nC \u2192 \u00acW\n\u2234 W \u2192 \u00acC\n\nThis argument form is an example of the contrapositive form, which is a logically valid form of argument. The contrapositive form states that if 'A \u2192 B', then '\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA'. In this case, we can rewrite the premise as 'W \u2192 \u00acC' (by contrapositive) and then negate the conclusion to get '\u00acW \u2192 \u00ac\u00acC', which is logically equivalent to '\u00acW \u2192 C'. However, the original conclusion 'W \u2192 \u00acC' is indeed the contrapositive of the premise 'C \u2192 \u00acW'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
