            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The keys must have been in the drawer or on the hook' implies that the keys were definitely in one of the two locations. This is a disjunction, where 'or' is used to indicate that at least one of the options is true. The phrase 'must have been' indicates a necessity or obligation, implying that the keys were definitely in one of the locations.\n\nWhen we break down the original statement into 'The keys must have been in the drawer or they must have been on the hook', we are essentially distributing the 'must have been' to both options. This distribution is logically equivalent to the original statement, as it still implies that the keys were definitely in one of the two locations.\n\nAnswer: yes",
