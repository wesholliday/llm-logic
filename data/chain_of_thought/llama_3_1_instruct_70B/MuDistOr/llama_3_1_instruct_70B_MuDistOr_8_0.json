            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The document must have been signed or notarized' implies that the document needs to meet one of the two conditions (signed or notarized) to be valid. This is a disjunction, where 'or' is used to indicate that either condition is sufficient. The statement does not imply that both conditions must be met, but rather that at least one of them must be met.\n\nIn the inferred statement 'The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized', the word 'must' is applied to both conditions separately, which changes the meaning. This statement implies that the document must meet at least one of the conditions, but it also implies that each condition individually is a requirement.\n\nHowever, the original statement and the inferred statement are logically equivalent. The original statement implies that the document is valid if it is signed, and it is also valid if it is notarized. The inferred statement also implies the same thing, just with a different wording.\n\nAnswer: yes",
