In a disjunction, the word 'or' is inclusive, meaning that either one or both of the statements can be true. The statement 'The software must have been installed on the computer or it must have been accessed through the cloud' is a restatement of the original disjunction, using the word 'it' to refer back to 'the software'. This restatement maintains the same meaning as the original statement, implying that either the software was installed on the computer or it was accessed through the cloud.\n\nAnswer: yes",
