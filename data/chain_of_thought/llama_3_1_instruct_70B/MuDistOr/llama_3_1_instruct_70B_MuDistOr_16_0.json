            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The contract must have been approved by the legal team or the CEO' implies that the contract's approval is a requirement, and this requirement can be fulfilled in two ways: either the contract was approved by the legal team or it was approved by the CEO. This is a classic example of a disjunction in logic, where 'or' is used inclusively, meaning that the contract could have been approved by either party, or even both.\n\nIn the proposed inference 'The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO', the word 'must' is applied separately to each option, which is consistent with the original statement. This inference maintains the same meaning as the original statement, emphasizing that the contract's approval is a requirement that can be fulfilled by either the legal team or the CEO.\n\nAnswer: yes",
