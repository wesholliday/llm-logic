            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be represented as follows: \n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (If A, then B, where A is 'Mary was at the wedding' and B is 'Sue was at the wedding').\n2. Mary was not at the wedding (Not A).\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical argument known as modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if we have 'If A, then B' and 'Not A', we cannot directly infer 'Not B'. However, if we have 'If A, then B' and 'Not B', we can infer 'Not A'. But in this case, we have 'If A, then B' and 'Not A', so we cannot directly infer 'Not B'. \n\nHowever, we can analyze it further. The statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding. It only tells us what happens when Mary is at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
