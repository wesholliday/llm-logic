            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was not blue', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (the car being red) is true, then the consequence (the truck being blue) is also true. However, it does not guarantee that if the condition is false, the consequence is also false. The second statement 'The car was not red' tells us that the condition is false. \n\nIn logic, this is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because the condition (the car being red) is false, we cannot conclude that the consequence (the truck being blue) is also false. The truck could still be blue, even if the car is not red. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The truck was not blue' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
