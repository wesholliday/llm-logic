Alex did not finish the race (Not A).\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Chris did not finish the race', we need to analyze the relationship between the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which only guarantees the outcome (Chris finishing the race) if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is met. However, the condition is not met, as stated in the second statement (Alex did not finish the race).\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer 'Chris did not finish the race' because the conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens when the condition is not met. The outcome (Chris finishing the race) is only guaranteed when the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, but it does not rule out the possibility of Chris finishing the race when Alex does not.\n\nAnswer: no",
