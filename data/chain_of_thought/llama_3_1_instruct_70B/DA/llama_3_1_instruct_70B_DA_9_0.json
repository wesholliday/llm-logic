            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and its negated antecedent. The first statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', which can be represented as 'If A, then B'. The second statement is 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', which is the negation of the antecedent A. \n\nIn logic, this is known as the 'modus tollens' rule, but in this case, we are actually dealing with the negation of the antecedent, not the negation of the consequent. The modus tollens rule states that if we have 'If A, then B' and 'not B', we can infer 'not A'. However, in this case, we have 'If A, then B' and 'not A', which does not directly allow us to infer 'not B'. \n\nIn fact, the correct inference from 'If A, then B' and 'not A' is that we cannot determine the truth value of B. The conditional statement 'If A, then B' only tells us what happens when A is true, but it does not provide any information about what happens when A is false. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
