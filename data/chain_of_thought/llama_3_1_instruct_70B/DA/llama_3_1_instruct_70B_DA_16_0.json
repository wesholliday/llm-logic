            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and its negation of the antecedent. The first statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' implies that if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is met, then the consequence (the pants being denim) follows. However, the second statement 'The shirt was not cotton' negates the condition. \n\nIn a conditional statement, the negation of the antecedent does not necessarily imply the negation of the consequent. This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. In other words, just because the condition (the shirt being cotton) is not met, it does not necessarily mean that the consequence (the pants being denim) is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The pants were not denim' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
