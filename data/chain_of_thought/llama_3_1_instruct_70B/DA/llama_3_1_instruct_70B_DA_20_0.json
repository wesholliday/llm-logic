            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and its negation of the antecedent. The first statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is a conditional statement where 'the apple was red' is the antecedent and 'the banana was yellow' is the consequent. The second statement 'The apple was not red' is the negation of the antecedent.\n\nIn logic, this is an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent. The negation of the antecedent does not necessarily imply the negation of the consequent. In other words, just because the antecedent is false, it does not mean the consequent is false.\n\nFor example, consider the statement 'If it is raining, then the streets are wet'. If it is not raining, it does not necessarily mean the streets are not wet. There could be other reasons why the streets are wet, such as a burst pipe or a flood.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
