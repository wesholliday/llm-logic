            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The mummy was not awake', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'V \u2192 M', where 'V' represents 'The vampire was awake' and 'M' represents 'The mummy was awake'. The second statement 'The vampire was not awake' can be represented as '\u00acV', where '\u00ac' denotes negation.\n\nUsing the rules of propositional logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if 'V \u2192 M' and '\u00acV', then we can infer '\u00acM'. In this case, '\u00acM' represents 'The mummy was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
