            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be represented as follows: \n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (If P, then Q).\n2. Sue did not choose pizza (Not P).\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Bob did not choose pasta', we need to analyze the relationship between the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which only guarantees the outcome (Bob chose pasta) if the condition (Sue chose pizza) is met. However, the second statement negates the condition (Sue did not choose pizza). \n\nIn a conditional statement, the negation of the condition does not necessarily imply the negation of the outcome. In other words, just because Sue did not choose pizza, it does not mean Bob did not choose pasta. There could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, unrelated to Sue's choice.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Bob did not choose pasta' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
