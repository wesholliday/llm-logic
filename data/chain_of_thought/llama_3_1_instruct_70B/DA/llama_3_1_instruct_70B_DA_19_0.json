            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and its negation of the antecedent. The first statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', which can be represented as 'If A, then B'. The second statement is 'Tom did not watch football', which is the negation of the antecedent 'A'. \n\nIn logic, this is an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent. The conclusion 'Jen did not watch basketball' would be a non-sequitur, as the conditional statement does not provide any information about what happens when the antecedent is false. The conditional statement only tells us what happens when the antecedent is true, but it does not rule out the possibility of the consequent being true when the antecedent is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Jen did not watch basketball' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
