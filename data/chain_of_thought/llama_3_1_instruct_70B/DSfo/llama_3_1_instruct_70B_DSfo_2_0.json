The first statement, 'The book isn't resting on the table', tells us that the book is not on the table. The second statement, 'Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf', presents two possible locations for the book: the table or the shelf. Since we know from the first statement that the book is not on the table, we can eliminate that option. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility, which is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
