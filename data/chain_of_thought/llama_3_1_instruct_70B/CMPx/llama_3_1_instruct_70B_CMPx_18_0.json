    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

However, we are given that the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, which means the condition \"blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most\" is unlikely to occur. \n\nFurthermore, the statement \"if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most\" is a conditional statement that only applies when the condition \"crongle doesn't bafwidge the most\" is true. However, we are given that the crongle likely won't bafwidge the most because the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most. This means the condition \"crongle doesn't bafwidge the most\" is likely to occur.\n\nHowever, the condition \"blimfet doesn't bafwidge the most\" is unlikely to occur. Therefore, the conditional statement \"if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most\" is not necessarily likely to be true, even though the condition \"crongle doesn't bafwidge the most\" is likely to occur.\n\nAnswer: no",
