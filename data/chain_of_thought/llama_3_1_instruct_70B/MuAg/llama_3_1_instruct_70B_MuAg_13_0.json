In logic, 'and' is a conjunction that requires both conditions to be true. Therefore, if the statement is true, it implies that both conditions are met: the movie must have been in English and it must have had subtitles. This is equivalent to saying 'The movie must have been in English and had subtitles'. The order of the conditions does not change the meaning of the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
