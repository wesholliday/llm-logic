The word 'and' is used to connect these conditions, indicating that both must be true. The statement 'The book must be on the shelf and have a red cover' is a more concise way of expressing the same idea, combining the two conditions into a single sentence. The meaning remains the same, as both statements require the book to be on the shelf and have a red cover.\n\nAnswer: yes",
