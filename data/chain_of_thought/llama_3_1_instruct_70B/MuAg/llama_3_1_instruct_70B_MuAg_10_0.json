            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The document must have been signed and it must have been notarized' implies that both conditions (being signed and being notarized) are necessary for the document. The word 'and' is used to connect the two conditions, indicating that both are required. The phrase 'it must have been notarized' specifically refers back to 'the document', so the conditions are indeed related to the same subject. Therefore, we can logically combine the two conditions into a single statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
