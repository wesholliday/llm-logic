            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The application must have been completed online and it must have included references' is a compound statement consisting of two conditions: 'The application must have been completed online' and 'it must have included references'. Both conditions are connected by 'and', which is a logical conjunction operator. This means that both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true. \n\nThe statement 'The application must have been completed online and included references' is a rephrased version of the original statement, but it still conveys the same meaning. The word 'it' in the original statement is implied in the rephrased statement, and the order of the conditions is the same. Therefore, the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
