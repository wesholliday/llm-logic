            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The concert must have been sold out and it must have started at 8 PM' is a compound statement consisting of two clauses: 'The concert must have been sold out' and 'it must have started at 8 PM'. Both clauses are connected by 'and', which is a logical conjunction. In logic, when two statements are connected by 'and', the resulting compound statement is true only if both individual statements are true. \n\nIn this case, the original statement implies that both conditions (being sold out and starting at 8 PM) must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM.\n\nAnswer: yes",
