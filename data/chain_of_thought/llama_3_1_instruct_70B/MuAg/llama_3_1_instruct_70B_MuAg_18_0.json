The word 'and' is used to connect these two conditions, indicating that both conditions must be met. The statement 'The medicine must have been taken with food and been taken twice daily' is a rephrased version of the original statement, with the same conditions and the same logical connection between them. Therefore, the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
