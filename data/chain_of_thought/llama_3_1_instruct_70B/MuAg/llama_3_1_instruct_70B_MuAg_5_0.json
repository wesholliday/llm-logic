The word 'and' is used to connect these two conditions, indicating that both must be true. The statement 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for' combines these two conditions into a single action, but the meaning remains the same - the package was delivered today and it was signed for. Therefore, the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
