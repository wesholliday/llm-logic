The word 'and' is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both conditions must be true. \n\nIn the inferred statement 'The event must have been formal and required tickets', the word 'it' is removed, but the meaning remains the same. The word 'and' still connects the two clauses, and both conditions must be true for the statement to be true. The removal of 'it' does not change the meaning of the statement, as 'required tickets' is still clearly referring to 'the event'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
