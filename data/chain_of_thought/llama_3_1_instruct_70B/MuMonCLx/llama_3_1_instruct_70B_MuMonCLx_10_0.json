The statement is a conjunction, meaning it consists of two parts connected by 'and'. In a conjunction, both parts must be true for the entire statement to be true. \n\nIf we break down the statement, we have two parts: 'The snork must be froodle' and 'The snork must be glorp'. Since the statement is a conjunction, we can infer that 'The snork must be froodle' is a necessary condition for the entire statement to be true. \n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer 'The snork must be froodle' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
