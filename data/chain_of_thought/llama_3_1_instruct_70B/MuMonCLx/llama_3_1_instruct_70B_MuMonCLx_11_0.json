The statement 'The flimble must be grazzle and zizz' is a conjunction, meaning it consists of two connected statements: 'The flimble must be grazzle' and 'The flimble must be zizz'. In a conjunction, both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true. \n\nIf we know that 'The flimble must be grazzle and zizz' is true, then we can logically conclude that 'The flimble must be grazzle' is also true, since it is one of the two statements that make up the conjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
