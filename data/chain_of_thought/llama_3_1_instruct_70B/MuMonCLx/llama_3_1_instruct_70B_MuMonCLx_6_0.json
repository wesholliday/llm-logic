The original sentence is 'The quimble must be bimboozle wobble and snizzle at crunk fizzle'. This sentence is a compound sentence, where two independent clauses are joined by 'and'. The first independent clause is 'The quimble must be bimboozle wobble', and the second independent clause is 'snizzle at crunk fizzle'. \n\nSince the first independent clause 'The quimble must be bimboozle wobble' is a part of the original sentence, we can indeed infer this statement from the given sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
