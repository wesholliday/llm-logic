            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves a disjunction (an 'or' statement) in the first premise. The general form of a disjunctive syllogism is: \n\n1. P or Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, the argument follows this form:\n\n1. The remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n2. The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n3. Therefore, The remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nThis form of argument is logically valid because if the first premise is true (the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch), and the second premise is true (the remote control isn't under the couch), then the conclusion logically follows (the remote control must be on the coffee table).\n\nAnswer: yes",
