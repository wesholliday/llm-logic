The argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves a disjunction (an \"or\" statement) and the negation of one of the disjuncts. The general form of a disjunctive syllogism is:\n\n1. P or Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, the argument follows this form:\n\n1.
