            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves a disjunction (an 'or' statement) and the negation of one of the disjuncts. The general form of a disjunctive syllogism is:\n\n1. P or Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, the argument follows this form:\n\n1. The watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\n2. The watch isn't on his wrist.\n3. Therefore, The watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nThis form of argument is logically valid because if the first premise is true (the watch is either charging on the dresser or on his wrist), and the second premise is true (the watch isn't on his wrist), then the only remaining possibility is that the watch is charging on the dresser. This conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
