            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is based on a disjunction (either/or statement) in the first premise, followed by the negation of one of the disjuncts in the second premise. The conclusion then asserts the other disjunct. \n\nThis form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism. It follows this pattern: \n1. Either A or B\n2. Not B\n3. Therefore, A\n\nIn this case, A is 'Fido is inside' and B is 'Fido is in the garden'. The argument's form matches the pattern of disjunctive syllogism, which is a logically valid form of argument. \n\nAnswer: yes",
