            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a type of argument that involves a disjunction (an 'or' statement) in the first premise. The general form of a disjunctive syllogism is: \n\n1. P or Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, the argument follows this form, with 'P' being 'The book is on the shelf' and 'Q' being 'The book is resting on the table'. The first premise states that the book is either on the shelf or on the table, and the second premise states that it is not on the table. \n\nGiven the first premise, if the book is not on the table (as stated in the second premise), then it must be on the shelf, as these are the only two options presented. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
