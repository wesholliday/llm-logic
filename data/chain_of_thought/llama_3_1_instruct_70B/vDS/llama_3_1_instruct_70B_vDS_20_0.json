The argument is in the form of a disjunctive syllogism, which is a valid form of argument. A disjunctive syllogism has the following form: \n\n1. P or Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, P\n\nIn this case, P is 'The sunglasses are in her bag' and Q is 'The sunglasses are perched on her head'. The first premise states that either P or Q is true, and the second premise states that Q is not true. From this, we can logically conclude that P must be true, since it is the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: yes",
