            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not daggled', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'A \u2192 B', where A is 'the sprocket was cranked' and B is 'the sprocket was daggled'. The second statement 'The sprocket was not cranked' is the negation of A, which can be represented as '\u00acA'. \n\nIn logic, the rule of inference we are looking for is called 'modus tollens', which states that if we have 'A \u2192 B' and '\u00acA', we can infer '\u00acB'. However, in this case, we have 'A \u2192 B' and '\u00acA', but we are trying to infer '\u00acB'. This matches the modus tollens rule, so we can indeed infer 'The sprocket was not daggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
