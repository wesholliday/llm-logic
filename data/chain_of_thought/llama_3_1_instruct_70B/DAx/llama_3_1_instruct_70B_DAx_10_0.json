            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The wug was not garpled', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B' (where A is 'the wug was sproinged' and B is 'the wug was garpled'). \n\nThe second statement 'The wug was not sproinged' is the negation of A, which can be represented as 'Not A'. \n\nIn logic, the rule of inference we are dealing with here is called 'modus tollens'. Modus tollens states that if we have 'If A, then B' and 'Not A', we cannot directly conclude 'Not B'. However, if we have 'If A, then B' and 'Not B', we can conclude 'Not A'. \n\nIn our case, we have 'If A, then B' and 'Not A', but we want to conclude 'Not B'. This is not a valid application of modus tollens. However, we can use the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that 'If A, then B' is logically equivalent to 'If Not B, then Not A'. \n\nApplying the contrapositive to the first statement, we get 'If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged'. Now, we have 'If Not B, then Not A' and 'Not A', but we still cannot directly conclude 'Not B'. \n\nHowever, we can use another rule of inference, which is the rule of contrapositive inference again, but this time applied to the contrapositive statement. This would give us 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is logically equivalent to 'If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged'. \n\nGiven 'The wug was not sproinged', we can now conclude 'The wug was not garpled' using modus ponens on the contrapositive statement 'If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged' is not the correct approach, but 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is logically equivalent to 'If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged'. \n\nGiven 'The wug was not sproinged', we can now conclude 'The wug was not garpled' using the contrapositive of the original statement and modus tollens on the original statement. \n\nAnswer: yes",
