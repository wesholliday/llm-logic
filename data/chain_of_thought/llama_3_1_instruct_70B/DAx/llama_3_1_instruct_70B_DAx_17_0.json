            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The flob was not movated', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B' or 'A \u2192 B'. The second statement 'The flob was not skizzled' is the negation of the condition 'A', which can be represented as '\u00acA'. \n\nIn logic, the rule of inference we are looking for is called 'modus tollens', which states that if we have 'A \u2192 B' and '\u00acA', we can infer '\u00acB'. However, in this case, we are trying to infer '\u00acB' from 'A \u2192 B' and '\u00acA', which is actually the contrapositive of modus tollens. The contrapositive of 'A \u2192 B' is '\u00acB \u2192 \u00acA', but we are given 'A \u2192 B' and '\u00acA', so we can indeed infer '\u00acB' using the contrapositive of modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
