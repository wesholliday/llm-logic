            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The grommet did not plop the frink', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'A \u2192 B', where A is 'the grommet was sploffed' and B is 'the grommet plopped the frink'. The second statement 'The grommet was not sploffed' is the negation of A, which can be represented as '\u00acA'. \n\nIn logic, the rule of inference we are looking for is called 'modus tollens', which states that if we have 'A \u2192 B' and '\u00acA', we can infer '\u00acB'. Applying this rule to our statements, we can see that if 'the grommet was sploffed' (A) leads to 'the grommet plopped the frink' (B), and we know 'the grommet was not sploffed' (\u00acA), then we can infer 'the grommet did not plop the frink' (\u00acB).\n\nAnswer: yes",
