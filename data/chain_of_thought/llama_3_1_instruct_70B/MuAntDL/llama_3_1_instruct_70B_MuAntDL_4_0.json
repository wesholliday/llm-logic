            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled' presents two possible scenarios: the meeting took place at 2 PM, or it was cancelled. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. However, it does not provide any information that would allow us to rule out the possibility of the meeting being cancelled. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the meeting must have been at 2 PM, as the statement still leaves open the possibility of cancellation.\n\nAnswer: no",
