            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The envelope must have been under a bed or upstairs' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possible alternatives. To infer 'The envelope must have been under a bed', we would need to eliminate the possibility of it being upstairs. However, the original statement does not provide any information that would allow us to rule out the possibility of the envelope being upstairs. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the envelope must have been under a bed based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
