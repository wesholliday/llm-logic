However, it does not provide any information that would allow us to rule out one of the options. The statement does not imply that the flight was delayed; it simply states that it was either delayed or on time. To infer 'The flight must have been delayed', we would need additional information that contradicts the possibility of the flight being on time, which is not provided in the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
