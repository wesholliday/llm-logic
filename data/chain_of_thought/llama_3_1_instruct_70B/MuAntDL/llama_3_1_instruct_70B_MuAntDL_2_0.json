To infer 'The book must have been on the shelf', we would need to know that the book was not in the library. However, the original statement does not provide this information. It only states that the book must have been in one of the two locations, but it does not exclude the possibility of the book being in the library. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the book must have been on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no",
