In order to infer 'The report must have been accurate', we would need to know that the report was not revised. However, the given statement does not provide this information. It only states that the report must have been either accurate or revised, but it does not rule out the possibility of the report being revised. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that 'The report must have been accurate'.\n\nAnswer: no",
