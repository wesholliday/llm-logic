            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B' (where A is 'the shirt was cotton' and B is 'the pants must have been denim'). \n\nThe second statement is 'The pants might not have been denim'. This statement can be represented as 'Not B' (where B is 'the pants must have been denim'). However, 'The pants might not have been denim' is not the same as 'The pants were not denim'. 'Might not have been' implies uncertainty, whereas 'were not' is a definitive statement.\n\nIn a conditional statement 'If A, then B', if we know 'Not B', we can infer 'Not A' (this is known as modus tollens). However, in this case, we have 'The pants might not have been denim', which is not the same as 'The pants were not denim'. Therefore, we cannot apply modus tollens directly.\n\nHowever, we can rephrase 'The pants might not have been denim' as 'It is possible that the pants were not denim'. This implies that we do not have enough information to confirm that the pants were denim. Given the conditional statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim', if we cannot confirm that the pants were denim, we cannot confirm that the shirt was cotton. But we cannot conclude that the shirt was not cotton with absolute certainty.\n\nHowever, in a more nuanced interpretation, if we consider 'The pants might not have been denim' as a statement that introduces doubt about the pants being denim, and given the conditional statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim', we can infer that if there is any doubt about the pants being denim, then there should also be doubt about the shirt being cotton. In this case, we can make a weaker inference that 'The shirt might not have been cotton'. However, this is not the same as 'The shirt was not cotton'.\n\nConsidering the original question, we are asked if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton'. Based on the given statements, we cannot make this inference with absolute certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
