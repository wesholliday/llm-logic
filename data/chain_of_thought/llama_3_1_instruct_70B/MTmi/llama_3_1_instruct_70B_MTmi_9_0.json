            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the second statement 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt' introduces uncertainty about Mark's action. This statement does not directly contradict the first statement, but it does suggest that the consequence of the first statement (Mark buying the blue shirt) might not be true.\n\nTo infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we would need to know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, not just that he might not have. If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then we could conclude that the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) must be false, because the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) is false.\n\nHowever, since we only know that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, we cannot be certain that the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is false. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' with absolute certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
