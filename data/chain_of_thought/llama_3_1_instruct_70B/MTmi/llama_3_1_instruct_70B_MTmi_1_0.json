            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', let's break down the given statements. The first statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' implies a conditional relationship between Mary's and Sue's presence at the wedding. This means if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue's presence is guaranteed. However, it does not provide any information about the situation if Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement 'Sue might not have been at the wedding' introduces the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding. Combining this with the first statement, we can infer that if Sue might not have been at the wedding, then Mary's presence is not guaranteed. However, it does not necessarily mean Mary was not at the wedding, as the first statement only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary was at the wedding, not the other way around.\n\nHowever, if we consider the contrapositive of the first statement, which is 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding', we can see that if Sue might not have been at the wedding, then it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding. But we cannot be certain of this, as the second statement only says Sue 'might not have been' at the wedding, not that she definitely was not.\n\nConsidering the information provided, we can make an educated guess, but we cannot be 100% certain. However, in classical logic, we can indeed infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statements, as the contrapositive of the first statement and the second statement together imply that if Sue might not have been at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
