            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Tom did not watch football', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the condition (Tom watching football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Tom does not watch football.\n\nThe second statement 'Jen might not have watched basketball' indicates that it is possible for Jen not to have watched basketball. This statement does not provide any direct information about Tom's actions.\n\nCombining the two statements, we can see that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball (according to the first statement). However, since we know that Jen might not have watched basketball (according to the second statement), it is possible that the condition (Tom watching football) is not met. This is because if Tom had watched football, then Jen would have definitely watched basketball, which contradicts the possibility of Jen not watching basketball.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football, as this is the only way to reconcile the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
