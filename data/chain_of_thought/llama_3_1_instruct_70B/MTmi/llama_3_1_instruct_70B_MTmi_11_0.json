            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry' is a conditional statement. It implies that if the cake is indeed chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, it does not provide any information about the cake if the muffins are not blueberry.\n\nThe second statement 'The muffins might not have been blueberry' introduces uncertainty about the type of muffins. Since the first statement only guarantees the type of muffins if the cake is chocolate, and we are not certain about the muffins being blueberry, we cannot directly conclude the type of cake.\n\nHowever, we can use a process of elimination and the concept of contrapositive to analyze the situation. The contrapositive of the first statement would be 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate'. Given that we are uncertain about the muffins being blueberry, we can consider the possibility that they were not blueberry. If that's the case, then according to the contrapositive, the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
