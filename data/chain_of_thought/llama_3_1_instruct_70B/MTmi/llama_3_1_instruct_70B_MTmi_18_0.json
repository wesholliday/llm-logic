            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal'. This statement implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal, but it does not provide any information about the doll being plastic or not. The second statement is 'The truck might not have been metal', which means there is a possibility that the truck is not metal.\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements. If the truck might not have been metal, and we know that if the doll was plastic, the truck must have been metal, then it is possible that the doll was not plastic, because if it were plastic, the truck would have to be metal, which contradicts the possibility of the truck not being metal.\n\nHowever, we cannot conclude with absolute certainty that the doll was not plastic, because the second statement only says the truck 'might not have been metal', which leaves room for the possibility that the truck was indeed metal. If the truck was metal, then the first statement does not provide any information about the doll being plastic or not.\n\nBut, in this case, we can use a logical rule called 'modus tollens' or 'denying the consequent'. This rule states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that 'B is not true', then we can conclude 'A is not true'. In this case, 'A' is 'the doll was plastic' and 'B' is 'the truck must have been metal'. Since we know that 'the truck might not have been metal', we can conclude that 'the doll was not plastic' is a possible conclusion, but we can also say that if the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
