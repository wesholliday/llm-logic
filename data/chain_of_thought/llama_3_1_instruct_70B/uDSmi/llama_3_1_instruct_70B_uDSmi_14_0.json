Statement (2) tells us that it is possible that the milk is not chilling in the fridge. \n\nHowever, statement (2) does not confirm that the milk is not chilling in the fridge; it only says it might not be. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the milk is on the counter, as it is still possible that the milk is chilling in the fridge.\n\nAnswer: no",
