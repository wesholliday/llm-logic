The umbrella might not be tucked away in the closet.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have two possibilities: the umbrella is in the car, or it is tucked away in the closet. The second statement tells us that it's possible the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet. However, it does not confirm that the umbrella is not in the closet; it only says it might not be. \n\nSince the umbrella might not be in the closet, it could still be in the closet, or it could be in the car. We cannot rule out the possibility of the umbrella being in the closet based on the given information. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: no",
