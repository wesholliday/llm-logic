The book might not be resting on the table.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have two possibilities: the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table. The second statement tells us that it's possible the book is not resting on the table. However, it does not confirm that the book is not resting on the table; it only says it might not be. \n\nSince we cannot confirm that the book is not resting on the table, we cannot eliminate the possibility that the book is resting on the table. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no",
