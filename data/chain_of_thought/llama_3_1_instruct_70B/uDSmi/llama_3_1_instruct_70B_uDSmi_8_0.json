The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch. Statement 2 tells us that it is possible that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. This means that the possibility of the remote control hiding under the couch is not a certainty, but it does not rule out the possibility entirely.\n\nHowever, since statement 1 presents an 'either-or' situation, if the remote control is not hiding under the couch (as stated in statement 2), then the only other possibility is that it is on the coffee table. \n\nAnswer: yes",
