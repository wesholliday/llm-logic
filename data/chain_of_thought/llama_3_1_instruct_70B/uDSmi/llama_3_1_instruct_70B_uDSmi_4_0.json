The cat might not be playing in the bedroom.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: the cat is napping on the couch or it is playing in the bedroom. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible the cat is not playing in the bedroom. This means we can't rule out the possibility of the cat napping on the couch, but we also can't rule out the possibility that the cat is doing something else entirely in the bedroom (since 'might not be playing' doesn't necessarily mean it's not in the bedroom). However, given the two options provided in statement 1, if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then the only option left is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
