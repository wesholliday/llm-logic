The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that there are only two possible locations for the sunglasses: in her bag or on her head. The second statement tells us that it's possible for the sunglasses not to be on her head. \n\nHowever, the second statement does not confirm that the sunglasses are not on her head; it only says it's possible. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of the sunglasses being on her head. \n\nSince we cannot confirm that the sunglasses are not on her head, we also cannot confirm that they are in her bag. The information provided is not sufficient to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
