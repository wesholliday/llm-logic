The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have two possibilities: the watch is charging on the dresser, or it is on his wrist. The second statement tells us that it's possible the watch is not on his wrist. However, it does not confirm that the watch is not on his wrist; it only says it might not be.\n\nSince we only know that the watch might not be on his wrist, we cannot rule out the possibility that it is on his wrist. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
