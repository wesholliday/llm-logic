The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the keys are either in the drawer or in the cabinet. The second statement tells us that it's possible the keys are not in the cabinet. However, it does not confirm that the keys are not in the cabinet; it only says it's possible. \n\nSince we only know it's possible the keys are not in the cabinet, we cannot rule out the possibility that the keys are indeed in the cabinet. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: no",
