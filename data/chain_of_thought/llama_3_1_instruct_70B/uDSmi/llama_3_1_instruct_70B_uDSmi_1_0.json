Fido might not be in the garden.\n\nFrom statement 1, we have two possibilities: Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. Statement 2 tells us that Fido might not be in the garden, which means the possibility of Fido being in the garden is not certain. However, statement 1 is an 'either-or' statement, which means if one possibility is not true, the other must be true. Since Fido might not be in the garden, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
