The second statement is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B' or A \u2192 B, where A is 'Alex finished the race' and B is 'Chris finished the race'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the consequent (B) is false, and the statement is true, then we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is false. In this case, we know that Chris did not finish the race (B is false), and the conditional statement is true. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race (A is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
