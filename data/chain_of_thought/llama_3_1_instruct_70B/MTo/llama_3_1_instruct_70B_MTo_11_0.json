            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate', let's analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The muffins were not blueberry'. The second statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the cake was chocolate' and B is 'the muffins were blueberry'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true, then the consequence (B) must also be true. However, if the consequence (B) is false, we can conclude that the condition (A) is also false. In this case, we know that the consequence (B) 'the muffins were blueberry' is false, as stated in the first statement. \n\nTherefore, using the principle of modus tollens (if not B, then not A), we can infer that the condition (A) 'the cake was chocolate' is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
