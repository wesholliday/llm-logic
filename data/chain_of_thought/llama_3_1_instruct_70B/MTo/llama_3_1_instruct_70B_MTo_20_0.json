            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The banana was not yellow'. The second statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the apple was red' and B is 'the banana was yellow'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true, then the consequence (B) must also be true. However, if the consequence (B) is false, we can conclude that the condition (A) is also false. In this case, we know that the banana was not yellow (B is false). Therefore, we can infer that the condition 'the apple was red' (A) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
