            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' is a direct statement about Mark's action. The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement that connects Lisa's action to Mark's action.\n\nFrom the second statement, we can see that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark would have bought the blue shirt. However, we know from the first statement that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that the condition 'Lisa bought the red shirt' cannot be true, because if it were true, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, because if she had, Mark would have bought the blue shirt, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
