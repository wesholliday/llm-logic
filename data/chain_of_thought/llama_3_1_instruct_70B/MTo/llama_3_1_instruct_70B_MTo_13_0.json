            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The car was not red', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The truck was not blue'. The second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'The car was red' and B is 'The truck was blue'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true, then the consequence (B) must also be true. However, if the consequence (B) is false, we can conclude that the condition (A) is also false. In this case, we know that the consequence (B) 'The truck was blue' is false, as stated in the first statement 'The truck was not blue'. \n\nTherefore, we can apply the rule of modus tollens, which states that if the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false. In this case, since 'The truck was blue' is false, we can conclude that 'The car was red' is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
