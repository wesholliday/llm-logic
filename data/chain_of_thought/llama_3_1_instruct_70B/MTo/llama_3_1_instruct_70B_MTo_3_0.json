            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book was not written by James', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The book is not a mystery novel'. The second statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the book was written by James' and B is 'the book is a mystery novel'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true, then the consequence (B) must also be true. However, if the consequence (B) is false, we can conclude that the condition (A) is also false. In this case, we know that the book is not a mystery novel (B is false). Therefore, we can apply the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that if the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
