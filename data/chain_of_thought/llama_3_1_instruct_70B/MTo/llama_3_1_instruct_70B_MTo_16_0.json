            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The pants were not denim'. The second statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'The shirt was cotton' and B is 'The pants were denim'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true, then the consequence (B) must also be true. However, if the consequence (B) is false, we can conclude that the condition (A) is also false. In this case, we know that the pants were not denim (B is false). Therefore, we can conclude that the condition 'The shirt was cotton' (A) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
