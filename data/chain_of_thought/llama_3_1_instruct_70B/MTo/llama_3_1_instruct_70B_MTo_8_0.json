            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The vampire was not awake', let's analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The mummy was not awake', which directly tells us the state of the mummy. The second statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', which is a conditional statement. This statement implies that if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must also be awake. However, we already know that the mummy is not awake. \n\nGiven that the mummy is not awake, and the conditional statement that if the vampire is awake then the mummy must be awake, we can conclude that the vampire cannot be awake. If the vampire were awake, it would contradict the fact that the mummy is not awake. Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that the vampire is not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
