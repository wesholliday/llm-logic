            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Tom did not watch football', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Jen did not watch basketball' is a direct statement about Jen's actions. The second statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement that links Tom's action to Jen's action. \n\nGiven that we know Jen did not watch basketball, we can use this information to evaluate the conditional statement. If the condition 'Tom watched football' were true, then the consequence 'Jen watched basketball' should also be true according to the conditional statement. However, we know that Jen did not watch basketball, which means the consequence is false. \n\nSince the consequence is false, we can conclude that the condition 'Tom watched football' must also be false, because if it were true, the consequence would have to be true as well. Therefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
