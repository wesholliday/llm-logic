            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', let's analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'Sue was not at the wedding', which is a direct statement about Sue's absence. The second statement is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', which is a conditional statement that links Mary's presence to Sue's presence.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know Sue was not at the wedding. Now, let's consider the second statement. If Mary's presence implies Sue's presence, and we know Sue was not present, then it must be the case that Mary was not present either. This is because if Mary were present, Sue would have to be present according to the conditional statement, but we know Sue was not present.\n\nTherefore, we can use the process of modus tollens to infer that Mary was not at the wedding. Modus tollens is a logical rule that states: if A implies B, and B is false, then A must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
