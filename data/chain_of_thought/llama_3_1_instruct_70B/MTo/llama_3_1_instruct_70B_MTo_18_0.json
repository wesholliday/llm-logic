            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The truck was not metal'. The second statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the doll was plastic' and B is 'the truck was metal'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true, then the consequence (B) must also be true. However, if the consequence (B) is false, we can conclude that the condition (A) is also false. In this case, we know that the consequence (B) 'the truck was metal' is false, as stated in the first statement 'The truck was not metal'. \n\nTherefore, we can apply the rule of modus tollens, which states that if the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false. In this case, since 'the truck was metal' is false, we can conclude that 'the doll was plastic' is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
