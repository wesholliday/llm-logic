            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states that getting enough sleep is sufficient to prevent tiredness. However, the conclusion adds an additional condition, 'doing hard labor', which is not present in the premise. \n\nThe premise does not provide any information about the effect of hard labor on tiredness. It only guarantees that getting enough sleep will prevent tiredness, but it does not account for other factors that might cause tiredness, such as physical exertion. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is not logically entailed by the premise, as it introduces a new condition that is not addressed in the premise. This means that the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
