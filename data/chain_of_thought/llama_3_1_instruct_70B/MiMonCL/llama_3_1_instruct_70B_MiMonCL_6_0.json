The statement is a compound sentence, consisting of two clauses connected by 'and'. The first clause is 'The experiment might be successful', and the second clause is 'yield groundbreaking results'. \n\nIn a compound sentence with 'and', both clauses must be true for the entire statement to be true. However, when we are inferring information, we can consider each clause separately. Since 'The experiment might be successful' is a part of the original statement, we can directly infer this information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
