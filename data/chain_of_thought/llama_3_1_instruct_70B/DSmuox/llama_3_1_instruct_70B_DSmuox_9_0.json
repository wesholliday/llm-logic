The first statement 'It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked' implies that it's not necessary for the twonk to be plinked. The second statement 'Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked' presents two possibilities: the twonk is varnished, or it must be plinked.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that it's not necessary for the twonk to be plinked, we can eliminate the 'it must be plinked' option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility: 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
