            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat is morphed', let's break down the given statements. The first statement 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked' implies that it's not necessary for the splat to be quanked. The second statement 'Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked' presents two possibilities: the splat is morphed, or it must be quanked.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that 'it must be quanked' is not a requirement. Therefore, the only way the second statement can be true is if 'the splat is morphed' is the case, since 'it must be quanked' is not a requirement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
