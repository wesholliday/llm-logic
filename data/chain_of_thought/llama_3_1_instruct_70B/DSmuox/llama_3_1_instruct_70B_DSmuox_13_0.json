The first statement is 'It's not the case that the glip must be tragged', which can be rewritten as 'The glip does not have to be tragged'. The second statement is 'Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged'. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that being tragged is not a requirement for the glip. The second statement presents two possibilities: the glip is slogged, or it must be tragged. However, we already know from the first statement that it's not necessary for the glip to be tragged. \n\nSince the second option (it must be tragged) is ruled out by the first statement, we are left with the first option: the glip is slogged. \n\nAnswer: yes",
