The first statement is 'It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled', which can be rewritten as 'The sprocket does not have to be daggled'. The second statement is 'Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled'. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that being daggled is not a requirement for the sprocket. The second statement presents two possibilities: the sprocket is cranked, or it must be daggled. Since we know from the first statement that it does not have to be daggled, the 'must be daggled' option is eliminated. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility: the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
