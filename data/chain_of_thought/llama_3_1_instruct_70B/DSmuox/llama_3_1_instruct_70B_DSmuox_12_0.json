The first statement is 'It's not the case that the smip must be lupped', which can be rewritten as 'The smip does not have to be lupped'. The second statement is 'Either the smip is shripped or it must be lupped'. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the smip does not have to be lupped. Now, let's consider the second statement. If the smip does not have to be lupped, then for the second statement to be true, the smip must be shripped, because it's an 'either-or' situation and the 'must be lupped' option is ruled out by the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
