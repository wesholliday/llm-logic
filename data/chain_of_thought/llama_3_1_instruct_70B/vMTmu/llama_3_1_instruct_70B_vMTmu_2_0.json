            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be broken down into the following logical form:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest)\n3. Therefore, Not P (The griffin was not in the forest)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
