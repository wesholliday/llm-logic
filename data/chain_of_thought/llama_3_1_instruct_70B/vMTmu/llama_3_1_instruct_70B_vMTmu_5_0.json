            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be broken down into the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis)\n3. Therefore, Not P (Jeff did not play basketball)\n\nThis argument form is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P is also false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the Modus Tollens form, where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy must have played tennis\". Since the second premise states that Q is false (Amy must not have played tennis), we can conclude that P is also false (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nAnswer: yes",
