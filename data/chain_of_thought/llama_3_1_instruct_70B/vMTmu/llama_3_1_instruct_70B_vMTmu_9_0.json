            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (If P, then Q)\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt (Not Q)\nConclusion: Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not P)\n\nThis argument follows the form of Modus Tollens, which is a valid logical argument form. Modus Tollens states that if we have 'If P, then Q' and 'Not Q', we can conclude 'Not P'. This form is valid because if the condition 'If P, then Q' is true, and 'Q' is false, then 'P' must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
