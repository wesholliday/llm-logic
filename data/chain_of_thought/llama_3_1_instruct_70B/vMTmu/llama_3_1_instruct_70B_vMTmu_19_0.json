            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball (If P, then Q)\n2. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (Not Q)\n3. Conclusion: Tom did not watch football (Not P)\n\nThis argument form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false. In this case, the first premise states that watching football implies Jen must have watched basketball. The second premise states that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball, which is equivalent to saying Jen did not necessarily watch basketball. \n\nGiven the form of the argument and the rules of modus tollens, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
