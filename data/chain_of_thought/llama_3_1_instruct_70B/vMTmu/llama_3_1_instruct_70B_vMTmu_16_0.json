            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim (If P, then Q).\n2. It's not the case that the pants must have been denim (Not Q).\n3. The shirt was not cotton (Not P).\n\nThis argument follows the form of modus tollens, which is a valid logical argument form. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false. In this case, if the shirt being cotton implies the pants being denim, and the pants are not necessarily denim, then the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
