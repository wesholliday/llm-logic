            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be broken down into the following form:\n\n1. If P, then Q (If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal)\n2. Not Q (It's not the case that the truck must have been metal)\n3. Therefore, Not P (The doll was not plastic)\n\nThis form of argument is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false. \n\nIn this case, the argument follows the modus tollens form, where P is 'the doll was plastic' and Q is 'the truck must have been metal'. Since the argument follows a valid form, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
