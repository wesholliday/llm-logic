            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is in the form of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The modus tollens form is as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\n\u2234 Not P\n\nIn this case, P is 'the apple was red', and Q is 'the banana must have been yellow'. The first premise is 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow', which corresponds to 'If P, then Q'. The second premise is 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow', which corresponds to 'Not Q'. The conclusion is 'The apple was not red', which corresponds to 'Not P'.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, which is a valid form of argument, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
