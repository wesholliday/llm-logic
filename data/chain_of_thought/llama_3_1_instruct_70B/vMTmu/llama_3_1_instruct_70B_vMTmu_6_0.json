            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (If P, then Q)\n2. It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta (Not Q)\n3. Sue did not choose pizza (Not P)\n\nThis argument follows the form of Modus Tollens, which is a valid logical argument form. Modus Tollens states that if we have 'If P, then Q' and 'Not Q', we can conclude 'Not P'. \n\nIn this case, the argument follows the same structure: 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta' (If P, then Q) and 'It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta' (Not Q) lead to the conclusion 'Sue did not choose pizza' (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
