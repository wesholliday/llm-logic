If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (If A, then C)\n2. It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race (Not C)\n3. Alex did not finish the race (Not A)\n\nThis argument follows the form of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens is represented as:\n\nIf A, then C\nNot C\n\u2234 Not A\n\nIn this form, if the first premise (If A, then C) is true, and the second premise (Not C) is true, then the conclusion (Not A) logically follows. \n\nAnswer: yes",
