            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry)\nPremise 2: Not Q (It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry)\nConclusion: Not P (The cake was not chocolate)\n\nThis argument form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must be false. \n\nAnswer: yes",
