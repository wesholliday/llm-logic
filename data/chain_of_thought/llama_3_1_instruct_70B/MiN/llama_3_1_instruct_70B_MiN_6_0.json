            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's break down the given statement and the statement we're trying to infer. The original statement is 'Sue might not have chosen pizza', which implies that it's possible Sue didn't choose pizza. This statement is equivalent to saying 'It's possible that Sue didn't choose pizza'. \n\nNow, let's analyze the statement we're trying to infer: 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza'. This statement is equivalent to saying 'Sue doesn't necessarily have to have chosen pizza', or 'It's not necessary that Sue chose pizza'. \n\nSince 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' implies that it's possible Sue didn't choose pizza, it also implies that it's not necessary for Sue to have chosen pizza. Therefore, we can logically infer 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' from 'Sue might not have chosen pizza'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
