            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box' from 'The toy might not be in the toy box', we need to analyze the meaning of the two statements. The original statement 'The toy might not be in the toy box' implies that it is possible for the toy to not be in the toy box, but it does not rule out the possibility that the toy is in the toy box. The statement 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box' means that it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box, which is equivalent to saying that it is possible for the toy to not be in the toy box.\n\nSince both statements convey the same idea, we can conclude that 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box' is a logical inference from 'The toy might not be in the toy box'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
