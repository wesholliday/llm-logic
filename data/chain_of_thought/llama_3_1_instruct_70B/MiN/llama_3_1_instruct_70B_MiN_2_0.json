The original statement is 'The griffin might not have been in the forest'. This statement implies that it's possible the griffin was not in the forest, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it was in the forest.\n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest'. This statement is saying that it's not necessary for the griffin to have been in the forest. \n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest, it also implies that it's not necessary for the griffin to have been in the forest. Therefore, we can make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
