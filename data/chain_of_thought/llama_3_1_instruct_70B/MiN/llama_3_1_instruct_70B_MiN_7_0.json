The original statement is 'Alex might not have finished the race', which implies that there's a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, but it also leaves open the possibility that Alex did finish the race. \n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race'. This statement is saying that it's not necessarily true that Alex finished the race. \n\nSince 'Alex might not have finished the race' implies that there's a possibility Alex didn't finish, it also implies that it's not necessarily true that Alex finished the race. Therefore, the inference seems valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
