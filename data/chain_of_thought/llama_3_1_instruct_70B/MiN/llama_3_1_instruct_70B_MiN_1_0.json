            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' from 'Mary might not have been at the wedding', we need to analyze the meaning of the two statements. 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' implies that it's possible Mary wasn't at the wedding, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that she was. On the other hand, 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' means that it's not necessary for Mary to have been at the wedding, which is equivalent to saying that it's possible she wasn't.\n\nSince 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' implies that it's possible she wasn't at the wedding, it also implies that it's not necessary for her to have been at the wedding. Therefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' from 'Mary might not have been at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
