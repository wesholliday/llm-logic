The original statement is 'The jacket might not be draped over the chair', which implies that there's a possibility that the jacket is not draped over the chair, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that it is draped over the chair. \n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair'. This statement is saying that it's not necessary for the jacket to be draped over the chair. \n\nSince 'The jacket might not be draped over the chair' implies that it's possible for the jacket not to be draped over the chair, it also implies that it's not necessary for the jacket to be draped over the chair. Therefore, we can make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
