The original statement is 'The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack', which implies that there's a possibility the scarf is not in the backpack, but it also leaves open the possibility that it might be. \n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack'. This statement is saying that it's not necessary for the scarf to be in the backpack. \n\nGiven the original statement, we can see that it directly contradicts the idea that the scarf 'must' be in the backpack, since it suggests there's a possibility it's not. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
