The original statement is 'The newspaper might not be in the driveway', which implies that it's possible the newspaper is not in the driveway, but it's also possible it is. This statement is expressing a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway'. This statement is saying that it's not necessary for the newspaper to be in the driveway. \n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility of the newspaper not being in the driveway, it also implies that it's not necessary for the newspaper to be in the driveway. Therefore, we can make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
