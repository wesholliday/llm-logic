            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, let's break down the given statement and the statement we're trying to infer. The original statement is 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt'. This statement implies that there's a possibility that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that she did buy it. \n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt'. This statement is saying that it's not necessary or certain that Lisa bought the red shirt. \n\nSince 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' implies that there's a possibility she didn't buy it, it also implies that it's not certain that she bought it. Therefore, we can conclude that 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' is a logical inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
