The first statement is 'Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed'. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed', which is the negation of 'The flug must be zimmed'. \n\nGiven the second statement, we know that 'The flug must be zimmed' is false. Now, looking back at the first statement, since 'The flug must be zimmed' is false, the only way for the disjunction to be true is if 'The flug is blummed' is true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
