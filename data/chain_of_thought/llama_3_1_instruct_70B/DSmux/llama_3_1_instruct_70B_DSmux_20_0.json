The first statement is 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned', which can be represented as 'A or B'. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned', which can be represented as 'not B'. \n\nIn a logical 'or' statement, if one of the options is false, the other option must be true for the entire statement to be true. Since we know 'not B' (it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned), we can conclude that 'A' (the fleeg is bluttered) must be true for the first statement to hold.\n\nAnswer: yes",
