The first statement 'Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'It's not the case that the glip must be tragged' is a negation of the second condition in the disjunction.\n\nGiven that the second condition is negated, we can eliminate it as a possibility. Since the disjunction states that at least one of the conditions must be true, and the second condition is not true, the first condition 'The glip is slogged' must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
