            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat is morphed', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'It's not the case that the splat must be quanked' is a negation of the second condition in the disjunction.\n\nIf the second condition 'it must be quanked' is not true, then the only remaining option in the disjunction is 'the splat is morphed'. This is because a disjunction is true if at least one of its conditions is true, and since the second condition is false, the first condition must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nAnswer: yes",
