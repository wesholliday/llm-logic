The first statement 'The pen isn't on my desk' tells us that the pen is not on the desk. The second statement 'Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk' presents two possible locations for the pen: in the bag or on the desk. Since we know from the first statement that the pen is not on the desk, we can eliminate that option. This leaves us with only one possible location: the bag. \n\nAnswer: yes",
