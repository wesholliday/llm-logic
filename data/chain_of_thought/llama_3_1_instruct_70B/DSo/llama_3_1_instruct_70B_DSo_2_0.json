The first statement 'The book isn't resting on the table' tells us that the book is not on the table. The second statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table' presents two possible locations for the book: the shelf or the table. Since we know from the first statement that the book is not on the table, we can eliminate that option. This leaves us with only one possible location: the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
