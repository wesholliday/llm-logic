The first statement says 'The shoes aren't lined up by the door', which directly contradicts the second part of the second statement 'they are lined up by the door'. Since we know the shoes aren't lined up by the door, we can eliminate that option. The second statement also says 'Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door', which presents two possible locations for the shoes. Since we've already eliminated the possibility of the shoes being lined up by the door, the only remaining option is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
