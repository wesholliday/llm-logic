            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The watch is charging on the dresser', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'The watch isn't on his wrist' tells us the watch's location is not on his wrist. The second statement 'Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist' presents two possible locations for the watch: on the dresser or on his wrist. Since we know from the first statement that the watch is not on his wrist, we can eliminate that option. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility, which is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
