The first statement, 'The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry', tells us that the cookies are not in the pantry. The second statement, 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry', presents two possible locations for the cookies: the jar or the pantry. Since we know from the first statement that the cookies are not in the pantry, we can eliminate that option. This leaves us with only one possible location: the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
