            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The zibble might be quorked' from 'The zibble might be frobbed and quorked', we need to analyze the given statement. The statement 'The zibble might be frobbed and quorked' implies that there is a possibility of the zibble being both frobbed and quorked. However, it does not rule out the possibility of the zibble being quorked without being frobbed. \n\nIn logical terms, 'The zibble might be frobbed and quorked' can be represented as 'Might (Frobbed and Quorked)', where 'Might' denotes possibility. Since 'Might (Frobbed and Quorked)' implies 'Might (Quorked)', we can infer that 'The zibble might be quorked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
