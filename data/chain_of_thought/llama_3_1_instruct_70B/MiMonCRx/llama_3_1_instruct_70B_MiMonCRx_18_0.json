The statement 'The wibble might be plonked and zazzled' implies that there are two possible actions (plonked and zazzled) that might happen to 'the wibble'. Since 'zazzled' is one of the actions mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude that 'the wibble' might indeed be zazzled, even if it's not the only possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
