The statement 'The snorkel might be zibbed and flumped' implies that there is a possibility of the snorkel being both zibbed and flumped. However, it also implies that there is a possibility of the snorkel being only zibbed, only flumped, or neither. Since 'and' is used to connect the two actions, we can infer that 'flumped' is one of the possibilities mentioned in the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
