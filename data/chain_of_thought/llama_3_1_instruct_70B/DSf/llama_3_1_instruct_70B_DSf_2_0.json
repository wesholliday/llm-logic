            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is on the shelf', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf' presents two possible locations for the book, and it implies that these are the only two possibilities. The second statement 'The book isn't resting on the table' eliminates one of the possibilities, leaving only one option. \n\nGiven that the first statement presents an 'either-or' situation and the second statement eliminates one of the options, we can use the process of elimination to conclude that the book must be in the remaining location. This type of reasoning is based on the principle of the excluded middle, which states that if a statement is either true or false, and one option is eliminated, the other option must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
