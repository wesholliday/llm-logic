            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a disjunction (an 'or' statement) that presents two possible locations for the remote control: under the couch or on the coffee table. The second statement negates one of the options, stating that the remote control is not under the couch. \n\nGiven that the first statement presents two mutually exclusive options (the remote control can't be in both places at the same time), and the second statement eliminates one of those options, we can logically conclude that the remaining option must be true. This is an example of a process of elimination, where we eliminate one possibility and are left with the other.\n\nAnswer: yes",
