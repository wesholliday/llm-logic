The original statement 'The grazzle must be wumble' implies that the only possibility for the grazzle is to be wumble. It does not provide any information about the possibility of the grazzle being frazzle. \n\nIn the statement 'The grazzle must be frazzle or wumble', we are introducing an additional possibility (frazzle) that is not present in the original statement. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the possibility of the grazzle being frazzle, we cannot infer this new possibility from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
