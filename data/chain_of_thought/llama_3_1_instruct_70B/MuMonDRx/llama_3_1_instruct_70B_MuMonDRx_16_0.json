However, it does not provide any information about 'quimble flonk'. The statement does not rule out the possibility of 'The plonk' being 'quimble flonk', but it does not provide any evidence to support it either. \n\nHowever, we can infer that 'The plonk' must be 'flimble zibber', and since 'flimble zibber' is one of the options in the second statement, we can conclude that 'The plonk' must be 'quimble flonk or flimble zibber' because 'flimble zibber' is a subset of the options provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
