The word 'or' is used to connect these options, indicating that either one or the other (or both) could be true. The phrase 'might be taken' is applied to both options, implying that each option is a possibility. Therefore, we can break down the statement into two separate possibilities: 'The medicine might be taken with food' and 'The medicine might be taken on an empty stomach'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
