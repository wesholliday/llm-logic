            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The flight might be delayed or on time' is a disjunction of two possibilities: 'delayed' and 'on time'. The word 'might' is used to express uncertainty about the outcome. When we rephrase it as 'The flight might be delayed or it might be on time', we are essentially distributing the uncertainty ('might') to both possibilities. This rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, as it still expresses the same uncertainty about the two possible outcomes.\n\nAnswer: yes",
