            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The application might be completed online or in person' implies that there are two possible ways to complete the application: online or in person. The word 'or' is used to indicate a choice between two alternatives. This suggests that the application can be completed in one of these two ways, but not necessarily both. The phrase 'might be completed' also implies a possibility or option, rather than a requirement or obligation. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the application might be completed online or it might be completed in person, as this interpretation aligns with the meaning of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
