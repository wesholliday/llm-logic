            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled' implies that there are two possible outcomes: the meeting starts at 2 PM, or it gets cancelled. The word 'might' is used to express uncertainty about the start time, and 'or' is used to present an alternative outcome. The phrase 'be cancelled' is a concise way of saying 'it might be cancelled', as 'might' is already implied by the context. \n\nThe rephrased statement 'The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled' explicitly states the uncertainty for both outcomes, which is already implicit in the original statement. Therefore, the rephrased statement is a logical inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
