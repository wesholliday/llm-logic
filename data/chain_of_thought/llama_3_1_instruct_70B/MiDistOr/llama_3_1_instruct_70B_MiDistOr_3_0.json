            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The keys might be in the drawer or on the table' is a disjunction, which means it presents two possible alternatives. The word 'or' in this context is inclusive, suggesting that the keys could be in either location, but it does not explicitly state that they might be in one location or the other exclusively. However, the rephrased statement 'The keys might be in the drawer or they might be on the table' explicitly conveys the idea that there are two separate possibilities, and it is clear that the keys are not necessarily in both locations at the same time. This rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, as it still presents the same two alternatives.\n\nAnswer: yes",
