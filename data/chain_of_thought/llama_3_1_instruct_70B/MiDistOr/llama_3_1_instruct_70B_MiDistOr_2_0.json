            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The book might be on the shelf or in the library' is a disjunction, which means it presents two possible alternatives. The word 'or' is used to connect the two alternatives, indicating that the book could be in either of the two locations. The phrase 'might be' is used to express possibility, which applies to both alternatives. \n\nWhen we break down the statement, we can see that 'might be' is applied to the entire disjunction, not just the first alternative. This means that the possibility is being applied to the entire 'or' statement, not just the first part. Therefore, we can infer that the possibility applies to both alternatives, which is equivalent to saying 'The book might be on the shelf or it might be in the library'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
