            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The event might be formal or semi-formal' implies that there are two possibilities for the event: it could be formal, or it could be semi-formal. This is a disjunction, where 'or' is used to connect two alternatives. The statement does not rule out the possibility of the event being either formal or semi-formal, but rather presents both as viable options. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the event might be formal or it might be semi-formal, as this inference is a direct interpretation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
