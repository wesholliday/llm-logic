            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'The exam might be difficult or easy' is a disjunction, which means it presents two possible alternatives. The word 'or' is used to connect the two possibilities. In this context, 'or' is inclusive, meaning that the exam could be either difficult, easy, or possibly both (although 'both' is less likely in this context). The rephrased statement 'The exam might be difficult or it might be easy' explicitly states the possibility of each option separately, which is a more explicit way of expressing the same idea as the original statement. This rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
