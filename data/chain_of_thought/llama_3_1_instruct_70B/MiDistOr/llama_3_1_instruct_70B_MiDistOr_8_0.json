            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or open for limited hours' implies that there are two possible scenarios for the restaurant on Mondays: it could be closed, or it could be open but with limited hours. The word 'or' is used to connect these two possibilities, indicating that they are mutually exclusive alternatives. Therefore, we can infer that the restaurant might be closed on Mondays or it might be open for limited hours, as this inference accurately represents the two possible scenarios presented in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
