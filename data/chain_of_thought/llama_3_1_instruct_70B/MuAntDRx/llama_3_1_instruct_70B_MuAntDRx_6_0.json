The statement does not provide any information that would allow us to rule out 'zibber zizz' as a possibility. It only states that 'the floob' must be one of the two options, but it does not specify which one. Therefore, we cannot infer that 'the floob must be bimboozle' because 'zibber zizz' is still a valid possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
