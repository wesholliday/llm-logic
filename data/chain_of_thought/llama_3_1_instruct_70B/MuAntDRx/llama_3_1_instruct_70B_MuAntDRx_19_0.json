In a disjunction, if one option is not true, the other option must be true for the entire statement to be true. However, we cannot directly infer 'The flibbit must be in plonk' from the given statement because it does not provide any information about the truth value of 'The flibbit must be zibble wozzle'. The statement only tells us that the flibbit must be one of the two options, but it does not specify which one.\n\nAnswer: no",
