The statement 'The froodle must be quorple or flimble' implies that the froodle can be either quorple or flimble, but it does not provide any information about which one is more likely or if one is impossible. \n\nHowever, if we consider the statement alone, without any additional information, we cannot conclude that the froodle must be flimble. The statement allows for the possibility of the froodle being quorple, so we cannot rule out that option.\n\nAnswer: no",
