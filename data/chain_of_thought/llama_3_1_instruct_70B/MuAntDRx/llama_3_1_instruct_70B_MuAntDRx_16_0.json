In a disjunction, if one option is true, the entire statement is true. However, we cannot infer that 'The wozzle must be flibbit blimple' is true based solely on the given statement, because the statement also allows for the possibility that 'The wozzle must be flibbit floob'. We would need additional information to determine which option is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
