In a disjunction, if one of the alternatives is false, the other must be true for the entire statement to be true. However, we cannot directly infer 'The blurble must be on blimple' from the given statement because we do not have any information that would allow us to rule out the possibility of 'The blurble must be plonk'. The statement only tells us that it must be one or the other, but it does not provide any information that would allow us to conclude which one is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
