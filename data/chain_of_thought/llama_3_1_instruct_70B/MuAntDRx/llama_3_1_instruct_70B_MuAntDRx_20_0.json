The statement 'The quorple must be quazzle or quorple' implies that the quorple can be either quazzle or quorple, but it does not exclude the possibility of it being quorple. In fact, it explicitly includes quorple as one of the options. Therefore, we can conclude that if the quorple must be either quazzle or quorple, then it is indeed possible for the quorple to be quorple.\n\nAnswer: yes",
