The statement does not provide any information that would allow us to eliminate either option. It simply states that 'The wibble' must be one of the two options, but it does not specify which one. Therefore, based on the given statement, we cannot conclude that 'The wibble' must be 'blimple' exclusively, but we can infer that it is one of the two options, including 'blimple'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
