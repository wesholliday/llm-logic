The statement does not provide any information that would allow us to rule out either option. However, it does not provide any information that would allow us to conclude that the floob must be on the quibble specifically. The statement only guarantees that the floob is in one of the two locations, but it does not provide enough information to determine which one.\n\nAnswer: no",
