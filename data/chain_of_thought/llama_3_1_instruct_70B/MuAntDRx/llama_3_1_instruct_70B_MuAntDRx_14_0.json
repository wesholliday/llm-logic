The statement 'The zump must be quimble for a shimble or blimp' implies that for the zump to be quimble, it must be either a shimble or a blimp. However, it does not directly state that the zump must be a blimp. The statement provides two options (shimble or blimp) for the zump to be quimble, but it does not make being a blimp a requirement on its own.\n\nAnswer: no",
