The second statement 'The cat isn't playing in the bedroom' eliminates the first option. Since the first option is eliminated, and we are left with only one option, we can infer that the cat must be napping on the couch. This is a classic example of disjunctive syllogism, a valid form of argument in logic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
