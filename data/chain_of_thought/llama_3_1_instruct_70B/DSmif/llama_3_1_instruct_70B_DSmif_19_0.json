The watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that there are only two possible locations for the watch: on his wrist or charging on the dresser. Statement 2 tells us that it's possible the watch is not on his wrist. However, this does not necessarily mean the watch is charging on the dresser. It only means that the possibility of the watch not being on his wrist exists, but it does not confirm the watch's actual location.\n\nIn order to infer that the watch is charging on the dresser, we would need a statement that says the watch is not on his wrist, not just that it might not be. Since we only have the possibility of the watch not being on his wrist, we cannot conclude with certainty that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
