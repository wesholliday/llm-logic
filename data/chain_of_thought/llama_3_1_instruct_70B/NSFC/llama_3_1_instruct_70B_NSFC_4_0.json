The word 'or' in this context is inclusive, meaning it does not exclude the possibility of Tom buying both a car and a motorcycle, but it does not guarantee it either. However, the statement does imply that Tom might buy a car and Tom might buy a motorcycle separately, as both options are presented as possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
