            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'Sarah might study biology or chemistry' implies that there are two possible options for Sarah's course of study, and it is uncertain which one she will choose. The word 'or' in this context is inclusive, meaning it allows for the possibility of either option being true, but it does not necessarily imply that both options are true at the same time. However, it does imply that each option individually is possible. Therefore, we can infer that Sarah might study biology and we can also infer that Sarah might study chemistry, as both options are individually possible.\n\nAnswer: yes",
