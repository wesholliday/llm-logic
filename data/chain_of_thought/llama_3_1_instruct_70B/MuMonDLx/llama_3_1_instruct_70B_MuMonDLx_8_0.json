The original statement is 'The grazzle must be snork on zibble'. The statement we are trying to infer is 'The grazzle must be snork on zibble or wump wump wozzle'. \n\nIn logic, the 'or' operator is inclusive, meaning that if the first condition is true, the entire statement is true regardless of the second condition. Since the original statement 'The grazzle must be snork on zibble' is a specific case that is included in the statement 'The grazzle must be snork on zibble or wump wump wozzle', we can infer the latter from the former.\n\nAnswer: yes",
