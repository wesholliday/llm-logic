This is equivalent to saying that it is not certain that the scarf is in the backpack. If it's not certain that the scarf is in the backpack, then we can infer that it's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack. This is because \"must\" implies a necessity or certainty, which is not present in this situation.\n\nAnswer: yes",
