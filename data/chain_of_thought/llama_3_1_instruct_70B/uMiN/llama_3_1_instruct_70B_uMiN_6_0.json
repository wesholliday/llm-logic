The statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" implies that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This statement does not provide any information about whether Sue must have chosen pizza or not. However, the fact that there is a possibility of her not choosing pizza suggests that it's not a certainty that she chose pizza. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
