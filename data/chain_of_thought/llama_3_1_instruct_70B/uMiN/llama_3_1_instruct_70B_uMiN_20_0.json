This is equivalent to saying that it is not certain that the sunglasses are in her bag. If it's not certain that the sunglasses are in her bag, then we can infer that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag. This is because \"must\" implies a necessity or certainty, which is not present in this situation.\n\nAnswer: yes",
