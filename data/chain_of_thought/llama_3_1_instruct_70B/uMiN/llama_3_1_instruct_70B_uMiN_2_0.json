            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"the griffin might not have been in the forest\" implies that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. This is equivalent to saying that it's not certain that the griffin was in the forest. The phrase \"it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" means that it's not necessary or certain that the griffin was in the forest. Since both statements convey the idea that the griffin's presence in the forest is not certain, we can infer that the second statement is true based on the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
