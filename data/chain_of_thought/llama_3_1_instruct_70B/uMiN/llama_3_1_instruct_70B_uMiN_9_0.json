The statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" implies that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This statement does not provide any information about whether Lisa must have bought the red shirt or not. However, the fact that there is a possibility that she did not buy the red shirt suggests that it is not a certainty that she bought the red shirt. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
