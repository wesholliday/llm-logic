This statement does not assert that the shoes are definitely not in the closet, but rather that it is possible for them not to be there. On the other hand, the statement \"it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet\" implies that it is not a requirement or a necessity for the shoes to be in the closet. This statement is equivalent to saying that the shoes do not have to be in the closet, which aligns with the idea that there is a possibility that they are not there. Therefore, we can infer that if the shoes might not be in the closet, then it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
