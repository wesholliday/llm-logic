The statement says \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" This statement implies that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, but it does not rule out the possibility that she was at the wedding. \n\nThe phrase \"it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" is equivalent to saying that it's not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding. This is consistent with the original statement, as it allows for the possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
