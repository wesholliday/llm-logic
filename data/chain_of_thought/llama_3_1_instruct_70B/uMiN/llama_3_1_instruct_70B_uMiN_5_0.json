The statement \"Jeff might not have played basketball\" implies that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball. This statement does not provide any information about whether Jeff must have played basketball or not. However, the fact that there is a possibility that he did not play basketball suggests that it is not necessarily the case that Jeff must have played basketball. \n\nIn other words, if Jeff must have played basketball, then there would be no possibility of him not playing basketball. But since there is a possibility that he did not play basketball, it contradicts the idea that Jeff must have played basketball. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
