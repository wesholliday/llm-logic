            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is in the form of a modus tollens argument. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that follows this structure: \n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, not P\n\nIn this case, P is 'Sam took a plane', and Q is 'Erin took a train'. The argument follows the modus tollens structure, with the first premise being 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train', the second premise being 'Erin did not take a train', and the conclusion being 'Sam did not take a plane'. \n\nSince the argument follows a valid form, we can conclude that it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
