            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is in the form of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The modus tollens form is as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\n\u2234 Not P\n\nIn this case, P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The argument follows the modus tollens form exactly, with the first premise being the conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', the second premise being the negation of the consequent 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt', and the conclusion being the negation of the antecedent 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
