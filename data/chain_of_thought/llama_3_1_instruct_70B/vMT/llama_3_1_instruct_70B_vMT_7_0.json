If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n2. Chris did not finish the race.\n3. Therefore, Alex did not finish the race.\n\nThis argument follows the form of modus tollens, which is a valid logical argument form. Modus tollens is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P is 'Alex finished the race' and Q is 'Chris finished the race'. The argument matches the modus tollens form, which means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
