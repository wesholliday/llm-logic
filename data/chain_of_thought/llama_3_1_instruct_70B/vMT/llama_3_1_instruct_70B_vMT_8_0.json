            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is as follows:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n2. The mummy was not awake.\n3. Therefore, the vampire was not awake.\n\nThis argument can be represented using propositional logic as follows:\n\n1. V \u2192 M (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake)\n2. \u00acM (The mummy was not awake)\n3. \u2234 \u00acV (Therefore, the vampire was not awake)\n\nThis argument form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid argument form in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if-then) and we know the consequent (the 'then' part) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (the 'if' part) is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
