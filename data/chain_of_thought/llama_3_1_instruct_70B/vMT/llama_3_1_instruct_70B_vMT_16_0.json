            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of a syllogism, specifically a modus tollens argument. The modus tollens form is as follows: \n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, not P\n\nIn this case, P is 'the shirt was cotton' and Q is 'the pants were denim'. The argument follows the modus tollens form exactly. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument in classical logic, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
