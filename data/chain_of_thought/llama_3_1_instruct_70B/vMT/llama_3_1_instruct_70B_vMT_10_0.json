            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument can be represented as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If P, then Q (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\nPremise 2: Not Q (The cat was not outside)\nConclusion: Not P (The dog was not inside)\n\nThis argument form is known as modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P is also false.\n\nIn this case, the argument follows the modus tollens form, so it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
