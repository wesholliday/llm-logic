The argument is in the form of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The modus tollens form is as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\n\u2234 Not P\n\nIn this case, P is 'the bear was in the cave' and Q is 'the wolf was in the den'. The argument follows the modus tollens form exactly, with the first premise being the conditional statement 'If P, then Q', the second premise being the negation of Q, and the conclusion being the negation of P.\n\nAnswer: yes",
