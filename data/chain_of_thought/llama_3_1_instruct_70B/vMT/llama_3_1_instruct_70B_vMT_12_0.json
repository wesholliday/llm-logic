            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. The argument is in the form of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The modus tollens form is as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\n\u2234 Not P\n\nIn this case, P is 'Joe went to the park', and Q is 'Lucy went to the zoo'. The first premise states 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo', which corresponds to 'If P, then Q'. The second premise states 'Lucy did not go to the zoo', which corresponds to 'Not Q'. The conclusion 'Joe did not go to the park' corresponds to 'Not P'.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, which is a valid form of argument, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
