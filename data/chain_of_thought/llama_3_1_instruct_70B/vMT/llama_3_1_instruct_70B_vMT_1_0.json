            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is as follows:\n\n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n2. Sue was not at the wedding.\n3. Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThis argument can be represented using propositional logic as follows:\n\n1. M \u2192 S (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\n2. \u00acS (Sue was not at the wedding)\n3. \u2234 \u00acM (Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding)\n\nThe argument form is an example of modus tollens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic. Modus tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (if A, then B) and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A is false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" We are given that Sue was not at the wedding, which allows us to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
