            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is in the form of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The modus tollens form is as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\n\u2234 Not P\n\nIn this case, P is 'Tom watched football' and Q is 'Jen watched basketball'. The argument follows the modus tollens form exactly, with the first premise being the conditional statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', the second premise being the negation of the consequent 'Jen did not watch basketball', and the conclusion being the negation of the antecedent 'Tom did not watch football'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
