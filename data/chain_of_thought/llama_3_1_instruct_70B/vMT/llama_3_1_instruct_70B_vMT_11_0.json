            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is in the form of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument in logic. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if A implies B, and B is false, then A must be false. \n\nIn this case, the first premise 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry' can be represented as 'A implies B', where A is 'the cake was chocolate' and B is 'the muffins were blueberry'. The second premise 'The muffins were not blueberry' can be represented as 'not B'. \n\nUsing the modus tollens rule, we can conclude that 'not A', which is 'the cake was not chocolate'. This matches the conclusion of the argument. Since the argument follows a valid form of reasoning, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
