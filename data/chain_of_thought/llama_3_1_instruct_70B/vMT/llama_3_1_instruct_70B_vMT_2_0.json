            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is as follows:\n\n1. If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n2. The unicorn was not in the forest.\n3. Therefore, the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nThis argument follows the form of modus tollens, which is a valid logical argument form. Modus tollens is as follows:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case, P represents 'the griffin was in the forest', and Q represents 'the unicorn was in the forest'. The argument matches the modus tollens form, which means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
