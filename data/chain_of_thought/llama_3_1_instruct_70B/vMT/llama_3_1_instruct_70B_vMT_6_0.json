            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. The argument is in the form of a modus tollens argument, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The modus tollens form is as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q\nNot Q\n\u2234 Not P\n\nIn this case, P is 'Sue chose pizza' and Q is 'Bob chose pasta'. The first premise states 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta', which corresponds to 'If P, then Q'. The second premise states 'Bob did not choose pasta', which corresponds to 'Not Q'. The conclusion 'Sue did not choose pizza' corresponds to 'Not P'.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus tollens form, which is a valid form of argument, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
