            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its form. The argument is in the form of a syllogism, specifically a modus tollens argument. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that follows this structure: \n\n1. If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n2. Not Q (The book is not a mystery novel)\n3. Therefore, Not P (The book was not written by James)\n\nIn modus tollens, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This is because if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P cannot be true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
