Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that follows this structure: \n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. Not Q\n3. Therefore, not P\n\nIn this case, P is 'the alien visited Mars' and Q is 'the robot visited Jupiter'. The argument follows the modus tollens structure, where the first premise is a conditional statement, the second premise is the negation of the consequent (Q), and the conclusion is the negation of the antecedent (P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
