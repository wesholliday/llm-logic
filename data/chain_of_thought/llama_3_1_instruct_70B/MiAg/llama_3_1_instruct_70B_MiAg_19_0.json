The given statements are 'The athlete might be wearing a red jersey' and 'The athlete might be stretching'. These statements are independent possibilities, and there is no information that contradicts the idea of the athlete doing both actions simultaneously. \n\nIn logic, this is related to the concept of 'might' or 'possibility', which allows for the combination of possibilities. Since both statements are possibilities, it is reasonable to infer that the athlete might be doing both actions at the same time.\n\nAnswer: yes",
