These statements are connected with 'and', which indicates a conjunction. However, the 'might' in each statement is a modal verb that expresses possibility, not certainty. When we combine these two statements with 'and', we are not necessarily implying that both events are happening together. Instead, we are stating that each event is possible separately. \n\nHowever, it is also possible to interpret the combined statement as allowing for the possibility that both events are happening together. The key point is that the original statements do not rule out the possibility of both events occurring simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: yes",
