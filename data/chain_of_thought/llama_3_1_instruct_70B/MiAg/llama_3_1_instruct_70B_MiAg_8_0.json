These statements are separate and do not necessarily imply that both conditions will occur together. The word 'might' in each statement indicates a possibility, but it does not guarantee that both possibilities will happen at the same time. \n\nIn logic, this is related to the concept of conjunction. The original statements are two separate possibilities, and combining them with 'and' would imply that both conditions are true at the same time, which is not necessarily the case here. \n\nHowever, it is possible to infer that the restaurant might be both expensive and busy, but this is not a direct logical consequence of the given statements. It's more of a plausible interpretation, as the two statements do not exclude the possibility of both conditions being true.\n\nAnswer: no",
