            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was plastic', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement directly tells us that 'The truck was metal'. The second statement is a conditional statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This statement implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, it does not provide any information about the doll's material if the truck is metal. \n\nIn other words, the conditional statement only guarantees the material of the truck if the doll is plastic, but it does not guarantee that the doll is plastic if the truck is metal. There could be other reasons why the truck is metal, and the doll's material could be anything. \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The doll was plastic' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
