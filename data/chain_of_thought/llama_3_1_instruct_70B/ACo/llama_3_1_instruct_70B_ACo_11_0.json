The first statement directly tells us that 'The muffins were blueberry'. The second statement is a conditional statement, 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. This statement implies that if the cake was indeed chocolate, then the muffins would be blueberry. However, it does not guarantee that the cake was chocolate just because the muffins were blueberry. There could be other reasons why the muffins were blueberry, and the cake's flavor is not necessarily tied to the muffins' flavor in this scenario.\n\nAnswer: no",
