            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Sue was at the wedding' is a direct assertion about Sue's presence at the wedding. The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement that implies Sue's presence at the wedding is dependent on Mary's presence. However, it does not guarantee that Mary was at the wedding. \n\nIn logic, this is an example of affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. The conditional statement only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would be at the wedding, but it does not provide any information about Mary's presence when Sue is at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot infer Mary's presence at the wedding from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
