            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book was written by James', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement, 'The book is a mystery novel', provides information about the book's genre. The second statement, 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel', is a conditional statement that implies a relationship between the book's author and its genre.\n\nHowever, this conditional statement does not guarantee that James is the only author who can write a mystery novel. It only states that if James wrote the book, then it would be a mystery novel. It does not rule out the possibility of other authors writing mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, even though we know the book is a mystery novel, we cannot conclude with certainty that it was written by James, as there could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: no",
