            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is on the shelf', let's break down the given statements. The first statement is 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table'. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table', which is the negation of the second option in the disjunction.\n\nUsing the rules of classical logic, if we negate one of the options in a disjunction, and the disjunction itself is still true, then the other option must be true. In this case, since it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table, the only remaining option is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
