The first statement is 'Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry'. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. The second statement is 'It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry', which is the negation of the second option in the disjunction.\n\nGiven the second statement, we know that the cookies do not have to be hidden in the pantry. Since the first statement is a disjunction and we know that the second option is not true, the only remaining option is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
