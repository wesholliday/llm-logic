The first statement is 'The splat was quanked', which is a direct assertion. The second statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked', which is a conditional statement. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (the splat was morphed) is true, then the consequence (the splat was quanked) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true: if the consequence is true, it does not necessarily mean the condition is true. \n\nIn this case, we know the consequence (the splat was quanked) is true from the first statement, but we cannot conclude that the condition (the splat was morphed) is true. There could be other reasons why the splat was quanked, not just because it was morphed.\n\nAnswer: no",
