The second statement is a conditional statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle was tinked'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (the whiffle was shanked) is met, then the consequence (the whiffle was tinked) must be true. However, the reverse is not necessarily true. Just because the consequence (the whiffle was tinked) is true, it does not mean the condition (the whiffle was shanked) must be true. There could be other reasons why the whiffle was tinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The whiffle was shanked' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
