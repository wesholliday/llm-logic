            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements and apply logical reasoning. The first statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants must have been denim\"). \n\nThe second statement is \"it's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\" This statement can be represented as \"not B.\" \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer that the shirt was not cotton (not A) based on these statements. According to the rules of logic, if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A\" using the rule of modus tollens. \n\nTherefore, we can apply modus tollens to the given statements: If the shirt was cotton (A), then the pants must have been denim (B), and it's not the case that the pants must have been denim (not B). This leads us to conclude that the shirt was not cotton (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
