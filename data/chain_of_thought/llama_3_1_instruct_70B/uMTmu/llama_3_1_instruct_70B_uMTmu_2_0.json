            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as \"If A, then B\" (where A is the griffin being in the forest and B is the unicorn being in the forest). The second statement is \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest,\" which can be represented as \"Not B.\"\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B,\" we can conclude \"Not A.\" In this case, if the griffin being in the forest implies the unicorn being in the forest, and it's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest, then we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
