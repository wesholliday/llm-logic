            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into two parts: \n1. If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is the car being red, and the consequence is the truck being blue.\n2. It's not the case that the truck must have been blue. This statement negates the consequence of the first statement.\n\nTo analyze this, we can use the concept of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequence is false, then the condition must be false. \n\nApplying modus tollens to the given statements, we can conclude that if the car being red implies the truck being blue, and it's not the case that the truck must have been blue, then the car cannot have been red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
