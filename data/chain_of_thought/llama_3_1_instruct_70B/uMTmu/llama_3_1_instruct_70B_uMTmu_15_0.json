            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into two parts: \n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train. This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the consequence (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n2. It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This statement negates the consequence of the first statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer that Sam did not take a plane, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. If Erin must have taken a train is not true, then the condition that led to this consequence (Sam taking a plane) cannot be true. This is because if Sam had taken a plane, then Erin must have taken a train, but we know that Erin must not have taken a train.\n\nTherefore, we can use the logical rule of modus tollens, which states that if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
