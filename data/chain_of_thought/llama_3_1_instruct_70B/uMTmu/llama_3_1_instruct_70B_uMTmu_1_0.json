            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into two parts. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\" This implies that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue's presence is guaranteed. However, the second statement contradicts this by saying it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that Sue's presence is not guaranteed.\n\nTo reconcile these two statements, we need to consider the conditions under which Sue's presence is not guaranteed. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue's presence would be guaranteed, which contradicts the second statement. Therefore, for the second statement to be true, Mary must not have been at the wedding. This is because if Mary was not at the wedding, then the condition for Sue's guaranteed presence is not met, and it's possible that Sue was not at the wedding, which aligns with the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
