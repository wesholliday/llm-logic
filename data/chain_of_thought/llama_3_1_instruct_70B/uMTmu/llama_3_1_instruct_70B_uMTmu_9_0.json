            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into two parts. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" \n\nThe second statement is the negation of the conclusion of the first statement: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"Not B.\"\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B,\" we can conclude \"Not A.\" \n\nIn this case, we have \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" and \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" Applying the modus tollens rule, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
