            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into two parts: \n1. If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel. This is a conditional statement, where 'the book was written by James' is the condition, and 'the book must be a mystery novel' is the consequence.\n2. It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. This statement negates the consequence of the first statement.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the condition must be false. In this case, the consequence (the book must be a mystery novel) is false, and the conditional statement (if the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel) is given as true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the condition (the book was written by James) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
