            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into two parts: \n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This is a conditional statement, where the condition is Tom watching football, and the consequence is Jen watching basketball.\n2. It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This statement negates the consequence of the first statement.\n\nTo determine if Tom watched football, we need to analyze the relationship between the condition and the consequence. If the consequence (Jen watching basketball) is not true, then we can infer that the condition (Tom watching football) is also not true. This is based on the principle of modus tollens, which states that if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\nIn this case, since it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
