            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the doll was plastic\" and B is \"the truck must have been metal.\" \n\nThe second statement is the negation of B: \"it's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This can be represented as \"not B.\" \n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A.\" \n\nIn this case, we have \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" and \"it's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" Applying the modus tollens rule, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
