            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into two parts: \n1. If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This is a conditional statement, often represented as 'If A, then B' or A \u2192 B, where A is 'the apple was red' and B is 'the banana must have been yellow'. \n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This statement can be represented as 'not B'.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can analyze the situation. If A \u2192 B and not B, we can infer that not A. This is known as modus tollens, a valid logical argument form.\n\nIn this case, if the apple being red (A) implies the banana must have been yellow (B), and we know the banana must not have been yellow (not B), we can conclude that the apple was not red (not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
