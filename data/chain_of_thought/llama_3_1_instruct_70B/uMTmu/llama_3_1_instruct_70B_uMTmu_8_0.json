            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement says that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This is a conditional statement, often represented as \"if A, then B\" or A \u2192 B, where A is the condition (the vampire was awake) and B is the consequence (the mummy must have been awake).\n\nThe second statement says that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This can be represented as \u00acB (not B), where B is the statement that the mummy must have been awake.\n\nUsing these two statements, we can apply a logical rule called modus tollens. Modus tollens states that if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA. In this case, A is the statement that the vampire was awake, and B is the statement that the mummy must have been awake.\n\nApplying modus tollens, we can conclude that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake (A \u2192 B), and it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake (\u00acB), therefore, the vampire was not awake (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
