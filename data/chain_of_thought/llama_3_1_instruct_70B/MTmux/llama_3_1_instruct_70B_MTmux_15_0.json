            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical approach. The given statements can be broken down into two parts: \n\n1. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened. This is a conditional statement, often represented as 'If A, then B' or A \u2192 B, where A is 'the dreb was vroombed' and B is 'the dreb must have been spened'.\n\n2. It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened. This statement is the negation of B, often represented as \u00acB.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically the rule of modus tollens, we can infer the following: If A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA. In this case, A is 'the dreb was vroombed' and B is 'the dreb must have been spened'. \n\nApplying modus tollens to the given statements, we can conclude that if the dreb was vroombed implies the dreb must have been spened, and it's not the case that the dreb must have been spened, then it's not the case that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
