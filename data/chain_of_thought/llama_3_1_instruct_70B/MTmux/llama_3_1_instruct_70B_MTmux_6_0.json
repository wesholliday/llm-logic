            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical argument. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink'. This can be represented as 'A \u2192 B', where A is 'the grommet was sploffed' and B is 'the grommet must have plopped the frink'. \n\nThe second statement is the negation of B, which can be represented as '\u00acB' or 'It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink'. \n\nUsing the rule of modus tollens, which states that if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA, we can infer that if the grommet was sploffed implies the grommet must have plopped the frink, and it's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
