            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning. The given statements can be translated into logical expressions. Let's denote 'The sneg was crampled' as 'C', 'The sneg must have sproted the frink' as 'S'. \n\nThe first statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink' can be written as 'C \u2192 S'. \n\nThe second statement 'It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink' can be written as '\u00acS' (not S).\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled', which is '\u00acC'. \n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if 'A \u2192 B' and '\u00acB', then '\u00acA'. \n\nApplying this rule to our statements, we have 'C \u2192 S' and '\u00acS', so we can conclude '\u00acC'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
