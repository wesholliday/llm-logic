            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical argument. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or A \u2192 B, where A is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and B is \"the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n\nThe second statement is the negation of B: \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled,\" which can be represented as \u00acB.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically the rule of modus tollens, we can infer that if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA. In this case, if \"the sprocket was cranked\" implies \"the sprocket must have been daggled\" and it's not the case that \"the sprocket must have been daggled,\" then we can conclude that \"the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
