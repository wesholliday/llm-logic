            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into their logical components. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled'. This can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the wug was sproinged' and B is 'the wug must have been garpled'.\n\nThe second statement is the negation of the conclusion of the first statement: 'It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled', which can be represented as 'Not B'.\n\nWe are trying to determine if we can infer 'The wug was not sproinged', which is 'Not A'. \n\nIn logic, the rule of inference we are looking for is called 'modus tollens', which states that if we have 'If A, then B' and 'Not B', we can infer 'Not A'. \n\nSince we have 'If A, then B' (the first statement) and 'Not B' (the second statement), we can apply modus tollens to infer 'Not A'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
