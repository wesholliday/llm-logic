            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical argument form known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that 'not B', then we can conclude 'not A'. \n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged' (If A, then B) and the statement 'It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged' (not B). \n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that 'not A', which in this case is 'The clug was not fleeked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
