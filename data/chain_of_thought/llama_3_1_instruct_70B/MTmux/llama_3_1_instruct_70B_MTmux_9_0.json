            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning. The given statements can be translated into logical expressions. Let's denote 'the twonk was plinked' as P and 'the twonk must have been varnished' as V. \n\nThe first statement 'If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished' can be written as P \u2192 V (if P, then V). \n\nThe second statement 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished' can be written as \u00acV (not V).\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'The twonk was not plinked', which is \u00acP (not P).\n\nUsing the given statements, we can apply the rule of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of P \u2192 V is \u00acV \u2192 \u00acP. Since we have \u00acV, we can infer \u00acP.\n\nAnswer: yes",
