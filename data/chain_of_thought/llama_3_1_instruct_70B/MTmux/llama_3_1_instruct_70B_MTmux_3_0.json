            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical argument. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked'. This can be represented as 'Morphed \u2192 Quanked'. The second statement is the negation of the conclusion of the first statement: 'It's not the case that the splat must have quanked', which can be represented as '\u00acQuanked'.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically the rule of modus tollens, we can infer the negation of the antecedent (the 'if' part) from the negation of the consequent (the 'then' part). In this case, if we know that the splat must not have quanked (\u00acQuanked), we can infer that the splat was not morphed (\u00acMorphed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
