If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged (If A, then B)\n2. It's not the case that the glip must have tragged (Not B)\n\nWe can apply the rule of modus tollens, which states that if A implies B and B is false, then A must be false. In this case, if the glip was slogged (A) implies that the glip must have tragged (B), and we know that it's not the case that the glip must have tragged (Not B), then we can conclude that the glip was not slogged (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
