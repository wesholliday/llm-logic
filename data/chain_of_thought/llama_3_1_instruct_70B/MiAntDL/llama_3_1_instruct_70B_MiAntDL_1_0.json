            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The envelope might be under a bed or upstairs' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possible locations for the envelope. In a disjunction, if either of the options is true, the entire statement is true. Since 'under a bed' is one of the options presented, we can infer that it is indeed a possible location for the envelope. This is because the statement explicitly mentions 'under a bed' as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
