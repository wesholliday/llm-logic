            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document might be signed' from 'The document might be signed or notarized', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement. The original statement is in the form 'A or B', where A is 'The document might be signed' and B is 'The document might be notarized'. In a logical 'or' statement, if either A or B (or both) is true, the entire statement is true. Therefore, if the document might be signed, the original statement is true, regardless of whether it might be notarized or not. This means that 'The document might be signed' is a possible scenario that makes the original statement true, so we can indeed infer it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
