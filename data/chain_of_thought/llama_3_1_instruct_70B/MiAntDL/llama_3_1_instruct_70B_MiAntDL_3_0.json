In a disjunction, if either of the options is true, the entire statement is true. To infer 'The keys might be in the drawer', we need to determine if the original statement allows for this possibility. Since 'in the drawer' is one of the options presented in the disjunction, it is indeed a possible location for the keys according to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
