            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'The sprocket might not have been daggled' implies that it is possible the sprocket was not daggled, but it does not confirm it. The second statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled' is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between cranking and daggling. \n\nIf we assume the sprocket was cranked, then according to the second statement, it must have been daggled. However, the first statement suggests that it might not have been daggled. This creates a contradiction, as the sprocket cannot both be daggled and not daggled at the same time. \n\nGiven this contradiction, we can conclude that our initial assumption (the sprocket was cranked) must be false. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
