This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the customer was served' and B is 'he was not served promptly'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The new statement is of the form 'If C, then not A', where C is 'the customer was served promptly'. \n\nThe original statement does not provide any direct information about what happens when the customer is served promptly. It only tells us that if the customer was served, then he was not served promptly. This does not necessarily imply that if the customer was served promptly, he was not served. \n\nIn fact, the two statements are not logically equivalent, and the new statement is not a valid inference from the original statement. The original statement only provides information about the relationship between being served and being served promptly, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between being served promptly and being served.\n\nAnswer: no",
