However, it does not necessarily mean that discussing the issue in depth is equivalent to not discussing it at all.\n\nIn fact, the original statement only provides information about the relationship between discussing the issue and discussing it in depth, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between discussing the issue in depth and not discussing it at all.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer 'If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed' from the original statement, as it would be an unjustified assumption.\n\nAnswer: no",
