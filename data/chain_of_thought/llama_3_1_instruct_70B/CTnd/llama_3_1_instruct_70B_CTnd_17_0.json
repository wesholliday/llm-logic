The original statement is 'If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly'. This statement implies that if a greeting occurred, it was not a warm one. However, it does not provide information about the existence of a greeting if it is warm. \n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted'. This statement is actually the opposite of what the original statement implies. The original statement says that if a greeting occurred, it was not warm, but it does not say that a warm greeting cannot occur. In fact, the original statement does not provide any information about the existence or non-existence of a warm greeting. \n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the statement 'If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
