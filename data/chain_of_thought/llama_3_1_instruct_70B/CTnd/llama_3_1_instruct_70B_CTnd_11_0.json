            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store' from 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. \n\nThe original statement 'If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables' implies that going to the store and buying vegetables are mutually exclusive events. However, it does not provide information about what happens if we do buy vegetables. \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer, 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store', is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we are trying to infer 'If B, then not A', which is not the same as the contrapositive.\n\nIn this case, we can actually infer the contrapositive, which would be 'If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store'. However, the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and we can indeed infer it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
