The inferred statement is of the form 'If B, then not A'. \n\nIn logic, 'If A, then not B' does not necessarily imply 'If B, then not A'. This is because the original statement only tells us that if the job was completed, it was not completed well, but it does not provide any information about the relationship between the job being completed well and the job being completed.\n\nIn other words, it is possible that the job was completed well, and it was also completed. The original statement does not rule out this possibility. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If the job was completed well, then it was not completed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
