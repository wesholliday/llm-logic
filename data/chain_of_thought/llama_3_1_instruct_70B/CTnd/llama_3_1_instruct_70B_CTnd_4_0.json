            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently' can be broken down into two parts: the condition (or antecedent) 'Ben studied' and the consequence (or consequent) 'he did not study diligently'. This statement implies that studying and studying diligently are mutually exclusive, but it does not provide information about the relationship between studying diligently and not studying.\n\nTo infer 'If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study', we would need to know that studying diligently and studying are mutually exclusive, which is not directly stated in the original statement. However, we can make an educated inference based on the given information.\n\nIf Ben studied, then he did not study diligently, which implies that studying and studying diligently cannot happen at the same time. Therefore, if Ben studied diligently, it would contradict the condition 'Ben studied' in the original statement, suggesting that he did not study.\n\nAnswer: yes",
