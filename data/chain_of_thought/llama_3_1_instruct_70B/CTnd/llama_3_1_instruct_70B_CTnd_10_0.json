The original statement implies that any advice offered was not helpful. However, it does not explicitly state that helpful advice was never offered. It only states that if advice was offered, it was not helpful. \n\nThe proposed inference 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered' is essentially saying that helpful advice and offered advice are mutually exclusive. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to support this conclusion. It only tells us about the quality of the advice that was offered, not that helpful advice was never offered.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer 'If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
