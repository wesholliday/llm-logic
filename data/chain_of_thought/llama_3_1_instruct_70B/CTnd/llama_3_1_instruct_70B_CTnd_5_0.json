The given statement is 'If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly'. This statement implies that if the room was cleaned, it was not done thoroughly, but it does not provide information about the relationship between 'cleaned thoroughly' and 'not cleaned'.\n\nThe statement we're trying to infer is 'If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned'. This statement is actually the opposite of what the given statement implies. The given statement says that if the room was cleaned, it was not done thoroughly, but it does not imply that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, it was not cleaned.\n\nIn fact, the given statement and the statement we're trying to infer are not logically equivalent. The given statement is saying that 'cleaned' implies 'not cleaned thoroughly', but it does not say that 'cleaned thoroughly' implies 'not cleaned'. These are two different implications, and we cannot logically infer the second implication from the first one.\n\nAnswer: no",
