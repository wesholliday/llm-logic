The new statement is in the form of \"If C, then not A,\" where C is \"directions were explained clearly\" and not A is \"directions were not provided.\"\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about what happens when directions are explained clearly. It only tells us what happens when directions are provided (they are not explained clearly). Therefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
