This statement implies that exercising and exercising strenuously are mutually exclusive events. However, it does not provide any information about the relationship between not exercising strenuously and not exercising. The statement we are trying to infer, 'If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise', can be represented as 'If B, then not A'. This statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In fact, it is the contrapositive of the original statement's negation. The original statement does not provide enough information to infer this new statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
