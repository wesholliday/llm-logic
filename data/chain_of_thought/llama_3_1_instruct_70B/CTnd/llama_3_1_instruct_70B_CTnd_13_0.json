            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much' implies that exercising and exercising much are mutually exclusive events. However, it does not provide information about the relationship between exercising much and not exercising. The statement only tells us that if Alex exercised, he did not exercise much, but it does not tell us what happens if Alex exercised much. \n\nIn particular, the statement does not imply that exercising much is equivalent to not exercising. It is possible that Alex exercised much, and this is a different scenario from the one described in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer 'If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
