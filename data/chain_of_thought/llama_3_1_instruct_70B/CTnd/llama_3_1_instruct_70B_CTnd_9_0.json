This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then B', where A is 'instructions were given' and B is 'they were not explained clearly'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The inferred statement is in the form of 'If C, then not A', where C is 'instructions were explained clearly' and not A is 'instructions were not given'. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when instructions are explained clearly. It only tells us what happens when instructions are given (they are not explained clearly). Therefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
