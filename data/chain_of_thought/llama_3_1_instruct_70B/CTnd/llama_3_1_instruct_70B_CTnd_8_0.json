The original statement is 'If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively'. This statement implies that addressing the issue does not necessarily mean it was addressed effectively. \n\nHowever, the statement we are trying to infer is 'If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed'. This statement is saying that if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed at all, which is the opposite of what the original statement is saying.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the issue is addressed effectively. It only talks about the scenario where the issue is addressed, but not effectively. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about what happens when the issue is addressed effectively based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
