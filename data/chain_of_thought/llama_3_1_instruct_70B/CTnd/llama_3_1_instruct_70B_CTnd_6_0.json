The original statement is 'If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly'. This statement implies that if the clothes were washed, there was a problem with the washing process. \n\nHowever, the proposed conclusion 'If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed' is trying to make a connection between proper washing and the clothes not being washed at all. This conclusion is not logically supported by the original statement. The original statement does not provide any information about the relationship between proper washing and the clothes not being washed. \n\nIn fact, the proposed conclusion is trying to make an inverse relationship between proper washing and washing, which is not implied by the original statement. The original statement only talks about the quality of washing, not the existence of washing.\n\nAnswer: no",
