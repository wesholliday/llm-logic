            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, we need to analyze the original statement and the proposed inference. The original statement is 'If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation'. This statement implies that any recommendation made is not strong.\n\nThe proposed inference is 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made'. This statement seems to be the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we need to be careful with the negation of 'a strong recommendation was made' and 'a recommendation was made'.\n\nThe original statement implies that 'a recommendation was made' and 'a strong recommendation was made' are mutually exclusive events. If a recommendation was made, it cannot be strong, and if a strong recommendation was made, it cannot be just a recommendation (it must be a strong one). \n\nHowever, the proposed inference is not the exact contrapositive of the original statement. The correct contrapositive would be 'If a recommendation was strong, then no recommendation was made', which is not the same as the proposed inference.\n\nBut, considering the original statement, we can still make a logical inference. If a strong recommendation was made, it would contradict the original statement that any recommendation made is not strong. Therefore, we can infer that if a strong recommendation was made, then it cannot be a recommendation as per the original statement, which implies that a recommendation was not made.\n\nAnswer: yes",
