The original statement only tells us that if the meal was prepared, it was not prepared carefully, but it does not provide any information about what happens if the meal was prepared carefully.\n\nIn fact, the original statement and the statement we are trying to infer are not logically equivalent, and the latter is not a valid conclusion from the former.\n\nAnswer: no",
