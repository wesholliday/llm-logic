            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a categorical statement. The conditional statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', which can be represented as 'A \u2192 B', where A is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The categorical statement is 'Mark bought the blue shirt', which is B.\n\nIn logic, the given statements can be analyzed using the rule of modus ponens, which states that if A \u2192 B and B are true, then A is not necessarily true. However, modus ponens does not apply here because the given statements are in the wrong order. Modus ponens requires A \u2192 B and A to deduce B, but we have A \u2192 B and B.\n\nInstead, we can analyze the given statements using the rule of affirming the consequent, which states that if A \u2192 B and B are true, then we cannot logically deduce A. This is because there could be other reasons why B is true, and A is not the only possible cause of B.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
