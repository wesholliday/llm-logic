The first statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', which can be represented as 'If A, then B' or A \u2192 B. The second statement is 'Amy played tennis', which is the consequent (B) of the conditional statement. \n\nIn logic, this is an example of affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. It does not logically follow that if the consequent (Amy played tennis) is true, then the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) must also be true. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, and it is not necessarily related to Jeff playing basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
