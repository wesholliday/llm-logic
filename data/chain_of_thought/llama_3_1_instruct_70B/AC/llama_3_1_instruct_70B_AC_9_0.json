            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a categorical statement. The conditional statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', which can be represented as 'A \u2192 B' where A is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The categorical statement is 'Mark bought the blue shirt', which is B.\n\nIn logic, this is an example of affirming the consequent. The conditional statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B is true. However, it does not guarantee that if B is true, then A is true. There could be other reasons why B is true, and A might not be one of them.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer 'Lisa bought the red shirt' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
