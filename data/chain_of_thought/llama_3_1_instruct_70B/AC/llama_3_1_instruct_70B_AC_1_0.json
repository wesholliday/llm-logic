            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and a categorical statement. The conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' implies that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that the condition is true if the consequence is true. The categorical statement 'Sue was at the wedding' confirms that the consequence is true, but it does not provide any information about the condition.\n\nIn logical terms, this is an example of affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. It is not a valid logical argument to conclude that the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true simply because the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
