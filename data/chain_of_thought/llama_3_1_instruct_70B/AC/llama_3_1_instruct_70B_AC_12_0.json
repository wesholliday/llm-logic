This type of statement only guarantees the truth of B if A is true, but it does not guarantee the truth of A if B is true. In other words, just because Lucy went to the zoo, it does not necessarily mean that Joe went to the park. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo that are unrelated to Joe's actions.\n\nAnswer: no",
