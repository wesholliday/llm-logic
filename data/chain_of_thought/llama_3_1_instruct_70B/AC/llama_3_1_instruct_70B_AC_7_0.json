The first statement is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race', which is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B'. The second statement is 'Chris finished the race', which is the consequent (B) of the conditional statement. \n\nIn logic, this is known as affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. It does not necessarily mean that the antecedent (A) is true. In other words, just because Chris finished the race, it does not mean that Alex finished the race. There could be other reasons why Chris finished the race, and Alex may not have finished the race at all.\n\nAnswer: no",
