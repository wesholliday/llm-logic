            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into logical expressions and then apply the rules of inference. \n\nLet's denote 'The book was written by James' as 'J' and 'The book must be a mystery novel' as 'M'. The first statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' can be expressed as 'J \u2192 M'. The second statement 'It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel' can be expressed as '\u00acM'.\n\nWe are trying to infer 'The book was not written by James', which can be expressed as '\u00acJ'. \n\nUsing the rules of inference, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if 'J \u2192 M' and '\u00acM', then '\u00acJ'. This rule is applicable here because we have the condition 'J \u2192 M' and the negation of the consequent '\u00acM'. \n\nTherefore, we can infer '\u00acJ' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
