            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning. The given statements can be broken down into two parts: \n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry (If A, then B).\n2. It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry (Not B).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if A implies B and B is false, then A must be false. In this case, A is 'the cake was chocolate' and B is 'the muffins must have been blueberry'. \n\nSince we know that the muffins must not have been blueberry (Not B), we can infer that the cake was not chocolate (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
