            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into logical expressions and then apply the rules of inference. \n\nLet's denote 'Tom watched football' as 'T' and 'Jen must have watched basketball' as 'J'. The first statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball' can be expressed as 'T \u2192 J'. The second statement 'It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball' can be expressed as '\u00acJ'.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer 'Tom did not watch football' (\u00acT) from these statements. To do this, we can use the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that if 'A \u2192 B' and '\u00acB', then '\u00acA'.\n\nApplying this rule to our statements, we have 'T \u2192 J' and '\u00acJ'. According to the contrapositive inference rule, we can conclude '\u00acT', which means 'Tom did not watch football'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
