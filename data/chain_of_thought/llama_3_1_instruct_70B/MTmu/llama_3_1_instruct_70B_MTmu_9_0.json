            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" or A \u2192 B, where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe second statement is the negation of the conclusion of the first statement: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \u00acB, where \u00ac denotes negation.\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" which is \u00acA.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA. In this case, we have A \u2192 B (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt) and \u00acB (It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt). Therefore, we can conclude \u00acA (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nAnswer: yes",
