            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim'. This statement implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim, but it does not provide any information about the pants if the shirt is not cotton.\n\nThe second statement is 'It's not the case that the pants must have been denim', which can be rewritten as 'The pants do not necessarily have to be denim'. This statement does not provide any direct information about the shirt, but it does tell us that the condition 'the pants must have been denim' is not met.\n\nNow, let's combine the two statements. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim, but we know that the pants do not necessarily have to be denim. This means that the condition 'the shirt was cotton' cannot be true, because if it were true, the pants would have to be denim, which is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
