            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let's denote 'Ben ate pasta' as P and 'Kate must have eaten the salad' as K. The first statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad' can be expressed as P \u2192 K (if P, then K). The second statement 'It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad' can be expressed as \u00acK (not K).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer 'Ben did not eat pasta' (\u00acP) from these statements. To do this, we can use the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that if P \u2192 K and \u00acK, then \u00acP.\n\nIn this case, we have P \u2192 K and \u00acK, so we can apply the contrapositive inference rule to conclude that \u00acP (Ben did not eat pasta).\n\nAnswer: yes",
