            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into logical expressions and then apply the rules of logic to determine the conclusion.\n\nLet's denote 'Mary was at the wedding' as M and 'Sue must have been at the wedding' as S. The first statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' can be expressed as 'M \u2192 S' (if M, then S).\n\nThe second statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding' can be expressed as '\u00acS' (not S).\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', which is '\u00acM' (not M).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the contrapositive rule to the first statement 'M \u2192 S'. The contrapositive of 'M \u2192 S' is '\u00acS \u2192 \u00acM'. Since we know '\u00acS' (Sue must not have been at the wedding), we can conclude '\u00acM' (Mary was not at the wedding) using the contrapositive rule.\n\nAnswer: yes",
