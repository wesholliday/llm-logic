            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake'. This can be represented as 'V \u2192 M', where 'V' represents 'the vampire was awake' and 'M' represents 'the mummy must have been awake'. \n\nThe second statement is the negation of 'M', which can be represented as '\u00acM' or 'not M'. \n\nWe want to determine if we can infer '\u00acV' (the vampire was not awake) from these two statements. \n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if we have 'V \u2192 M' and '\u00acM', we can infer '\u00acV'. \n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
