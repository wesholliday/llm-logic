            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into their logical components. The first statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'Jeff played basketball' and B is 'Amy must have played tennis'. \n\nThe second statement is 'It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis', which is the negation of B. In logical terms, this can be represented as 'not B'.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' (not A) from these two statements. According to the rules of logical inference, if we have 'If A, then B' and 'not B', we can infer 'not A' using the rule of modus tollens. \n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
