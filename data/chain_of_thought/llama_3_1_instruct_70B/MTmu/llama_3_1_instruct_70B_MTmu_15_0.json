            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into logical expressions. Let's denote 'Sam took a plane' as P and 'Erin must have taken a train' as Q. The first statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train' can be expressed as P \u2192 Q. The second statement 'It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train' can be expressed as \u00acQ.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer 'Sam did not take a plane' (\u00acP) from these statements. To do this, we can use the rule of contrapositive inference, which states that if P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP.\n\nApplying this rule to our statements, we have P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ. According to the rule of contrapositive inference, we can conclude \u00acP, which means 'Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
