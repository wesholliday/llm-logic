            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical argument. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal'. This can be represented as 'P \u2192 M', where 'P' is 'the doll was plastic' and 'M' is 'the truck must have been metal'. The second statement is the negation of 'M', which can be represented as '\u00acM' or 'not M'. \n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if 'P \u2192 M' and '\u00acM', then '\u00acP'. In this case, '\u00acP' means 'the doll was not plastic'. \n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The doll was not plastic' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
