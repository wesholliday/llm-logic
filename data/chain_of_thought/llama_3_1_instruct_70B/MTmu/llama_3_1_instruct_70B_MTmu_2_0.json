            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest'. This can be represented as 'G \u2192 U', where 'G' represents 'the griffin was in the forest' and 'U' represents 'the unicorn must have been in the forest'.\n\nThe second statement is the negation of 'U', which can be represented as '\u00acU'. We are asked to determine if we can infer '\u00acG' (the griffin was not in the forest) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if we have 'A \u2192 B' and '\u00acB', we can infer '\u00acA'. In this case, we have 'G \u2192 U' and '\u00acU', so we can apply modus tollens to infer '\u00acG'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
