            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into their logical components. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" where A is \"Joe went to the park\" and B is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\nThe second statement is the negation of B: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" which can be represented as \"Not B.\"\n\nIn logic, the rule of inference we are looking for is called \"modus tollens.\" Modus tollens states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"Not B,\" we can infer \"Not A.\" \n\nApplying modus tollens to our problem, we have \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" (If A, then B) and \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" (Not B). Therefore, we can infer \"Not A,\" which is \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
