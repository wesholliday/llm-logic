            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into their logical components. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow'. This can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the apple was red' and B is 'the banana must have been yellow'.\n\nThe second statement is the negation of the conclusion of the first statement: 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow', which can be represented as 'Not B'.\n\nIn logic, the rule of inference we are applying here is called 'modus tollens'. Modus tollens states that if we have 'If A, then B' and 'Not B', we can infer 'Not A'. \n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements, we have 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' (If A, then B) and 'It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow' (Not B). Therefore, we can infer 'The apple was not red' (Not A).\n\nAnswer: yes",
