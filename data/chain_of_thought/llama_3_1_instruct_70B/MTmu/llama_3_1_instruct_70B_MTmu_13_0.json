            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to break down the given statements into their logical components. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue'. This can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the car was red' and B is 'the truck must have been blue'. \n\nThe second statement is the negation of the conclusion of the first statement: 'It's not the case that the truck must have been blue', which can be represented as 'Not B'. \n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer 'The car was not red' (Not A) from these two statements. In logic, this is known as the 'modus tollens' rule, which states that if we have 'If A, then B' and 'Not B', we can conclude 'Not A'. \n\nIn this case, we have 'If A, then B' (the car was red implies the truck must have been blue) and 'Not B' (it's not the case that the truck must have been blue). Therefore, we can apply the modus tollens rule to conclude 'Not A', which is 'The car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
