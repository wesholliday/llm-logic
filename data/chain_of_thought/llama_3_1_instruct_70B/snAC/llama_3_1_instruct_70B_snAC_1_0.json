            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, often represented as 'If A, then B' or A \u2192 B. In this case, A is 'Mary was at the wedding' and B is 'Sue was at the wedding'. We are also given that B ('Sue was at the wedding') is true. \n\nHowever, the truth of B does not necessarily imply the truth of A. The conditional statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B must be true. It does not guarantee that if B is true, then A must be true. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nFor example, consider the statement 'If it rains, then the streets will be wet'. If the streets are indeed wet, it does not necessarily mean that it rained. There could be other reasons why the streets are wet, such as a burst pipe or a street cleaning operation.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
