If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (If A, then B).\n2. The book is a mystery novel (B).\n\nWe are asked to determine if it necessarily follows that 'The book was written by James' (A) is true. \n\nIn this case, we are dealing with a classic example of the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The first statement establishes a relationship between A and B, but it does not guarantee that A is the only possible cause of B. There could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\nTherefore, even though we know the book is a mystery novel (B), we cannot conclude with certainty that it was written by James (A), as there could be other possible authors.\n\nAnswer: no",
