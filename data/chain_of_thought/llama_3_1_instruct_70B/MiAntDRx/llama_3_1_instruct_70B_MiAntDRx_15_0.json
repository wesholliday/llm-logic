The word 'or' in this context indicates that 'zazzle zizz zibber' and 'blurble' are two possible alternatives for what 'The zibber might be'. Since 'blurble' is explicitly mentioned as one of the possibilities, we can conclude that 'The zibber might be blurble' is indeed a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
