In a disjunction, if either of the alternatives is true, the entire statement is true. The statement does not imply that both alternatives must be true at the same time. Therefore, we can infer that 'The quibble might be in the fizzle' is one of the possible alternatives presented in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
