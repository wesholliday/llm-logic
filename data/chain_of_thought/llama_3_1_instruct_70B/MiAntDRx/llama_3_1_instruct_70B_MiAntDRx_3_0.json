In a disjunction, if either of the alternatives is true, the entire statement is true. The statement does not rule out the possibility of the fribble being on the wumble; in fact, it explicitly mentions this as one of the possibilities. Therefore, we can logically infer that the fribble might indeed be on the wumble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
