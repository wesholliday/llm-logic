'The student might pass the exam' implies that there is a possibility of the student passing the exam, but it does not explicitly state that there is no possibility of the student failing. \n\nIn fact, the use of 'might' in the original statement suggests uncertainty, which leaves room for other possibilities, including the possibility of the student failing. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the student might fail or pass the exam, as this statement encompasses both possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
