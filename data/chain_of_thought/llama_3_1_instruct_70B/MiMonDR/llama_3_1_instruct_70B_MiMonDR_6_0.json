            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The movie might be interesting' suggests that there is a possibility the movie is interesting, but it does not explicitly state that it might be boring. However, the word 'might' implies uncertainty, which could be interpreted as leaving room for other possibilities, including the movie being boring. This is because 'might' is a modal verb that expresses possibility, and in this context, it could be seen as implying that there are multiple possible outcomes, not just the one mentioned (interesting). \n\nAnswer: yes",
