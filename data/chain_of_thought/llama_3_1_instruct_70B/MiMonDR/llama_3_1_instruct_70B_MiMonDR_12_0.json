However, the word 'might' implies that there is some level of uncertainty, and it is reasonable to assume that if the food might be spicy, it could also be mild, as 'might' does not rule out other possibilities. This is a case of a reasonable inference, where we are making an educated guess based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
