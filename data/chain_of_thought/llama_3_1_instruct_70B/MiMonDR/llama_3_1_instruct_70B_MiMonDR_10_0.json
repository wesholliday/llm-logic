            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The computer might be working or broken' from 'The computer might be broken', we need to analyze the meaning of the original statement. The phrase 'might be broken' implies that there is a possibility of the computer being broken, but it does not rule out the possibility of it working. In other words, 'might be broken' does not necessarily mean it is definitely broken, but rather that it could be broken. This leaves room for the possibility that the computer is working. Therefore, we can infer that the computer might be working or broken, as this statement encompasses both possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
