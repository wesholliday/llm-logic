            "content": "Explanation: The statement 'The flight might be delayed' implies that there is a possibility of the flight being delayed, but it does not explicitly state that the flight will definitely be on time. However, it also does not rule out the possibility of the flight being on time. The word 'might' indicates uncertainty, suggesting that there are multiple possible outcomes. Since 'might be delayed' does not exclude the possibility of the flight being on time, we can infer that the flight might be either on time or delayed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
