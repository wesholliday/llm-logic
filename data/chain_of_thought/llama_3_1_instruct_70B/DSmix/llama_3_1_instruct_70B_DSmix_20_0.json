The first statement 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'The fleeg might not be surned' implies that it is possible for the fleeg not to be surned, but it does not rule out the possibility of it being surned. \n\nHowever, if we combine these two statements, we can see that if the fleeg is not surned (as per the second statement), then according to the first statement, it must be bluttered, since the disjunction requires at least one of the conditions to be true. \n\nAnswer: yes",
