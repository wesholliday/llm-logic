This statement only provides information about the situation when A (Sue chose pizza) is true. It does not provide any information about the situation when A is false (Sue did not choose pizza). \n\nIn logic, the given statement does not imply the converse, which would be 'If Sue chose pasta, then Bob chose pizza', nor does it imply the inverse, which would be 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta'. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement, and we cannot infer it from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
