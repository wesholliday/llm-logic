This statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the cake and muffins when the cake is not chocolate. In other words, it does not imply that if the cake is not chocolate, the muffins cannot be blueberry. The statement only guarantees that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins are blueberry, but it does not restrict the muffins to being blueberry only when the cake is chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
