            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the griffin was in the forest' and B is 'the unicorn was in the forest'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference. The proposed inference is of the form 'If not A, then not B'. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the griffin is not in the forest. It only tells us what happens when the griffin is in the forest. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the proposed statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
