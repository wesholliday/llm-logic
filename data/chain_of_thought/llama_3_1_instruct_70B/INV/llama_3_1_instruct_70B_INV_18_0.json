            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B'. To determine if we can infer 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference.\n\nThe proposed inference is of the form 'If not A, then not B'. This is known as the inverse of the original statement. However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, just because 'If A, then B' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'If not A, then not B' is also true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement only tells us that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. It does not provide any information about what happens if the doll is not plastic. The truck could still be metal, or it could be something else entirely. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
