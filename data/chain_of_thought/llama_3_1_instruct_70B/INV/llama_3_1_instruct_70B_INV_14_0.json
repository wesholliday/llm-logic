            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the bear was in the cave' and B is 'the wolf was in the den'. This statement does not provide any information about the situation when the bear is not in the cave. It only tells us what happens when the bear is in the cave. \n\nIn logic, this type of statement is often represented as A \u2192 B. The inverse of this statement would be \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB, which is 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den'. However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, just because A \u2192 B is true, it does not necessarily mean that \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB is also true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
