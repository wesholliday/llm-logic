This statement does not provide any information about the case where the book was not written by James. It only guarantees that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. However, it does not rule out the possibility that a book not written by James could also be a mystery novel. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the book was not written by James, then it is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
