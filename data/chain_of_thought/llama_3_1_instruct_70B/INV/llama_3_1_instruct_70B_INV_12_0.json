            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"Joe went to the park\" and B is \"Lucy went to the zoo\"). This type of statement does not provide any information about what happens if A is false. In other words, it does not guarantee that if A is false, B will also be false. \n\nIn logic, the statement \"If A, then B\" is often represented as A \u2192 B. The negation of A \u2192 B is not \"If not A, then not B\", but rather \"A and not B\". The correct contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \"If not B, then not A\". \n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" from the given statement. However, we can infer \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\".\n\nAnswer: no",
