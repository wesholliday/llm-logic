            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B'. To determine if we can infer 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference.\n\nThe proposed inference is of the form 'If not A, then not B'. This is known as the inverse of the original statement. However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, just because 'If A, then B' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'If not A, then not B' is also true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement only tells us what happens when Tom watches football (Jen watches basketball), but it does not provide any information about what happens when Tom does not watch football. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
