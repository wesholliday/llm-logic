This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the dog was inside' and B is 'the cat was outside'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference. The proposed inference is of the form 'If not A, then not B'. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the dog is not inside. It only tells us what happens when the dog is inside. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
