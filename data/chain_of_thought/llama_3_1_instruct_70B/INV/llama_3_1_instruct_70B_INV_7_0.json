            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the face'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B'. To determine if we can infer 'If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference.\n\nThe proposed inference is of the form 'If not A, then not B'. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. However, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, but only if the original statement is also true in the reverse direction (i.e., 'If B, then A'). \n\nIn this case, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens if Chris finishes the race, or if Alex doesn't finish the race. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
