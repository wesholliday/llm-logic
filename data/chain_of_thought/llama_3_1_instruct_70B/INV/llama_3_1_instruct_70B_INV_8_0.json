            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B'. This statement does not provide any information about the situation when the vampire is not awake. It only guarantees that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. However, it does not rule out the possibility that the mummy could be awake even if the vampire is not awake. \n\nIn order to infer 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake', we would need a statement of the form 'If not A, then not B', which is the contrapositive of the original statement. However, the contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A', not 'If not A, then not B'. The contrapositive of the original statement would be 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake'. \n\nTherefore, we cannot directly infer 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
