This statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the shirt and pants when the shirt is not cotton. It only guarantees that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants are denim. However, it does not rule out the possibility that the pants could be denim even if the shirt is not cotton. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
