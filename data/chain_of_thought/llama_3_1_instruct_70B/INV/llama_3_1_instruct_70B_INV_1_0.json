This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Mary was at the wedding' and B is 'Sue was at the wedding'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference. The proposed inference is of the form 'If not A, then not B'. \n\nHowever, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding. It only tells us what happens when Mary is at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
