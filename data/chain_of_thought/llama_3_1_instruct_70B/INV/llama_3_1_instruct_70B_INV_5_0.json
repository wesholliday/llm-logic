            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B'. To determine if we can infer 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference.\n\nThe proposed inference is of the form 'If not A, then not B'. This is known as the inverse of the original statement. However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, just because 'If A, then B' is true, it does not necessarily mean that 'If not A, then not B' is also true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. It does not provide any information about what happens if Jeff does not play basketball. Amy may or may not play tennis if Jeff does not play basketball. Therefore, we cannot logically infer 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
