            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\" (A \u2192 B), where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\". This statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the negation of A (the apple was not red) and the negation of B (the banana was not yellow). \n\nIn logic, the negation of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is not equivalent to \"If not A, then not B\". The correct negation of \"If A, then B\" is \"A and not B\". Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
