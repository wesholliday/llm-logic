            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic. Modus ponens is defined as follows: \n\n1. If P, then Q (If-then statement)\n2. P (Premise)\n3. \u2234 Q (Conclusion)\n\nIn this case, the argument matches the modus ponens form:\n\n1. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (If-then statement)\n2. Sam took a plane (Premise)\n3. \u2234 Erin took a train (Conclusion)\n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens form, which is a valid argument form, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
