            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic. Modus ponens has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. P\n3. \u2234 Q (Therefore Q)\n\nIn this case, the argument matches this structure:\n\n1. If Ben ate pasta (P), then Kate ate salad (Q)\n2. Ben ate pasta (P)\n3. \u2234 Kate ate salad (Q)\n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens form, which is a valid argument form, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
