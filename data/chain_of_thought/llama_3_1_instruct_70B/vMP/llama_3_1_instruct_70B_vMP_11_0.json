            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. Modus ponens is defined as follows: \n\n1. If P, then Q (If-then statement)\n2. P (Premise)\n3. \u2234 Q (Conclusion)\n\nIn this case, the argument matches the modus ponens form:\n\n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (If-then statement)\n2. The cake was chocolate (Premise)\n3. \u2234 The muffins were blueberry (Conclusion)\n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens form, which is a valid form of argument, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
