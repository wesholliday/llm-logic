            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. The argument has the form of a modus ponens argument, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. The modus ponens form is as follows: \n\n1. If P, then Q\n2. P\n3. \u2234 Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'Jeff played basketball' and Q is 'Amy played tennis'. The first premise is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', which matches the 'If P, then Q' part of the modus ponens form. The second premise is 'Jeff played basketball', which matches the 'P' part of the modus ponens form. The conclusion 'Amy played tennis' matches the '\u2234 Q' part of the modus ponens form.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens form, which is a valid form of argument, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
