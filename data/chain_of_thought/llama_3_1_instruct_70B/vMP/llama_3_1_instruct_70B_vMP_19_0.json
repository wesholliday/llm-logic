            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic. Modus ponens is defined as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q\nP\n\u2234 Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'Tom watched football', and Q is 'Jen watched basketball'. The first premise 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' corresponds to 'If P, then Q', and the second premise 'Tom watched football' corresponds to 'P'. The conclusion 'Jen watched basketball' corresponds to 'Q'. Since the argument follows the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
