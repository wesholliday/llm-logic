            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states: if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must be true. In this case, the first premise 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is the conditional statement (P implies Q), the second premise 'The book was written by James' is the antecedent (P), and the conclusion 'The book is a mystery novel' is the consequent (Q). \n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens form, and modus ponens is a valid argument form, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
