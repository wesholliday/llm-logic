            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic. Modus ponens is defined as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q\nP\n\u2234 Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'The griffin was in the forest', and Q is 'The unicorn was in the forest'. The first premise 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest' corresponds to 'If P, then Q', and the second premise 'The griffin was in the forest' corresponds to 'P'. The conclusion 'The unicorn was in the forest' corresponds to 'Q'.\n\nSince the argument follows the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
