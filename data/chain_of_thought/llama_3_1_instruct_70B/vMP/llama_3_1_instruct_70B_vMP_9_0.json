            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic. Modus ponens is defined as follows:\n\nIf P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\nP\n\u2234 Q\n\nIn this case, P is 'Lisa bought the red shirt', and Q is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The first premise 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' corresponds to 'If P, then Q', and the second premise 'Lisa bought the red shirt' corresponds to 'P'. The conclusion 'Mark bought the blue shirt' corresponds to 'Q'.\n\nSince the argument follows the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
