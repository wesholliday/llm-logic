            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine its form. The argument is in the form of modus ponens, which is a valid argument form in classical logic. Modus ponens is defined as follows: \n\n1. If P, then Q (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow)\n2. P (The apple was red)\n3. \u2234 Q (The banana was yellow)\n\nIn modus ponens, if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This is because the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between P and Q, and the second premise asserts that P is true. Therefore, it logically follows that Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
