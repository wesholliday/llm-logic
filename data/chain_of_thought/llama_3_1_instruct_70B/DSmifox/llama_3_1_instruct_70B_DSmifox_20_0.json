The first statement is 'The fleeg might not be surned', which implies that it is possible for the fleeg not to be surned. The second statement is 'Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered', which presents two possibilities: the fleeg is surned, or it is bluttered.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that it is possible for the fleeg not to be surned. If the fleeg is not surned, then according to the second statement, it must be bluttered, as those are the only two options presented.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not confirm that the fleeg is not surned; it only says it might not be. Therefore, we cannot be certain that the fleeg is bluttered, as it is still possible for the fleeg to be surned.\n\nAnswer: no",
