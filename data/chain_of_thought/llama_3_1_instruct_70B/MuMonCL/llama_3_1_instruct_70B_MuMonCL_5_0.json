            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been delivered today' from 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conjunction of two events: 'The package must have been delivered today' and 'The package must have been signed for'. In a conjunction, both events must be true for the entire statement to be true. \n\nIf we remove the second event ('The package must have been signed for') from the original statement, we are left with 'The package must have been delivered today'. Since the original statement asserts that both events must have occurred, it logically follows that 'The package must have been delivered today' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
