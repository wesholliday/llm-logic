            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been signed' from 'The document must have been signed and notarized', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. The original statement is a conjunction of two conditions: 'signed' and 'notarized'. In a conjunction, both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the document must have been both signed and notarized, it logically follows that the document must have been signed, as 'signed' is one of the conditions in the conjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
