            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have been sold out' from the given statement, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM' is a conjunction of two separate statements: 'The concert must have been sold out' and 'The concert started at 8 PM'. \n\nIn a conjunction, both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the original statement is true, then both 'The concert must have been sold out' and 'The concert started at 8 PM' must also be true. \n\nThis means that we can indeed infer 'The concert must have been sold out' from the original statement, as it is a part of the conjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
