The statement is a conjunction of two conditions: the password being eight characters long and the password including a number. Since the statement is a conjunction, both conditions must be true. Therefore, we can infer that the password must have been eight characters long, as it is one of the conditions in the conjunction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
