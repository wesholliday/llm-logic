The original statement is 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays and served Italian cuisine'. This is a compound statement consisting of two parts: 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays' and 'served Italian cuisine'. \n\nIn logic, when two statements are connected by 'and', both statements must be true for the entire compound statement to be true. Therefore, if the compound statement is true, then both 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays' and 'served Italian cuisine' must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
