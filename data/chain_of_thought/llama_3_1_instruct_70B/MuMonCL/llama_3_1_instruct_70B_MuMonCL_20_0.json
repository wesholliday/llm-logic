The statement is a conjunction of two conditions: 'The event must have been formal' and 'required tickets'. In a conjunction, both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, it logically follows that 'The event must have been formal' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
