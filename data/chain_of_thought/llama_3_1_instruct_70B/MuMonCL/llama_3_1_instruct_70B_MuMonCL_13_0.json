If both conditions are met, then it is true that the movie must have been in English. The presence of subtitles does not contradict the movie being in English; in fact, it is possible for a movie to be in English and still have subtitles. Therefore, we can logically deduce that if the movie meets both conditions, it must indeed be in English.\n\nAnswer: yes",
