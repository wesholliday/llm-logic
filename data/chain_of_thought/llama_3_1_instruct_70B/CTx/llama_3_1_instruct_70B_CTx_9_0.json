This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the twonk was plinked' and B is 'it was varnished'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked', we need to check if this is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. \n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished' is indeed 'If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked'. This is because we are negating both the condition (A) and the consequence (B) and swapping their positions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
