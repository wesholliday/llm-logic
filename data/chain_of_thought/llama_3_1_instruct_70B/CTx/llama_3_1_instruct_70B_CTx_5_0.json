            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement. The original statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" This is a classic example of a conditional statement, where the first part (the zinger was fraggled) is the antecedent, and the second part (the zinger was smoogled) is the consequent.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled,\" we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the new statement. The new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and then switching their positions.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the original statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled,\" and its contrapositive is indeed \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
