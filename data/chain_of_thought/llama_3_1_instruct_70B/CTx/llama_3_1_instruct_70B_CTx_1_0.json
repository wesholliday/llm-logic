            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument and the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is 'If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled'. To determine if we can infer 'If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed', we need to examine the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement is in the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the flugel was blimmed' and B is 'the flugel was zargled'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not B, then not A', which is 'If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed'. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
