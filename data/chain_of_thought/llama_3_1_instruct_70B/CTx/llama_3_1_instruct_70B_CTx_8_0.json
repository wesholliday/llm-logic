            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement. The original statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This is a classic example of a conditional statement, where the first part (the sprocket was cranked) is the antecedent, and the second part (the sprocket was daggled) is the consequent.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked,\" we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the new statement. The new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and then swapping them.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" is indeed \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\" In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
