            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement. The original statement is \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This is a classic example of a conditional statement, where the first part (the fribble was snurgled) is the antecedent, and the second part (the fribble crinked) is the consequent.\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement, we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the new statement. The new statement is \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and then swapping them. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" Since the new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
