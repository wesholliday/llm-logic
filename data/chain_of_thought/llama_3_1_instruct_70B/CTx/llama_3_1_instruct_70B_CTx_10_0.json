            "content": "Explanation: This question involves a logical argument and the concept of contrapositive. The original statement is 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'. To determine if we can infer 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged', we need to check if the second statement is the contrapositive of the first.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. In this case, 'A' is 'the wug was sproinged' and 'B' is 'the wug was garpled'. The contrapositive would be 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged'.\n\nSince the second statement matches the contrapositive of the first statement, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
