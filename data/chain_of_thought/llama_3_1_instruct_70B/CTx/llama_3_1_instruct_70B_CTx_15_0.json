This is a conditional statement, which implies that if A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nHowever, it does not provide any information about what happens if A is false or if B is false. The statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B is true, but it does not guarantee that if B is false, then A is false.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is in the form of 'If not B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. \n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
