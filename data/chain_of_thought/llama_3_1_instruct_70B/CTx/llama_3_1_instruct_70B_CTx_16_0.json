            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement. The original statement is \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This is a classic example of a conditional statement, where \"the sneg was crampled\" is the antecedent (or condition) and \"the sneg sproted the frink\" is the consequent (or result).\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement, we need to apply the rules of logical inference. The new statement is \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent and then swapping them. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" Since the new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
