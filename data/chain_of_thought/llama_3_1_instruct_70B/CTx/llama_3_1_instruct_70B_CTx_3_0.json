            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed' from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements. The original statement is in the form of 'If A, then B', where A is 'the splat was morphed' and B is 'the splat quanked'. \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is in the form of 'If not B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the statements, we can infer 'If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed' from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
