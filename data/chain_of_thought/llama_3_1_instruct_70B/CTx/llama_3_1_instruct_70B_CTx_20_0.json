            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement. The original statement is \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This is a classic example of a conditional statement, where \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is the antecedent (or condition) and \"it surned\" is the consequent (or result).\n\nTo determine if we can infer the second statement, we need to apply the rules of logical inference. The second statement is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
