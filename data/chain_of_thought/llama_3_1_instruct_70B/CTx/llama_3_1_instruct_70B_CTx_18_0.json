            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement. The original statement is \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This is a classic example of a conditional statement, where \"the shank was plooked\" is the antecedent (or condition) and \"the shank was nugged\" is the consequent (or result).\n\nTo determine if we can infer the new statement \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked,\" we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the new statement. The new statement is essentially the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\" The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" The contrapositive would be \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
