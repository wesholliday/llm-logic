            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical argument form known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that 'B' is false, then we can conclude that 'A' is also false.\n\nIn this case, the conditional statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. We are also given that 'The book is not a mystery novel', which is the negation of the consequent (B). \n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is also false, which means 'The book was not written by James'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
