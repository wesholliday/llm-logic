            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This statement implies that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that if the condition is false, the consequence will be false as well.\n\nThe second statement is 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt', which directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. Since the consequence is false, we can infer that the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) must also be false. This is because if the condition were true, the consequence would have to be true as well, according to the first statement.\n\nThis type of logical reasoning is known as modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
