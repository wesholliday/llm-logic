            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Jeff did not play basketball', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This statement implies that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that if the condition is false, the consequence will be false as well.\n\nThe second statement is 'Amy did not play tennis', which directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. Since we know Amy did not play tennis, we can use this information to analyze the first statement. If Jeff had played basketball, then according to the first statement, Amy would have played tennis, which we know is not true. Therefore, the condition (Jeff playing basketball) must be false, because if it were true, it would lead to a contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
