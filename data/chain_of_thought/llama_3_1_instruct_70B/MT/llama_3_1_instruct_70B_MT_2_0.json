            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The griffin was not in the forest', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest'. This statement implies that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. However, it does not provide any information about the griffin's location if the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nThe second statement is 'The unicorn was not in the forest'. This statement tells us that the unicorn is not in the forest, but it does not directly tell us anything about the griffin's location.\n\nHowever, we can use the first statement to make an inference. Since the unicorn is not in the forest, and the first statement says that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must be in the forest, we can conclude that the griffin cannot be in the forest. If the griffin were in the forest, then the unicorn would have to be in the forest, but we know that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
