            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'. This statement implies that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. However, it does not provide any information about the doll if the truck is not metal. The second statement, 'The truck was not metal', tells us that the truck is indeed not metal. \n\nUsing the first statement, we can conclude that if the doll was plastic, the truck would have to be metal, but since the truck is not metal, we can infer that the doll cannot be plastic. This is an example of the logical rule of contrapositive inference, where 'If A then B' and 'not B' implies 'not A'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
