            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'. This statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also be at the wedding. However, it does not provide any information about the situation where Mary is not at the wedding.\n\nThe second statement is 'Sue was not at the wedding'. This statement tells us that Sue was indeed not at the wedding. Now, we need to combine this information with the first statement. Since Sue was not at the wedding, and the first statement says that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would be at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary must not have been at the wedding. This is because if Mary were at the wedding, Sue would also be at the wedding, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
