            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Alex did not finish the race', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'A \u2192 C', where A is 'Alex finished the race' and C is 'Chris finished the race'. The second statement 'Chris did not finish the race' is the negation of C, which can be represented as '\u00acC'. \n\nUsing the rule of modus tollens in logic, which states that if A \u2192 C and \u00acC, then \u00acA, we can infer that if Alex finished the race (A) implies Chris finished the race (C), and we know Chris did not finish the race (\u00acC), then we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
