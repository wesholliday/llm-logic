            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The car was not red' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the argument. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. This statement implies that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, it does not provide any information about the color of the truck if the car is not red.\n\nThe second statement is 'The truck was not blue'. This statement tells us that the truck is not blue, but it does not provide any direct information about the color of the car.\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The car was not red', we need to consider the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' is 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'. Since we know that the truck was not blue (from the second statement), we can use the contrapositive to infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
