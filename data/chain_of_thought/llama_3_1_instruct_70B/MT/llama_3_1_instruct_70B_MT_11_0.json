            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement and a negation. The given statements are: \n1. If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (If P, then Q).\n2. The muffins were not blueberry (Not Q).\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate', we need to analyze the relationship between the statements. The first statement is a conditional statement, which only guarantees the truth of the second statement (muffins were blueberry) if the first statement (cake was chocolate) is true. However, it does not guarantee the falsity of the second statement if the first statement is false.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the muffins were not blueberry. Using the concept of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement 'If P, then Q' is true and 'Not Q' is true, then we can conclude 'Not P'. In this case, we can apply modus tollens to the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
