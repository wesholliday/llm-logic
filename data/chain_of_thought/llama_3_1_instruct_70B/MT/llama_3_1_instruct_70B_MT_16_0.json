            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This statement implies that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if the shirt is not cotton. The second statement is 'The pants were not denim'. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if the shirt is cotton, the pants must be denim. But since we know the pants are not denim, we can conclude that the condition 'the shirt is cotton' must not be true, because if it were true, the pants would be denim, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
