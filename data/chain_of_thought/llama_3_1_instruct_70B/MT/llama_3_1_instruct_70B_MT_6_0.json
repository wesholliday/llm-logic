            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue did not choose pizza', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B'. The second statement 'Bob did not choose pasta' is the negation of the consequence 'B'. \n\nIn a conditional statement 'If A, then B', if the consequence 'B' is false, we can infer that the antecedent 'A' is also false. This is known as the modus tollens rule in logic. Applying this rule to the given statements, we can conclude that if Bob did not choose pasta (B is false), then Sue did not choose pizza (A is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
