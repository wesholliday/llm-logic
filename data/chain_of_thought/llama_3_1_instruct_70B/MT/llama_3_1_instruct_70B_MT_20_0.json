            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument using modus tollens. The given statements are: \n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (If P, then Q)\n2. The banana was not yellow (Not Q)\n\nIn modus tollens, if we have 'If P, then Q' and 'Not Q', we can infer 'Not P'. Applying this rule to the given statements, we can conclude that if the banana was not yellow, then the condition 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow' is not satisfied, which implies that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
