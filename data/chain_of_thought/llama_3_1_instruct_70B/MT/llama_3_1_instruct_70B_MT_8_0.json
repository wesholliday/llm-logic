            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The vampire was not awake', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'V \u2192 M', where 'V' represents 'The vampire was awake' and 'M' represents 'The mummy was awake'. The second statement 'The mummy was not awake' can be represented as '\u00acM', where '\u00ac' denotes negation.\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if 'A \u2192 B' and '\u00acB', then '\u00acA'. In this case, 'A' is 'The vampire was awake' and 'B' is 'The mummy was awake'. Since we have 'V \u2192 M' and '\u00acM', we can conclude '\u00acV', which means 'The vampire was not awake'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
