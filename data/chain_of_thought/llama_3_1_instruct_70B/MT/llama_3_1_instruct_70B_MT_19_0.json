            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Tom did not watch football', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Tom watching football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true. However, if the consequence is false, we can infer that the condition is also false. \n\nThe second statement is 'Jen did not watch basketball', which directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. Since the consequence is false, we can use the principle of modus tollens, which states that if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, then the condition must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
