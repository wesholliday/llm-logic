            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'. This statement implies that if the condition (Joe went to the park) is true, then the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that if the condition is false, the consequence will be false as well.\n\nThe second statement is 'Lucy did not go to the zoo', which directly contradicts the consequence of the first statement. Now, we need to determine if we can infer 'Joe did not go to the park' from these two statements.\n\nUsing the concept of modus tollens, which is a rule of inference in logic, we can conclude that if the consequence of a conditional statement is false, and the conditional statement itself is true, then the condition must be false. In this case, the consequence (Lucy went to the zoo) is false, and the conditional statement is given as true. Therefore, we can apply modus tollens to infer that the condition (Joe went to the park) must be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
