The original statement only mentions that 'The zazzle must be glorp', but it does not provide any information about 'flump'. There is no logical connection or implication between 'glorp' and 'flump' in the given statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the additional information about 'flump' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
