To infer 'The zizz must be wump and quank a glorp', we would need additional information that connects 'the zizz' or 'wump' to 'quank a glorp'. However, no such connection is provided in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the additional information about 'quank a glorp' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
