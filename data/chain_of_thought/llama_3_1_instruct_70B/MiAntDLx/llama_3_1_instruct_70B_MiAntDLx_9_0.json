In a disjunction, if either of the possibilities is true, the entire statement is true. The statement does not guarantee that the quank is flonk, but it does not exclude the possibility either. Since 'The quank might be flonk' is one of the possibilities presented in the original statement, we can infer that it is indeed a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
