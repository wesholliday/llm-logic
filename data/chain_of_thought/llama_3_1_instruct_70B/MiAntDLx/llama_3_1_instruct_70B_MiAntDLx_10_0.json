The statement 'The wozzle might be shimble or flibbit' implies that there are two possible options for what the wozzle might be: shimble or flibbit. Since 'might be shimble' is one of the options, it is a part of the original statement.\n\nGiven that 'might be shimble' is a part of the original statement, we can logically infer that 'The wozzle might be shimble' is true, as it is one of the possibilities mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
