In a disjunction, if either of the alternatives is true, the entire statement is true. The statement does not guarantee that the fribble is on the blurble, but it does not exclude that possibility either. Since 'The fribble might be on the blurble' is one of the alternatives presented in the original statement, we can infer that it is indeed a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
