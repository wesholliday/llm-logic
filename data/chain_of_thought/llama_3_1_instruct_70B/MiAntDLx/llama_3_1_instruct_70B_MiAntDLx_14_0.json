Since 'a quimble' is one of the options, we can infer that 'The fizzle might be glorp' is indeed a possibility for 'a quimble'. This is because the 'or' in the original statement indicates that 'The fizzle might be glorp' is a possibility for at least one of the options, and 'a quimble' is one of those options.\n\nAnswer: yes",
