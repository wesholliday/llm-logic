The original statement 'The flonk might be frazzle' implies that there is a possibility of the flonk being frazzle. However, it does not provide any information about the flonk being quibble. The term 'quibble' is not present in the original statement, and there is no logical connection between 'frazzle' and 'quibble' that would allow us to infer the presence of 'quibble' based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
