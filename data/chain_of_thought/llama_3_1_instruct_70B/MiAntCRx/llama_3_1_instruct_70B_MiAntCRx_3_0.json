The original statement 'The grazzle might quazzle' implies that there is a possibility of the grazzle quazzling. However, it does not provide any information about the grazzle wibbling. The addition of 'wibble' in the inferred statement introduces a new action that is not present in the original statement. \n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about the grazzle wibbling, we cannot logically infer that the grazzle might wibble and quazzle based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
