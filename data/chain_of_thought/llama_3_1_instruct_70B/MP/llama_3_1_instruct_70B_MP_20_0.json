            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument using modus ponens, a rule of inference in logic. The given statements are: \n1. If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow (If P, then Q)\n2. The apple was red (P)\n\nModus ponens states that if we have 'If P, then Q' and 'P', we can infer 'Q'. In this case, 'P' is 'The apple was red' and 'Q' is 'The banana was yellow'. Since we have both 'If P, then Q' and 'P', we can apply modus ponens to infer 'Q', which is 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
