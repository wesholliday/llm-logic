            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a premise. The conditional statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel'. This statement implies that if the condition (the book being written by James) is true, then the conclusion (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true. The premise provided is 'The book was written by James', which confirms the condition of the conditional statement. \n\nGiven that the condition is true, we can logically infer the conclusion. This type of argument is known as modus ponens, a valid form of argument in logic. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement and its condition are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
