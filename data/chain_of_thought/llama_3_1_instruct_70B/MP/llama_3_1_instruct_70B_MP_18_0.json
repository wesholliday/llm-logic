            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was metal', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B' (where A is 'the doll was plastic' and B is 'the truck was metal'). The second statement 'The doll was plastic' confirms the condition A. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true, then the conclusion (B) must also be true. Since we know the doll was plastic (A is true), we can logically conclude that the truck was metal (B is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
