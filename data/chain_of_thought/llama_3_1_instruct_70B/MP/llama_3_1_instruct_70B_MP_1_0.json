            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a categorical statement. The conditional statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' sets up a relationship between the two events. The categorical statement 'Mary was at the wedding' provides information about one of the events. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Sue was at the wedding', we need to examine the relationship between the two statements. The conditional statement implies that if the condition (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true. Since we know that Mary was at the wedding, we can use this information to trigger the conditional statement and conclude that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
