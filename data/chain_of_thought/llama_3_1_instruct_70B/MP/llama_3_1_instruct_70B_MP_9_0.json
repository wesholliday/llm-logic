            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a premise. The conditional statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', which can be represented as 'A \u2192 B', where A is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. The premise is 'Lisa bought the red shirt', which is A. \n\nIn logic, this type of argument is called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement 'A \u2192 B' and we know that A is true, then we can infer that B is true. \n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' and we know that 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is true. Therefore, according to modus ponens, we can infer that 'Mark bought the blue shirt' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
