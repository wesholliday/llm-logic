            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a given fact. The conditional statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake' can be represented as 'V \u2192 M', where 'V' represents 'The vampire was awake' and 'M' represents 'The mummy was awake'. \n\nGiven the fact 'The vampire was awake' (V), we can use this information to determine the validity of the conclusion 'The mummy was awake' (M). \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (V) is true, and the statement is of the form 'if-then', then we can logically conclude that the consequence (M) is also true. This is known as modus ponens, a valid form of argument in logic.\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can infer that if the vampire was awake, and the conditional statement is true, then the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
