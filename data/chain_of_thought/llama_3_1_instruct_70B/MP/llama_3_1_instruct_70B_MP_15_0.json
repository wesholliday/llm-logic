            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement. The first statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Sam took a plane' and B is 'Erin took a train'. The second statement 'Sam took a plane' is the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement. \n\nIn logic, this type of argument is called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that A is true, then we can infer that B is true. \n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train' and we know that 'Sam took a plane' is true. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to infer that 'Erin took a train' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
