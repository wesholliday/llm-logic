            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a categorical statement. The conditional statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis' sets up a relationship between two events: Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis. The categorical statement 'Jeff played basketball' provides information about one of the events in the conditional statement.\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Amy played tennis', we need to examine the relationship between the two statements. The conditional statement implies that if the first event (Jeff playing basketball) occurs, then the second event (Amy playing tennis) must also occur. Since we know that Jeff played basketball, we can use this information to trigger the conditional statement and conclude that Amy played tennis.\n\nThis type of logical argument is called modus ponens, which is a valid form of argument in classical logic. It states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent (the 'if' part) is true, then the consequent (the 'then' part) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
