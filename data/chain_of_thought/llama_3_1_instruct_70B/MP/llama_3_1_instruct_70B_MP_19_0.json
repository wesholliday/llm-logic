            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement. The given statements are: \n1. If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (If P, then Q).\n2. Tom watched football (P).\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'Jen watched basketball' (Q), we need to analyze the structure of the argument. The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watched basketball) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true.\n\nIn logic, this type of argument is known as modus ponens, which is a valid argument form. It states that if P implies Q, and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
