            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a categorical statement. The conditional statement 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim' sets up a relationship between the two statements. The categorical statement 'The shirt was cotton' provides information about the shirt. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'The pants were denim', we need to examine the relationship between the statements. The conditional statement implies that if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the consequence (the pants being denim) must also be true. Since we know the shirt was cotton, we can apply this condition to the conditional statement.\n\nGiven that the condition is met (the shirt is cotton), we can logically conclude that the consequence (the pants being denim) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
