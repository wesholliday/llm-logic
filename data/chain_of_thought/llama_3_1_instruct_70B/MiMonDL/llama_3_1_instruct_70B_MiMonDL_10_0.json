            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The computer might be broken or working' from 'The computer might be broken', we need to analyze the meaning of the original statement. 'The computer might be broken' implies that there is a possibility that the computer is broken, but it does not exclude the possibility that it is working. In fact, the use of 'might' suggests that there is some uncertainty about the computer's state. \n\nWhen we consider the statement 'The computer might be broken or working', it is essentially saying that the computer could be in either of two states: broken or working. This statement encompasses the original possibility (the computer being broken) and adds another possibility (the computer being working). Since the original statement already implies uncertainty and does not rule out the possibility of the computer working, we can indeed infer that the computer might be broken or working.\n\nAnswer: yes",
