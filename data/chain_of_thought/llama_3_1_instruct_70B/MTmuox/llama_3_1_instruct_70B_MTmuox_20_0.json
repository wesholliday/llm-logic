            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can break it down into logical steps. Let's denote 'the fleeg was bluttered' as B and 'the fleeg was surned' as S. The given statements can be translated into logical expressions as follows:\n\n1. It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned: \u00acS (not S)\n2. If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned: B \u2192 S (if B, then S)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer 'The fleeg was not bluttered', which is \u00acB (not B).\n\nUsing the given statements, we can apply the rule of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of statement 2 is: \u00acS \u2192 \u00acB (if not S, then not B). Since we know \u00acS from statement 1, we can use this to infer \u00acB.\n\nAnswer: yes",
