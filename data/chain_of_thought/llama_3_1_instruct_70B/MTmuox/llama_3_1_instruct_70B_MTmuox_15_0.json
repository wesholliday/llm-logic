            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use logical reasoning. Let's break down the given statements:\n\n1. 'It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened' - This statement implies that it's not necessary for the dreb to have been spened. We can represent this as '\u00acN(S)' where 'N' denotes necessity and 'S' denotes the dreb being spened.\n\n2. 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened' - This statement implies that if the dreb was vroombed, then it's necessary for the dreb to have been spened. We can represent this as 'V \u2192 N(S)' where 'V' denotes the dreb being vroombed.\n\nNow, we want to infer 'The dreb was not vroombed', which we can represent as '\u00acV'. To do this, we can use the contrapositive of the second statement, which is '\u00acN(S) \u2192 \u00acV'. Since we already know '\u00acN(S)' from the first statement, we can conclude '\u00acV'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
