            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled' implies that it's possible the sprocket was not daggled. The second statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled' is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between cranking and daggling. \n\nIf the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled, but we know it's possible the sprocket was not daggled. This means that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it could not have been cranked, because cranking would have required daggling. However, we cannot conclude that the sprocket was not cranked with absolute certainty, because the first statement only says it's possible the sprocket was not daggled, not that it definitely was not daggled. \n\nHowever, we can use a process of elimination to determine the answer. If the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled, but we know it's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled. Therefore, we can conclude that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
