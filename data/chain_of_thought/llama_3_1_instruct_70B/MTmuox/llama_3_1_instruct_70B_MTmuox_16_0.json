(This can be represented as ~S, where S is the statement \"the sneg must have sproted the frink\".)\n2. If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink. (This can be represented as C \u2192 S, where C is the statement \"the sneg was crampled\".)\n\nWe want to determine if we can infer that the sneg was not crampled (~C). \n\nUsing the given statements, we can apply the rule of contrapositive inference. The contrapositive of the second statement is ~S \u2192 ~C. Since we know ~S (from the first statement), we can infer ~C.\n\nAnswer: yes",
