            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat might not have been morphed' from 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed', we need to break down the statements. The original statement 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' implies that there is no necessity for the splat to have been morphed. This means that the possibility of the splat not being morphed is not ruled out. \n\nIn other words, if it's not necessary for the splat to have been morphed, then it's possible that it wasn't morphed. This aligns with the statement 'The splat might not have been morphed', which expresses the possibility of the splat not being morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
