            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The flob might not have been skizzled' from 'It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled', we need to break down the given statement. The phrase 'It's not the case that' is a negation, and 'must have been' implies necessity. So, 'It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled' essentially means that it's not necessary for the flob to have been skizzled. This does not rule out the possibility that the flob was skizzled, but it also does not confirm it. The statement leaves room for other possibilities, including the possibility that the flob was not skizzled. Therefore, we can infer that the flob might not have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
