            "content": "Explanation: To determine the validity of the argument, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise states 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding', which can be translated to 'It's not necessary that Mary was at the wedding'. This implies that there is no requirement or obligation for Mary to be at the wedding.\n\nThe conclusion states 'Mary might not have been at the wedding', which means that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding. \n\nIn modal logic, 'must' is often associated with necessity, and 'might' is associated with possibility. The negation of necessity ('it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding') implies the possibility of the opposite ('Mary might not have been at the wedding'). This is because if something is not necessary, it means that the opposite is possible.\n\nTherefore, the argument seems to be logically valid, as the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
