The given statements are: 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' (P \u2192 Q) and 'Kate ate salad' (Q). We are asked to determine if 'Ben ate pasta' (P) is true. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (P) is true, then the consequence (Q) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true: if the consequence (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean that the condition (P) is true. There could be other reasons why Kate ate salad, not just because Ben ate pasta.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that 'Ben ate pasta' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
