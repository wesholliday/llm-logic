If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (If P, then Q).\n2. Jen watched basketball (Q).\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude that Tom watched football (P) based on these statements. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (P) is true, then the consequence (Q) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true: if the consequence (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean the condition (P) is true. There could be other reasons why Q is true.\n\nIn this case, we know that Jen watched basketball (Q), but we do not have enough information to conclude that Tom watched football (P) is the reason for this. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
