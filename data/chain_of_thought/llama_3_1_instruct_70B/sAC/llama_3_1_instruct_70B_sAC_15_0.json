If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train (If P, then Q).\n2. Erin took a train (Q).\n\nWe are asked to determine if it follows that Sam took a plane (P). \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (P) is true, then the consequence (Q) must also be true. However, the converse is not necessarily true: if the consequence (Q) is true, it does not necessarily mean the condition (P) is true. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train.\n\nIn this case, we are given that Erin took a train (Q), but we cannot conclude that Sam took a plane (P) solely based on this information. There might be other reasons why Erin took a train, unrelated to Sam's actions.\n\nAnswer: no",
