Amy played tennis (B)\n\nWe are asked to determine if Jeff played basketball (A) is true. \n\nIn logic, this is an example of affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. The truth of 'Amy played tennis' (B) does not necessarily imply that 'Jeff played basketball' (A) is true. There could be other reasons why Amy played tennis, and it's not necessarily related to Jeff playing basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
