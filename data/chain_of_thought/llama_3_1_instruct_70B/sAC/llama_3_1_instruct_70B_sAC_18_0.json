            "content": "Explanation: To determine if 'The doll was plastic' is true, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B' where A is 'The doll was plastic' and B is 'The truck was metal'. The second statement 'The truck was metal' confirms that B is true. However, this does not necessarily mean that A is true. In a conditional statement, if B is true, it does not guarantee that A is true, as there could be other reasons why B is true. This is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy.\n\nAnswer: no",
