The second statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the sprocket was cranked' and B is 'the sprocket was daggled'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true, then the consequence (B) must also be true. However, if the consequence (B) is false, we can infer that the condition (A) is also false. In this case, we know that the consequence (B) 'the sprocket was daggled' is false, as stated in the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the condition (A) 'the sprocket was cranked' is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
