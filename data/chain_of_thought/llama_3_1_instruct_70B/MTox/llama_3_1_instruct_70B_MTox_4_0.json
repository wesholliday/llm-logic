            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The fribble was not snurgled', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The fribble did not crink'. The second statement is 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the fribble was snurgled' and B is 'the fribble crinked'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if B is false, we can conclude that A is also false. In this case, we know that 'the fribble crinked' (B) is false from the first statement. Therefore, we can apply the rule of modus tollens, which states that if the conclusion of a conditional statement is false, then the premise must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
