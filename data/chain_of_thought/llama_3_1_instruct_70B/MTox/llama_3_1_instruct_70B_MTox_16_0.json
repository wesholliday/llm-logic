If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n\n1. \u00acS (The sneg did not sproted the frink)\n2. C \u2192 S (If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink)\n\nNow, we want to infer whether the sneg was crampled (C) or not. We can use the contrapositive of statement 2 to help us:\n\n\u00acS \u2192 \u00acC (If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled)\n\nSince we know that \u00acS (from statement 1), we can conclude that \u00acC (the sneg was not crampled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
