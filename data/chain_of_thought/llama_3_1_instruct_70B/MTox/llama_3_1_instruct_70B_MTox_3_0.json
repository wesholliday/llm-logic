            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat was not morphed', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The splat did not quank'. The second statement is 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'. This is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'the splat was morphed' and B is 'the splat quanked'. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that B ('the splat quanked') is false. In a conditional statement, if the consequent (B) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (A) is also false, but only if we know that the conditional statement is true. This is a valid logical argument known as modus tollens.\n\nIn this case, we are given that the conditional statement is true, so we can apply modus tollens. Since we know that 'the splat quanked' is false, we can conclude that 'the splat was morphed' is also false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
