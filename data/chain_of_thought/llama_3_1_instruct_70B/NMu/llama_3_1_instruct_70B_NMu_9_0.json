            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' from 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt', we need to break down the statements. The original statement 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' implies that there is no necessity or obligation for Lisa to buy the red shirt. This does not necessarily mean that she didn't buy it, but rather that it wasn't required or certain that she would buy it.\n\nThe statement 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' implies that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is a weaker statement than saying she definitely didn't buy it, but it does acknowledge that not buying the shirt is a possible outcome.\n\nGiven the original statement, we can see that it does not rule out the possibility of Lisa buying the red shirt, but it also does not guarantee that she bought it. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that there is a possibility that she might not have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
