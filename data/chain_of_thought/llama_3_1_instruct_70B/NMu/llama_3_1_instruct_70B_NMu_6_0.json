            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' from 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza', we need to break down the statements. The original statement 'It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza' implies that there is no necessity or obligation for Sue to choose pizza. This does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza, but rather that it was not required or certain that she would choose pizza.\n\nThe statement 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' implies that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This is a weaker statement than saying Sue did not choose pizza, as it leaves room for the possibility that she did choose pizza.\n\nConsidering the original statement, we can see that it does not guarantee that Sue chose pizza, nor does it guarantee that she did not choose pizza. However, it does imply that there is no certainty that she chose pizza, which leaves room for the possibility that she did not choose pizza. Therefore, we can infer that 'Sue might not have chosen pizza' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
