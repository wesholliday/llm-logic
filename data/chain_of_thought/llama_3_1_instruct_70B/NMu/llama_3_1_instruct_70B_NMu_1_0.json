            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary might not have been at the wedding' from 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding', let's break down the statements. The original statement 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' implies that there is no necessity or obligation for Mary to be at the wedding. This does not directly state that Mary was or was not at the wedding, but rather that it was not required for her to be there.\n\nHowever, if it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, it means that there is a possibility that she might not have been at the wedding. This is because 'must' typically implies a necessity or obligation, and if that necessity or obligation is absent, then the possibility of her not being at the wedding exists.\n\nAnswer: yes",
