The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This statement implies that if the condition (Mary being at the wedding) is true, then the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true: \"Mary was at the wedding.\" Since the condition is met, we can logically conclude that the consequence (Sue being at the wedding) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
