The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This statement implies that if the condition (the cake being chocolate) is true, then the consequence (the muffins being blueberry) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true: \"the cake was chocolate.\" Since the condition is true, we can logically conclude that the consequence must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
