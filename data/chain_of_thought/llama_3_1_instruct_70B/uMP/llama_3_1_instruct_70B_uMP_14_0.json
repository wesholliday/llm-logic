The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This statement implies that the presence of the bear in the cave is a sufficient condition for the wolf to be in the den. The second statement confirms that \"the bear was in the cave.\" Since the condition (bear in the cave) is met, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the wolf was indeed in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
