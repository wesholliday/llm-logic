The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This statement implies that if the condition (Tom watching football) is true, then the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true: \"Tom watched football.\" Since the condition is met, we can logically conclude that the consequence (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
