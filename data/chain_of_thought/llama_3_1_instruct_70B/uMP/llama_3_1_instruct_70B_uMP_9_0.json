            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a given fact. The conditional statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement implies that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the conclusion (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. We are also given the fact that Lisa bought the red shirt. \n\nUsing this information, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the condition is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, and the conditional statement is given as true. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
