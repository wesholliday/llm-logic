            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the truck was blue, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This statement sets up a relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. The second statement is a simple assertion: \"The car was red.\" This statement provides the condition that triggers the conditional statement.\n\nGiven that the car was indeed red, we can apply the conditional statement. Since the condition (the car being red) is met, we can infer the consequence (the truck being blue).\n\nAnswer: yes",
