The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This statement implies that if the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true: \"Sue chose pizza.\" Since the condition is met, we can logically conclude that the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
