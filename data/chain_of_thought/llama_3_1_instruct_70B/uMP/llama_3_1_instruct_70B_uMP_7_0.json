The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This statement implies that if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the consequence (Chris finishing the race) must also be true. The second statement confirms that Alex did finish the race. Since the condition is met, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
