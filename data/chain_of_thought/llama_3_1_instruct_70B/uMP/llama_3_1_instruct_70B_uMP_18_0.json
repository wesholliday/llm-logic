The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This statement implies that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the conclusion (the truck being metal) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true: \"the doll was plastic.\" Since the condition is met, we can logically conclude that the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
