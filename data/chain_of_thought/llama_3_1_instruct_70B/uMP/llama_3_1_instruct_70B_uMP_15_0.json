            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that Erin took a train, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This statement implies that if the condition (Sam taking a plane) is true, then the consequence (Erin taking a train) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true: \"Sam took a plane.\" Since the condition is met, we can logically conclude that the consequence (Erin taking a train) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
