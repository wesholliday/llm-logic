The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This statement implies that if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) is true, then the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true. The second statement confirms that Jeff played basketball. Since the condition in the first statement is met, we can logically conclude that the consequence (Amy playing tennis) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
