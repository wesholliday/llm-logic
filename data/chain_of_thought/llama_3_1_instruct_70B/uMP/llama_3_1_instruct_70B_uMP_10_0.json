The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This statement implies that the presence of the dog inside is a condition for the cat to be outside. The second statement confirms that the condition is met: \"the dog was inside.\" Since the condition is met, we can logically conclude that the consequence (the cat being outside) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
