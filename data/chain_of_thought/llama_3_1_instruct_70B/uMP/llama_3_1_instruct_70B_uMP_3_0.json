The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This statement implies that if the condition (the book being written by James) is true, then the conclusion (the book being a mystery novel) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true: \"the book was written by James.\" Since the condition is met, we can logically conclude that the book is a mystery novel, based on the given conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
