The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This statement implies that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true: \"The vampire was awake.\" Since the condition is met, we can logically conclude that the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
