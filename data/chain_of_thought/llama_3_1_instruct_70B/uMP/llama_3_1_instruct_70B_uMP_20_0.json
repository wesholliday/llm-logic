            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the banana was yellow, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This statement implies that if the condition (the apple being red) is true, then the consequence (the banana being yellow) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true: \"The apple was red.\" \n\nGiven that the condition is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
