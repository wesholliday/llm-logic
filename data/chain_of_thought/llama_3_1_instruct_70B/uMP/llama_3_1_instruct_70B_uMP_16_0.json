The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This statement implies that if the condition (the shirt being cotton) is true, then the conclusion (the pants being denim) must also be true. The second statement confirms that the condition is indeed true: \"the shirt was cotton.\" Since the condition is met, we can logically conclude that the pants were denim based on the given conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
