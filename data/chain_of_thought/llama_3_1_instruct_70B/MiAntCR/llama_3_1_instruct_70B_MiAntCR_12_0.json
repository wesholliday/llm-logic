The statement 'The project might be completed by Friday and be under budget' combines two separate pieces of information: the project's completion date (by Friday) and the project's budget status (under budget). Since the original statement only provides information about the budget status and not the completion date, we cannot infer the combined statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
