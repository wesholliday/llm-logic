The original statement only mentions the possibility of the exam covering all chapters, but it does not provide any information about the difficulty level of the exam. The inferred statement, however, adds the idea that the exam might be difficult, which is not present in the original statement. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the difficulty level, we cannot logically infer that the exam might be difficult based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
