            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package might be delivered today and signed for' from 'The package might be signed for', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The original statement 'The package might be signed for' implies that there is a possibility of the package being signed for, but it does not provide any information about the timing of the delivery. However, signing for a package typically occurs at the time of delivery. Therefore, if the package might be signed for, it is reasonable to assume that it might be delivered, and since signing for it is a possibility, it might be delivered and signed for. \n\nAnswer: yes",
