            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document might be signed and notarized' from 'The document might be notarized', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. Notarization typically involves verifying the authenticity of a signature on a document. However, the statement 'The document might be notarized' does not explicitly mention the presence of a signature. It only mentions the possibility of notarization, which could potentially involve other aspects of the document, such as verification of its authenticity or contents, without necessarily requiring a signature.\n\nHowever, in common practice, notarization is often associated with verifying the authenticity of a signature. Given this context, it's reasonable to assume that if a document is notarized, it likely involves a signature. Therefore, we can make an educated inference that if 'The document might be notarized', it's possible that 'The document might be signed and notarized'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
