            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is on the shelf', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table' presents two possible locations for the book. This is an 'or' statement, which means that at least one of the options must be true, but it doesn't have to be both. The second statement 'The book isn't resting on the table' eliminates one of the options, leaving us with only one possibility - the book being on the shelf. \n\nSince the first statement guarantees that the book is in one of the two locations, and the second statement eliminates the table as a possibility, we can logically conclude that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
