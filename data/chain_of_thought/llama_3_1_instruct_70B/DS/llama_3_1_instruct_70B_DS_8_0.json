            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The remote control is on the coffee table', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a disjunction (an 'or' statement), which means that at least one of the options must be true. The second statement negates one of the options in the disjunction, stating that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. \n\nGiven that the remote control cannot be hiding under the couch, we can eliminate this option from the disjunction. Since the disjunction states that the remote control is either on the coffee table or under the couch, and we know it's not under the couch, the only remaining option is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
