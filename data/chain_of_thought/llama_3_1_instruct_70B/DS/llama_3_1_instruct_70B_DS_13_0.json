            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The toy is in the toy box', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf' presents two possible locations for the toy. This is an example of a disjunction, where at least one of the options must be true. The second statement 'The toy isn't sitting on the shelf' eliminates one of the options, leaving only the other option as a possibility.\n\nGiven that the toy cannot be on the shelf, and the first statement says it must be in one of the two locations, we can logically conclude that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
