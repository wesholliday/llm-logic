            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Fido is inside', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden' is a disjunction, which means that at least one of the two options must be true. The second statement 'Fido is not in the garden' is a negation of one of the options in the disjunction. \n\nWhen we combine these two statements, we can use the process of elimination. Since we know Fido is not in the garden, we can eliminate that option. This leaves us with the only remaining option: 'Fido is inside'. \n\nIn logic, this is an example of the disjunctive syllogism, which states that if we have a disjunction (A or B) and we know that one of the options (B) is false, then we can conclude that the other option (A) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
