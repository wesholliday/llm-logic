            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The blurble might be blurble for a flump and the wumble might be snizzle' is a compound sentence consisting of two independent clauses: 'The blurble might be blurble for a flump' and 'the wumble might be snizzle'. Both clauses express possibilities or uncertainties, indicated by the word 'might'. \n\nWhen we consider the statement 'It might be that the blurble is blurble for a flump and the wumble is snizzle', we can see that it combines the two independent clauses into a single sentence with a compound predicate. The phrase 'It might be that' is a way of expressing a possibility or uncertainty about the entire situation described by the compound predicate.\n\nSince both the original statement and the new statement express the same possibilities and uncertainties, and the new statement simply rephrases the original statement in a different way, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
