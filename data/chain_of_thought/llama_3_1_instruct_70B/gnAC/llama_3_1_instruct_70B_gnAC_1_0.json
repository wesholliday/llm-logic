            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement, often represented as 'If A, then B' or A \u2192 B. In this case, A is 'Mary was at the wedding' and B is 'Sue was at the wedding'. We are also given that B ('Sue was at the wedding') is true. However, the truth of B does not necessarily imply the truth of A. This is because the conditional statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B is true, but it does not guarantee that if B is true, then A is true. There could be other reasons why B is true, even if A is false. Therefore, we cannot conclude that 'Mary was at the wedding' is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
