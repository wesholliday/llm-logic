If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (If A, then B).\n2. The book is a mystery novel (B).\n\nWe are asked to determine if it necessarily follows that 'The book was written by James' (A) is true. \n\nIn logic, this type of argument is known as affirming the consequent. The structure of the argument is as follows:\nIf A, then B\nB\n\u2234 A\n\nThis type of argument is considered a fallacy because it does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. There could be other reasons why the book is a mystery novel, and it does not necessarily mean that James wrote it. \n\nFor example, consider the statement 'If it rains, then the grass is wet.' If we know that the grass is wet, it does not necessarily mean that it rained. The grass could be wet due to other reasons, such as a sprinkler system or a flood.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot conclude that 'The book was written by James' is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
