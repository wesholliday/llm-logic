            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a hypothetical syllogism. The first statement 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink' is a conditional statement, where 'the sneg was crampled' is the antecedent (or condition) and 'the sneg sproted the frink' is the consequent (or result). The second statement 'The sneg was crampled' is the affirmation of the antecedent. \n\nIn a hypothetical syllogism, if the antecedent is affirmed, and the conditional statement is true, then we can logically infer the consequent. This is known as modus ponens. \n\nIn this case, we have the antecedent affirmed ('The sneg was crampled') and the conditional statement ('If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'). Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to infer the consequent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
