            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a conditional statement (if-then statement) and a premise. The conditional statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled', which can be represented as 'A \u2192 B' where A is 'the sprocket was cranked' and B is 'the sprocket was daggled'. The premise is 'The sprocket was cranked', which is A. \n\nIn logic, this type of argument is called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement A \u2192 B and we know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true. \n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' and we know that 'The sprocket was cranked'. Therefore, we can apply modus ponens to conclude that 'The sprocket was daggled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
