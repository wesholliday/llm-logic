            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument using a hypothetical syllogism. The first statement 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink' is a conditional statement, where 'the grommet was sploffed' is the antecedent (or condition) and 'the grommet plopped the frink' is the consequent (or result). The second statement 'The grommet was sploffed' is an assertion that the antecedent is true.\n\nGiven that the antecedent is true, we can use modus ponens, a rule of inference in logic, to conclude that the consequent is also true. Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement is true and the antecedent is true, then the consequent must be true.\n\nTherefore, by applying modus ponens to the given statements, we can infer that 'The grommet plopped the frink'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
