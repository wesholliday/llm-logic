            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding', let's break down the given statements. The first statement 'Sue might not have been at the wedding' implies that it's possible Sue was not at the wedding, but it doesn't confirm it. The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding' is a conditional statement that implies if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue's presence is guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between these statements. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. However, we know that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This creates a contradiction if we assume Mary was at the wedding, because if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding, but we know that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, because if she was, it would guarantee Sue's presence, which contradicts the possibility of Sue not being at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
