            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Joe did not go to the park', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Lucy might not have gone to the zoo' implies that it's possible Lucy didn't go to the zoo, but it doesn't provide any information about Joe. The second statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo' is a conditional statement that links Joe's action to Lucy's action. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo, but if Lucy didn't go to the zoo, it doesn't necessarily mean Joe didn't go to the park. However, since we know Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, and if Joe went to the park, Lucy must have gone to the zoo, we can infer that if Lucy didn't go to the zoo, then Joe couldn't have gone to the park. Since we have the possibility that Lucy didn't go to the zoo, we can conclude that Joe didn't go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
