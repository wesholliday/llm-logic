            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'The banana might not have been yellow' implies that the banana's color is uncertain, but it does not provide any information about the apple. The second statement 'If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow' is a conditional statement that links the color of the apple to the color of the banana. \n\nIf the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, but we know that the banana might not have been yellow. This means that if the banana was not yellow, the condition 'If the apple was red' cannot be true, because it would lead to a contradiction (the banana must have been yellow, but it might not have been). \n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the banana might not have been yellow, then the apple cannot have been red, because if it were, the banana would have to be yellow, which contradicts the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
