            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Tom did not watch football', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Jen might not have watched basketball' provides us with the possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, but it does not confirm it. The second statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball' is a conditional statement that implies if Tom watched football, then Jen definitely watched basketball. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Tom did not watch football.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that it's possible Jen did not watch basketball. If Tom watched football, then according to the second statement, Jen must have watched basketball. But since we know it's possible Jen did not watch basketball, we can infer that Tom cannot have watched football, because if he did, Jen would have definitely watched basketball, which contradicts the possibility that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
