            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book was not written by James', let's analyze the given statements. The first statement 'The book might not be a mystery novel' implies that it's possible the book is not a mystery novel, but it doesn't confirm it. The second statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel' sets a condition that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel. \n\nHowever, the first statement doesn't confirm that the book is not a mystery novel; it only suggests the possibility. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the book was not written by James, as it's still possible that the book is a mystery novel and was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
