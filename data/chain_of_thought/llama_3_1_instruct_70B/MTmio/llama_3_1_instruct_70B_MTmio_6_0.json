            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue did not choose pizza', let's analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Bob might not have chosen pasta' implies that it's possible Bob chose something other than pasta, but it doesn't provide any information about Sue's choice. The second statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta' is a conditional statement that links Sue's choice of pizza to Bob's choice of pasta. \n\nIf we assume Sue chose pizza, then according to the second statement, Bob must have chosen pasta. However, this contradicts the first statement, which says Bob might not have chosen pasta. Since we can't have both statements true at the same time if Sue chose pizza, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
