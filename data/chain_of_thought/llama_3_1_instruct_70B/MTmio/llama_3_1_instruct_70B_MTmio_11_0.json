            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The cake was not chocolate', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'The muffins might not have been blueberry' implies that it's possible the muffins were not blueberry, but it doesn't provide any information about the cake. The second statement 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry' is a conditional statement that links the cake being chocolate to the muffins being blueberry. \n\nIf the muffins might not have been blueberry, it means there's a possibility they were not blueberry. According to the second statement, if the cake was chocolate, the muffins must have been blueberry. However, since we know the muffins might not have been blueberry, it's possible that the condition for the cake being chocolate (i.e., the muffins being blueberry) is not met. \n\nThis suggests that if the cake was indeed chocolate, it would contradict the possibility of the muffins not being blueberry. Therefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate, as it would be inconsistent with the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
