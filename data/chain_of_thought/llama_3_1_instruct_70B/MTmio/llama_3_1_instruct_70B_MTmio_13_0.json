            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The car was not red', let's analyze the given statements. The first statement 'The truck might not have been blue' implies that it's possible the truck was not blue, but it doesn't provide any information about the car. The second statement 'If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue' is a conditional statement that links the color of the car to the color of the truck. \n\nIf the car was red, then the truck must have been blue, but we know from the first statement that the truck might not have been blue. This means that if the truck was indeed not blue, then the condition 'If the car was red' cannot be true, because it would lead to a contradiction (the truck must have been blue, but it wasn't). \n\nTherefore, if the truck might not have been blue, and the car being red would require the truck to be blue, then the car cannot be red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
