            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'The truck might not have been metal' implies that there is a possibility the truck was not metal, but it does not provide any information about the doll. The second statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal' is a conditional statement that links the doll's material to the truck's material. \n\nIf the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. However, we know from the first statement that the truck might not have been metal. This means that if the truck was not metal, then the condition 'the doll was plastic' cannot be true, because if it were true, the truck would have to be metal. \n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the truck was not metal, then the doll cannot be plastic. Since we know the truck might not have been metal, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
