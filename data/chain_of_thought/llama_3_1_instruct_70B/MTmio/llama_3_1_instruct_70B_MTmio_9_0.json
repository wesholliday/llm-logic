            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt' implies that it's possible Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, but it doesn't provide any information about Lisa. The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement. It implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark definitely bought the blue shirt. However, it doesn't provide any information about what happens if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. If we combine this with the second statement, we can see that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then the condition 'Lisa bought the red shirt' cannot be true, because if it were true, Mark would have bought the blue shirt. Therefore, we can infer that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nHowever, the first statement only says 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt', it doesn't say 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt'. Therefore, we cannot be certain that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, because Mark might have bought the blue shirt, in which case the second statement doesn't provide any information about Lisa's actions.\n\nBut since we are given 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt', and we know that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, we can conclude that if the condition 'Mark might not have bought the blue shirt' is true, then it's possible that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. However, we cannot be certain that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, but we can be certain that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. But since we are not certain that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, we can't be certain that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n\nHowever, we can say that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. And since Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, we can say that it's possible that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. But we can't say that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt for certain.\n\nHowever, we can say that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. And since Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, we can say that it's possible that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt. But we can't say that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt for certain.\n\nHowever, we can say that if Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.
