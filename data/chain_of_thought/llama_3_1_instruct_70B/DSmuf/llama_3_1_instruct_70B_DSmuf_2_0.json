            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into logical expressions. Let's denote 'The book must be resting on the table' as 'p' and 'The book is on the shelf' as 'q'. The first statement 'Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf' can be expressed as 'p \u2228 q' (p or q). The second statement 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' can be expressed as '\u00acp' (not p).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that either p or q is true. The second statement tells us that p is not true. Since p is not true, the only way for 'p \u2228 q' to be true is if q is true. This is because in a logical 'or' statement, if one of the conditions is false, the other condition must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
