The first statement is 'A or B', where A is 'the remote control must be hiding under the couch' and B is 'the remote control is on the coffee table'. The second statement is 'not A'. \n\nIn a logical 'or' statement, if one of the options is false, the other option must be true for the entire statement to be true. Since we know 'not A', we can conclude that A is false. Therefore, for the first statement 'A or B' to be true, B must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
