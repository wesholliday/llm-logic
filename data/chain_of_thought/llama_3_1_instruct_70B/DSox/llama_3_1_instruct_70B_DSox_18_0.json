The first statement is 'The shank is not nugged', which directly negates the possibility of the shank being nugged. The second statement is 'Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged', which presents two alternatives: the shank is either plooked or nugged.\n\nGiven that we know the shank is not nugged (from the first statement), we can eliminate the 'nugged' option from the second statement. This leaves us with only one possibility: the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
