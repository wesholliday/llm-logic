The first statement is 'The flug is not zimmed', which tells us that the flug is definitely not zimmed. The second statement is 'Either the flug is blummed or it is zimmed', which presents two possibilities: the flug is either blummed or zimmed. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that the flug is not zimmed, we can eliminate the possibility of the flug being zimmed. This leaves us with only one possibility from the second statement: the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
