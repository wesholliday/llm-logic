The first statement is 'The whiffle is not tinked', which directly negates the possibility of the whiffle being tinked. The second statement is 'Either the whiffle is shanked or it is tinked', which presents two possible states for the whiffle: being shanked or being tinked.\n\nGiven that we know the whiffle is not tinked from the first statement, we can eliminate the possibility of it being tinked. This leaves us with only one option from the second statement: the whiffle being shanked. Since the second statement presents an 'either-or' situation and we have eliminated one option, we can logically conclude that the whiffle must be shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
