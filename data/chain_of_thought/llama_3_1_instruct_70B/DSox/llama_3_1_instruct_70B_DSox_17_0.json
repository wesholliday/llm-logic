The second statement is 'Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated'. This is a classic example of a disjunctive syllogism, where we have two alternatives (the flob is skizzled or it is movated) and we know that one of them is not true (the flob is not movated). \n\nBy applying the disjunctive syllogism rule, if one of the alternatives is false, then the other alternative must be true. In this case, since we know the flob is not movated, we can conclude that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
