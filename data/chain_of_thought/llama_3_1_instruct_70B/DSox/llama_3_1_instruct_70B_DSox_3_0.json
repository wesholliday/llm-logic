The first statement is 'The splat is not quanked', which directly negates the possibility of the splat being quanked. The second statement is 'Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked', which presents two possibilities: the splat is either morphed or quanked. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that the splat is not quanked, we can eliminate the 'quanked' option from the second statement. This leaves us with only one possibility: the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
