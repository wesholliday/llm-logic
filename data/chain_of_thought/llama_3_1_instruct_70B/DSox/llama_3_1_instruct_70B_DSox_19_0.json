The second statement is 'Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged'. This is a classic example of a logical disjunction, where 'or' is used in an exclusive sense, meaning that if one option is true, the other must be false.\n\nGiven that 'The smonk is not plagged', we can eliminate the second option in the disjunction ('it is plagged'). Since the disjunction states that it is either vreebled or plagged, and we know it's not plagged, the only remaining option is that 'The smonk is vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
