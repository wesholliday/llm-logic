This statement directly negates the possibility of the twonk being plinked. The second statement is 'Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked'. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that the twonk is not plinked, we can eliminate the 'plinked' option from the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining option: 'The twonk is varnished'. \n\nAnswer: yes",
