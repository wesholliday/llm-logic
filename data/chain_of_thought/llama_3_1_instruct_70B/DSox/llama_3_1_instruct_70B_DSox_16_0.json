The first statement is 'The sneg is not sproted', which tells us that the sneg is definitely not sproted. The second statement is 'Either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted', which presents two possibilities: the sneg is either crampled or sproted. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that the sneg is not sproted, we can eliminate the 'sproted' option from the second statement. This leaves us with only one possibility: the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
