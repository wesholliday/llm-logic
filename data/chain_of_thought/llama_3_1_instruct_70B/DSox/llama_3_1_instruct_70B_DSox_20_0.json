The second statement is 'Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned'. This is a classic example of a logical disjunction, where 'or' is used in an exclusive sense. \n\nGiven that 'The fleeg is not surned', we can eliminate the second option in the disjunction ('it is surned'). Since the disjunction states that it is either bluttered or surned, and we know it is not surned, we can conclude that the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
