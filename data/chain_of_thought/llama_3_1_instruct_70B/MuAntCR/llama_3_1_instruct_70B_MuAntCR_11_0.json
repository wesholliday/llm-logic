The original statement only mentions that the software must have been restarted, but it does not provide any information about whether the software was updated or not. Restarting software can be done for various reasons, such as resolving issues, applying updates, or simply to refresh the system. Since the original statement does not explicitly mention an update, we cannot assume that an update occurred.\n\nAnswer: no",
