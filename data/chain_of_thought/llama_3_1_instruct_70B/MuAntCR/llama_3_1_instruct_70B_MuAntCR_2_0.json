The original statement only provides information about the book's cover color, which is red. It does not provide any information about the book's location, such as being on a shelf. \n\nSince the original statement does not mention the book's location, we cannot infer that the book was on the shelf. The information about the book's cover color is present in both statements, but the additional information about the book's location in the second statement is not supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
