The original statement only mentions the frequency of taking the medicine (twice daily) but does not provide any information about whether it should be taken with food or not. \n\nSince there is no information about taking the medicine with food in the original statement, we cannot infer that it must be taken with food. The original statement only provides information about the frequency of taking the medicine, not the conditions under which it should be taken.\n\nAnswer: no",
