The original statement only mentions that the exam covered all chapters, but it does not provide any information about the difficulty level of the exam. The inferred statement adds an additional attribute (difficulty) that is not present in the original statement. Since we cannot deduce the difficulty level of the exam from the original statement, we cannot infer the additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
