It does not provide any information about the report's accuracy. The phrase 'must have been' is used to express obligation or necessity, but in this context, it only applies to the submission time, not the report's content or accuracy. Therefore, we cannot infer that the report must have been accurate based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
