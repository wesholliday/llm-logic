            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been signed and notarized' from 'The document must have been notarized', we need to consider the relationship between notarization and signing. Notarization is a process that typically involves verifying the identity of the signer and witnessing their signature on a document. In most cases, notarization implies that the document has been signed, as the notary public is verifying the signature. However, the statement 'The document must have been notarized' does not explicitly mention signing, but it is a necessary step in the notarization process.\n\nAnswer: yes",
