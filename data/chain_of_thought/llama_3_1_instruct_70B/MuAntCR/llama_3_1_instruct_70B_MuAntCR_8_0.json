The original statement only provides information about the type of cuisine served at the restaurant, which is Italian. However, it does not provide any information about the restaurant's operating hours or whether it was closed on Monday. \n\nSince there is no information about the restaurant's operating hours, we cannot infer that the restaurant was closed on Monday. The original statement only confirms the type of cuisine served, but it does not provide any additional information about the restaurant's hours of operation.\n\nAnswer: no",
