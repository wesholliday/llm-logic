            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM' from 'The concert must have started at 8 PM', we need to analyze the given statement. The original statement only provides information about the start time of the concert, which is 8 PM. It does not provide any information about the concert's ticket sales or whether it was sold out. \n\nInference requires drawing a conclusion based on the given information. Since the original statement does not mention anything about the concert being sold out, we cannot logically infer that the concert was sold out. The information about the concert starting at 8 PM is present, but the information about it being sold out is not.\n\nAnswer: no",
