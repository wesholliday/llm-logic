The first statement 'Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. The second statement 'The glip is not tragged' is a negation of one of the options in the disjunction. \n\nGiven that the glip is not tragged, we can eliminate the second option in the disjunction. Since the disjunction states that at least one of the options must be true, and the second option is eliminated, the first option 'The glip is slogged' must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
