            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket is cranked', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled' is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement 'The sprocket is not daggled' is a negation of one of the conditions in the disjunction.\n\nBy combining these two statements, we can use a process called disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have a disjunction (A or B) and we know that one of the conditions (B) is false, then we can conclude that the other condition (A) must be true.\n\nIn this case, we have 'Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled' (A or B) and 'The sprocket is not daggled' (not B). Using disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude that 'The sprocket is cranked' (A) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
