            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Jen watched basketball', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Tom watched football' is a simple assertion. The second statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B', where A is 'Tom watched football' and B is 'Jen watched basketball'. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is true, then the conclusion (B) must also be true. In this case, we know that Tom watched football (A is true), so according to the conditional statement, we can conclude that Jen watched basketball (B is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
