            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was metal', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement, 'The doll was plastic', provides information about the doll. The second statement, 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', is a conditional statement that links the doll's material to the truck's material. \n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition (the doll was plastic) is true, then the conclusion (the truck was metal) must also be true. Since we know the doll was plastic from the first statement, we can apply this information to the conditional statement. \n\nGiven that the condition is met (the doll was plastic), we can logically conclude that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
