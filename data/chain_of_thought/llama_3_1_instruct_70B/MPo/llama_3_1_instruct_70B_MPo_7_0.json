            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Chris finished the race', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Alex finished the race' is a simple assertion. The second statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then C' where A is 'Alex finished the race' and C is 'Chris finished the race'. \n\nIn logic, this type of argument is known as modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have 'If A, then C' and we also have A, then we can conclude C. In this case, we have 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' and we also have 'Alex finished the race'. \n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
