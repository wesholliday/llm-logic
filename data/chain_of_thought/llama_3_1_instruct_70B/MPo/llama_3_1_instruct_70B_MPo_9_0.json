            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Mark bought the blue shirt', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is a simple assertion. The second statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B' where A is 'Lisa bought the red shirt' and B is 'Mark bought the blue shirt'. \n\nIn logic, this type of argument is known as modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we also know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is true. In this case, we know that Lisa bought the red shirt (A is true), and we have the conditional statement 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. \n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
