            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The banana was yellow', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement is 'The apple was red', which provides a fact about the apple. The second statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', which is a conditional statement that links the color of the apple to the color of the banana. \n\nIn this case, the condition 'If the apple was red' is met by the first statement. According to the rules of conditional statements, if the condition is true and the statement is of the form 'If A, then B', we can infer B. Therefore, since the condition 'The apple was red' is true, we can infer the conclusion 'The banana was yellow'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
