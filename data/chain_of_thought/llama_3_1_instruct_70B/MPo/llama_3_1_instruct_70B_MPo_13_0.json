            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The truck was blue', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement is 'The car was red', which provides a fact about the car's color. The second statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', which is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the car's color and the truck's color. \n\nIn this case, the condition 'If the car was red' is met, as stated in the first statement. According to the conditional statement, if the condition is true, then the consequence 'the truck was blue' must also be true. This type of logical reasoning is known as modus ponens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
