            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'Sue was at the wedding', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Mary was at the wedding' provides us with a fact about Mary's presence at the wedding. The second statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding' is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence at the wedding. \n\nIn logic, this type of argument is known as modus ponens. Modus ponens is a valid argument form that states: if P, then Q; P; therefore, Q. In this case, P is 'Mary was at the wedding', and Q is 'Sue was at the wedding'. Since we have both the condition (P) and the conditional statement (if P, then Q), we can logically conclude Q.\n\nAnswer: yes",
