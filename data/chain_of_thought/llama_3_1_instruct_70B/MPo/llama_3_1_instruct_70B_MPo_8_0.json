            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The mummy was awake', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is 'The vampire was awake', which provides us with a fact. The second statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', which is a conditional statement. This type of statement implies that if the condition (the vampire being awake) is true, then the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\nGiven that we know the vampire was awake, we can use this information to satisfy the condition in the conditional statement. Since the condition is met, we can logically conclude that the consequence (the mummy being awake) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
