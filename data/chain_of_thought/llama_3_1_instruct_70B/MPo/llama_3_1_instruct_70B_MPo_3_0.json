            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The book is a mystery novel', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'The book was written by James' provides information about the author of the book. The second statement 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel' is a conditional statement that establishes a relationship between the author and the genre of the book. \n\nIn this case, the condition 'the book was written by James' is met by the first statement. According to the rules of logical inference, if the condition of a conditional statement is true, and the statement itself is also true, then we can infer the conclusion of the conditional statement. \n\nTherefore, since we know the book was written by James, and we know that if the book was written by James then it is a mystery novel, we can logically conclude that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
