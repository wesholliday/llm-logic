            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is in the form of \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"). The conclusion is in the form of \"If not A, then not B\".\n\nThis type of argument is known as the \"inverse\" of the original statement. However, the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B is true, but it does not provide any information about what happens when A is false.\n\nIn other words, just because we know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt, it does not necessarily mean that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Mark could have bought the blue shirt regardless of whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
