            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', which can be represented as 'C \u2192 D' (where C represents 'the shirt was cotton' and D represents 'the pants were denim'). The conclusion is 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim', which can be represented as '\u00acC \u2192 \u00acD' (where \u00ac represents 'not').\n\nThe argument is attempting to establish a relationship between the negation of the premise's antecedent (\u00acC) and the negation of the premise's consequent (\u00acD). However, this is not a logically valid form of argument. The correct form of argument would be to conclude 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton' (\u00acD \u2192 \u00acC), which is the contrapositive of the original premise.\n\nThe given conclusion (\u00acC \u2192 \u00acD) is actually an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent, which is not a logically valid form of argument. This is because the negation of the antecedent does not necessarily imply the negation of the consequent.\n\nAnswer: no",
