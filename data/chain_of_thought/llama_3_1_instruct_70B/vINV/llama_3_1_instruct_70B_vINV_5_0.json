            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', which can be represented as 'B \u2192 T' (where 'B' represents 'Jeff played basketball' and 'T' represents 'Amy played tennis'). The conclusion is 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis', which can be represented as '\u00acB \u2192 \u00acT' (where '\u00ac' represents 'not').\n\nThe argument is trying to establish a relationship between the negation of the antecedent (Jeff not playing basketball) and the negation of the consequent (Amy not playing tennis). However, this is not a logically valid inference. The original premise only guarantees that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Jeff does not play basketball.\n\nIn fact, the conclusion is an example of the fallacy of denying the antecedent, which is a well-known logical fallacy. The correct conclusion from the premise 'B \u2192 T' would be '\u00acT \u2192 \u00acB' (if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball), not '\u00acB \u2192 \u00acT'.\n\nAnswer: no",
