            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', which can be represented as 'F \u2192 B' (where F represents 'Tom watched football' and B represents 'Jen watched basketball'). The conclusion is 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball', which can be represented as '\u00acF \u2192 \u00acB' (where \u00ac represents 'not').\n\nThe argument is attempting to derive the conclusion from the premise by negating both the antecedent (Tom watched football) and the consequent (Jen watched basketball). However, this is not a valid logical operation. The correct logical operation would be to negate the consequent and then negate the antecedent, which would result in '\u00acB \u2192 \u00acF', not '\u00acF \u2192 \u00acB'.\n\nThis type of error is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. The correct form of argument would be: 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball; Tom did not watch football; therefore, we cannot conclude anything about Jen watching basketball'. However, we can conclude that 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football' (\u00acB \u2192 \u00acF), which is the contrapositive of the original premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
