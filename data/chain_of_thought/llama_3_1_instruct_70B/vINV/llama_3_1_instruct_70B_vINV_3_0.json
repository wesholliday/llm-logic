            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel', which can be represented as 'If A, then B' (where A is 'the book was written by James' and B is 'the book is a mystery novel'). \n\nThe conclusion is 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel', which can be represented as 'If not A, then not B'. This is a classic example of the inverse form of the original statement. However, the inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nIn logic, the inverse of 'If A, then B' is 'If not A, then not B', but this is not a valid conclusion to draw from the original statement. The original statement only tells us that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel, but it does not provide any information about what happens if the book was not written by James. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel' is not logically supported by the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
