            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', which can be represented as 'V \u2192 M' (where 'V' represents 'the vampire was awake' and 'M' represents 'the mummy was awake'). The conclusion is 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake', which can be represented as '\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM' (where '\u00ac' represents 'not').\n\nThe argument is trying to establish a relationship between the negation of the premise's antecedent (\u00acV) and the negation of the premise's consequent (\u00acM). However, this is not a logically valid form of argument. The correct form of argument would be to conclude 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake' (M \u2192 V), which is the contrapositive of the original premise.\n\nThe given conclusion (\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM) is actually the inverse of the contrapositive, and it does not logically follow from the premise. The inverse of the contrapositive is not a logically valid conclusion, as it is possible for the vampire to be awake while the mummy is not, and it is also possible for the vampire to be not awake while the mummy is awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
