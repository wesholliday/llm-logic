            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', which can be represented as 'P \u2192 M' (where 'P' represents 'the doll was plastic' and 'M' represents 'the truck was metal'). The conclusion is 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal', which can be represented as '\u00acP \u2192 \u00acM' (where '\u00ac' represents 'not').\n\nThe argument is attempting to apply a logical rule called 'contrapositive'. The contrapositive of a statement 'P \u2192 M' is '\u00acM \u2192 \u00acP'. However, the conclusion '\u00acP \u2192 \u00acM' is not the contrapositive of the premise 'P \u2192 M'. Instead, it is the converse of the contrapositive.\n\nA logically valid argument would be: 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' (P \u2192 M) \u2192 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic' (\u00acM \u2192 \u00acP). The given conclusion 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal' (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acM) does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
