            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\"). The conclusion is also a conditional statement, but it is the contrapositive of the premise's negation, which is \"If not A, then not B\".\n\nHowever, the conclusion is not the contrapositive of the premise itself. The contrapositive of the premise would be \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\". The conclusion is actually the inverse of the premise, which is not logically equivalent to the premise.\n\nIn general, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The inverse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not A, then not B\", but this does not follow logically from the original statement. The original statement only tells us what happens when A is true, but it does not provide any information about what happens when A is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
