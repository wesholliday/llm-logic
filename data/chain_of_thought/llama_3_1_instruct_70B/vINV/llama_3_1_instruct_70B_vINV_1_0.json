            "content": "Explanation: To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The premise is 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', which can be represented as 'M \u2192 S' (where 'M' represents 'Mary was at the wedding' and 'S' represents 'Sue was at the wedding'). The conclusion is 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding', which can be represented as '\u00acM \u2192 \u00acS' (where '\u00ac' represents 'not').\n\nThe conclusion '\u00acM \u2192 \u00acS' is the contrapositive of the premise 'M \u2192 S'. However, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. But the conclusion '\u00acM \u2192 \u00acS' is not the contrapositive of the premise 'M \u2192 S'. The contrapositive of 'M \u2192 S' would be '\u00acS \u2192 \u00acM'. \n\nThe conclusion '\u00acM \u2192 \u00acS' is actually the inverse of the premise 'M \u2192 S'. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
