            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The grommet is sploffed', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possible states for the grommet. The second statement 'The grommet is not plopped' negates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement.\n\nGiven that the grommet can only be in one of the two states (plopped or sploffed) according to the first statement, and the second statement eliminates the possibility of it being plopped, we can logically conclude that the grommet must be in the other state, which is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
