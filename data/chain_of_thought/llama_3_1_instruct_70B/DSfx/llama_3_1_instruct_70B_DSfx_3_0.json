            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat is morphed', we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement 'Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possible states for the splat. The second statement 'The splat is not quanked' negates one of the possibilities presented in the first statement. \n\nGiven that the first statement presents two options and the second statement eliminates one of those options, we can use the process of elimination to infer the remaining option. Since 'The splat is not quanked', the only remaining possibility from the first statement is 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
