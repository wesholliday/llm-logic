The first statement is 'The flob is not movated', which directly negates the possibility of the flob being movated. The second statement is 'Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled', which presents two possibilities: the flob is either movated or skizzled. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that the flob is not movated, we can eliminate the first possibility presented in the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility: the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
