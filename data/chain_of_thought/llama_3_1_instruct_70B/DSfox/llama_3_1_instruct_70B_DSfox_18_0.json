The first statement is 'The shank is not nugged', which directly negates the possibility of the shank being nugged. The second statement is 'Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked', which presents two possibilities: the shank is either nugged or plooked. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that the shank is not nugged, we can eliminate the first possibility presented in the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility: the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
