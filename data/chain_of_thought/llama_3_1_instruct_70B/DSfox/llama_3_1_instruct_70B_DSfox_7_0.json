The first statement is 'The whiffle is not tinked', which directly negates the possibility of the whiffle being tinked. The second statement is 'Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked', which presents two possible states for the whiffle: being tinked or being shanked.\n\nGiven that we know the whiffle is not tinked from the first statement, we can eliminate the possibility of it being tinked. This leaves us with the only remaining option from the second statement, which is that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
