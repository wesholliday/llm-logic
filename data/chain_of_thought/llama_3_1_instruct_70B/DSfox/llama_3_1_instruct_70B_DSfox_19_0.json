The second statement is 'Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled'. This is a classic example of a logical disjunction, where 'or' is used in an exclusive sense. \n\nGiven that the smonk is not plagged, we can eliminate the first option in the disjunction. Since the disjunction states that it is either plagged or vreebled, and we know it is not plagged, the only remaining option is that it is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
