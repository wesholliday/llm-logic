The first statement is 'The splat is not quanked', which directly negates the possibility of the splat being quanked. The second statement is 'Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed', which presents two possibilities: the splat is quanked or the splat is morphed.\n\nGiven that we know the splat is not quanked from the first statement, we can eliminate the first possibility in the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility: the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
