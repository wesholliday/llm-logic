The first statement is 'The wug is not garpled', which tells us that the wug does not have the property of being garpled. The second statement is 'Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged', which presents two possibilities for the wug: it is either garpled or sproinged.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the wug is not garpled, we can eliminate the first option in the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility: the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
