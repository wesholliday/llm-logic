This tells us that the smip is definitely not lupped. The second statement is 'Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped'. This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two options must be true. Since we know from the first statement that the smip is not lupped, the only remaining option is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
