The first statement is 'The fleeg is not surned', which directly negates the possibility of the fleeg being surned. The second statement is 'Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered', which presents two possibilities: the fleeg is surned or the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the fleeg is not surned, we can eliminate the first possibility presented in the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility: the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
