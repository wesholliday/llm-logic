The first statement is 'The dreb is not spened', which tells us that the dreb is in a state of not being spened. The second statement is 'Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed', which presents two possibilities for the state of the dreb: it is either spened or vroombed.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the dreb is not spened, we can eliminate the first possibility presented in the second statement. This leaves us with the second possibility: the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
