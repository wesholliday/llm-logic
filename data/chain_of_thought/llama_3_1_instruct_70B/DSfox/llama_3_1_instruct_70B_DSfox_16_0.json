The first statement is 'The sneg is not sproted', which directly negates the possibility of the sneg being sproted. The second statement is 'Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled', which presents two possible states for the sneg: being sproted or being crampled.\n\nGiven that we know the sneg is not sproted from the first statement, we can eliminate the possibility of the sneg being sproted. This leaves us with the only remaining option from the second statement, which is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
