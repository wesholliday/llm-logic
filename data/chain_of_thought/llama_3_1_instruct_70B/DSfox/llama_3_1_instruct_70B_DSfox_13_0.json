The first statement is 'The glip is not tragged', which tells us that the glip does not have the property of being tragged. The second statement is 'Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged', which presents two possibilities for the glip: it is either tragged or slogged.\n\nGiven that we know the glip is not tragged from the first statement, we can eliminate the first option in the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility: the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
