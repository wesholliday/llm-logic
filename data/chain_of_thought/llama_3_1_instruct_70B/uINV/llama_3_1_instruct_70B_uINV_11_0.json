This type of statement does not provide any information about the situation when A is not true. In other words, it does not imply that if A is not true, then B is not true. This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. \n\nIn this case, we can only conclude that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. However, we cannot make any conclusions about the muffins if the cake was not chocolate. The muffins could still be blueberry, or they could be something else entirely.\n\nAnswer: no",
