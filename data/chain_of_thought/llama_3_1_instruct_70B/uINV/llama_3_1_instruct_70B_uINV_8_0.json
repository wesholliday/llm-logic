This statement does not provide any information about the situation when the vampire is not awake. It only guarantees that if the vampire is awake, the mummy is also awake. However, it does not rule out the possibility that the mummy could be awake even if the vampire is not awake. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
