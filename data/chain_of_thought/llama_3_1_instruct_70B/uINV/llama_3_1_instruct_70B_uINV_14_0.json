This type of statement does not provide any information about the converse, i.e., \"If not A, then not B\". In other words, just because we know that if the bear was in the cave, the wolf was in the den, it does not necessarily mean that if the bear was not in the cave, the wolf was not in the den. There could be other scenarios where the bear is not in the cave, but the wolf is still in the den.\n\nAnswer: no",
