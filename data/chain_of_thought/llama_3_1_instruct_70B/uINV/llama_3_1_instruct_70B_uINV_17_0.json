It only tells us what happens if Ben eats pasta. \n\nIn logic, this type of statement is often represented as A \u2192 B (A implies B). However, it does not imply the converse, which would be \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB (not A implies not B). In other words, just because A implies B, it does not mean that not A implies not B.\n\nIn this case, we cannot infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. There is no information provided about what Kate eats if Ben does not eat pasta. Kate could still eat salad even if Ben does not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
