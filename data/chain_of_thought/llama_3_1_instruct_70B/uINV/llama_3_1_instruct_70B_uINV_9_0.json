            "content": "Explanation: This is a classic example of a logical argument, specifically a conditional statement. The original statement is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be represented as \"If A, then B\" (A = Lisa bought the red shirt, B = Mark bought the blue shirt). \n\nThe question is asking if we can infer the contrapositive of the original statement, which is \"If not A, then not B\" (If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt). \n\nHowever, the contrapositive is not necessarily true based on the original statement alone. The original statement only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Lisa does not buy the red shirt. Mark might still buy the blue shirt even if Lisa does not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
