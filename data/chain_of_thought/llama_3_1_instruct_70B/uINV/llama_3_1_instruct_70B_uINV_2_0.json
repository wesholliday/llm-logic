This type of statement does not provide any information about the converse or the inverse. The converse would be \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest,\" and the inverse would be \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\" \n\nIn this case, we are trying to infer the inverse. However, the original statement does not provide any information about what happens when the griffin is not in the forest. It only tells us what happens when the griffin is in the forest. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
