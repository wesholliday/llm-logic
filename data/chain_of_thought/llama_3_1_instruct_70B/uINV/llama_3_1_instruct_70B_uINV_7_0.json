            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\" (A \u2192 B). To determine if we can infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race, we need to examine the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not A, then not B\" (\u00acA \u2192 \u00acB). However, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, just because A \u2192 B is true, it does not necessarily mean that \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB is true. \n\nIn this case, we can think of a counterexample where Alex does not finish the race, but Chris still finishes the race. For instance, Alex might have gotten injured, while Chris had a great run and finished the race. This counterexample shows that the inverse statement is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
