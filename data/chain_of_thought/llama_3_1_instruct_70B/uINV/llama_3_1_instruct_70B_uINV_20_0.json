            "content": "Explanation: This question involves a logical argument and requires an understanding of conditional statements. The given statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a classic example of a conditional statement, where the truth of the conclusion (the banana was yellow) depends on the truth of the premise (the apple was red).\n\nHowever, the question asks us to infer the opposite: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" This is known as the inverse of the original statement. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true. The original statement only guarantees that if the apple is red, the banana is yellow, but it does not provide any information about what happens if the apple is not red.\n\nIn other words, the original statement does not rule out the possibility that the banana could still be yellow even if the apple is not red. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: no",
