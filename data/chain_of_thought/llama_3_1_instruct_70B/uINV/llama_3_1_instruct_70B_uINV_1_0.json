            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding\"). This type of statement does not provide any information about the converse, i.e., \"If not A, then not B\". The converse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, just because we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. Sue's presence at the wedding may or may not be dependent on Mary's presence.\n\nAnswer: no",
