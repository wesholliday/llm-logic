This type of statement does not provide any information about the converse or the inverse. The converse would be \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football,\" and the inverse would be \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" \n\nIn this case, we are trying to infer the inverse. However, the original statement does not provide enough information to conclude the inverse. The original statement only tells us that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, but it does not tell us what happens if Tom did not watch football. Jen might still watch basketball even if Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: no",
