            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake'. This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement implies that the vampire and the mummy cannot be awake at the same time. However, it does not explicitly state that if the mummy is awake, the vampire must be asleep. The original statement only provides information about the vampire's state being awake and its effect on the mummy's state.\n\nTo make the inference 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake', we would need additional information or a statement that explicitly states the converse of the original statement. However, based on the given information alone, we can make a logical inference using the concept of contrapositive.\n\nThe contrapositive of the original statement 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake' is 'If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake'. This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. In this case, the contrapositive is 'If the mummy was awake (not not B), then the vampire was not awake (not A)'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
