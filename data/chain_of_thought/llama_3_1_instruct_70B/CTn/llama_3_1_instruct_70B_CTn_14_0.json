            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave', we need to check if this new statement is logically equivalent to the original statement or if it can be derived from it.\n\nThe new statement 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' is of the form 'If B, then not A'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we have 'If A, then not B', and its contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A', which is exactly the new statement.\n\nSince the new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
