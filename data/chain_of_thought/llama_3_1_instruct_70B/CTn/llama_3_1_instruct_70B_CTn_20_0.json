            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement implies that if the apple is red, the banana cannot be yellow. However, it does not provide information about the color of the apple when the banana is yellow. The new statement 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' is in the form of 'If B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer the new statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
