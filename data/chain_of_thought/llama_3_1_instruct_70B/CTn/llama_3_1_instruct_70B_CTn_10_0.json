The original statement is 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then not B'. \n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside', which is of the form 'If B, then not A'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
