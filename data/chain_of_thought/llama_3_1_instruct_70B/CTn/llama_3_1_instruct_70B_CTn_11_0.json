To determine if we can infer 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate' is in the form of 'If B, then not A'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can infer the contrapositive statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
