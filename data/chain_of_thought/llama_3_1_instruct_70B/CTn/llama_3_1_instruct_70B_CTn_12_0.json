            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo. However, it does not provide information about what happens if Joe did not go to the park. It only tells us about the consequence of Joe going to the park.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If B, then not A'. This statement is actually the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we have 'If A, then not B', so the contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A'.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
