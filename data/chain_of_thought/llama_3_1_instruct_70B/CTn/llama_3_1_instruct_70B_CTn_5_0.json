            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' is of the form 'If B, then not A'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we are dealing with 'If A, then not B' and its contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A', which is exactly what we are trying to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
