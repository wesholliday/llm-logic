            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball'. This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement implies that if Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball. However, it does not provide information about what happens if Tom did not watch football. It only tells us what happens if Tom did watch football.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football'. This is a conditional statement in the form 'If B, then not A'. This statement is actually the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we have 'If A, then not B', so the contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A'.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
