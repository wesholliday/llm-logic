            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta'. This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza' is in the form 'If B, then not A'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we have 'If A, then not B', and its contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A'.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
