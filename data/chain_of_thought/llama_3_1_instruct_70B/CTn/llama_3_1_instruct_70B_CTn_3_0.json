            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can make this inference, we need to analyze the original statement and the proposed conclusion. The original statement is 'If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then not B', where A is 'the book was written by James' and B is 'the book is a mystery novel'.\n\nThe proposed conclusion is 'If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'. This is also a conditional statement, but of the form 'If B, then not A'. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can indeed infer the proposed conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
