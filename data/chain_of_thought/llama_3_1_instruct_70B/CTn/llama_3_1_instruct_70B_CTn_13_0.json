            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was not blue'. This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement implies that if the car is red, the truck cannot be blue. However, it does not provide information about the color of the car if the truck is blue. The converse of the original statement would be 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was red', which is not the same as the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nHowever, we can use the contrapositive form of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If A, then not B' is 'If B, then not A'. Applying this to the original statement, we get 'If the truck was blue, then the car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
