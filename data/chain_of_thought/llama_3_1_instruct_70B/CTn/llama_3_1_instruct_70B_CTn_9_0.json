To determine if we can infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' is of the form 'If B, then not A'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can indeed infer the contrapositive statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
