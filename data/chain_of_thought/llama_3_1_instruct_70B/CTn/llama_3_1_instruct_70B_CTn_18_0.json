            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement implies that if the doll is plastic, the truck cannot be metal. However, it does not provide information about the doll's material if the truck is metal. The converse of the original statement would be 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was plastic', which is not the same as the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nHowever, we can use the contrapositive of the original statement, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of 'If A, then not B' is 'If B, then not A'. Applying this to the original statement, we get 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
