            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe statement 'If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest' is of the form 'If B, then not A'. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statement, we can indeed infer the contrapositive statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
