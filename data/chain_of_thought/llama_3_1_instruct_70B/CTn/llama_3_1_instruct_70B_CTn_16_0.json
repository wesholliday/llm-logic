            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If A, then not B'. To determine if we can infer 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement implies that if the shirt is cotton, the pants cannot be denim. However, it does not provide information about what happens if the pants are denim. It only tells us what happens if the shirt is cotton.\n\nThe statement we are trying to infer is 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton'. This is a conditional statement in the form of 'If B, then not A'. This is actually the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. However, in this case, we have 'If A, then not B', so the contrapositive would be 'If B, then not A'.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
