            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. The first statement is in the form of \"If A, then not B\" (If the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter). We are trying to infer a statement in the form of \"If B, then not A\" (If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars). \n\nThis type of inference is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". However, in this case, we are dealing with \"If A, then not B\" and trying to infer \"If B, then not A\". This is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement, as the contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is \"If B, then not A\". \n\nTherefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
