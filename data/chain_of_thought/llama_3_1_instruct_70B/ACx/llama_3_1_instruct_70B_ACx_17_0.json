If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated (If A, then B)\n2. The flob movated (B)\n\nWe are trying to determine if we can infer 'The flob was skizzled' (A) from these statements. \n\nIn logic, this type of argument is known as 'affirming the consequent'. The consequent is the second part of the conditional statement (B), and we are affirming it (stating it as true). However, affirming the consequent does not necessarily mean the antecedent (A) is true. There could be other reasons why the flob movated.\n\nFor example, consider the statement 'If it rains, then the grass gets wet'. If we know the grass is wet, we cannot conclude that it rained, because there could be other reasons why the grass is wet (e.g., someone watered it).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically infer that 'The flob was skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: no",
