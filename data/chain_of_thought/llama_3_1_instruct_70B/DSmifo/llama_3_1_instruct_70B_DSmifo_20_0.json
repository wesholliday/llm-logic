The first statement 'The sunglasses might not be perched on her head' indicates that it's possible the sunglasses are not on her head, but it doesn't confirm they are not on her head. The second statement 'Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag' presents two possible locations for the sunglasses, and it implies that these are the only two possibilities.\n\nHowever, the first statement does not confirm that the sunglasses are not on her head; it only suggests the possibility. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the sunglasses are in her bag based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
