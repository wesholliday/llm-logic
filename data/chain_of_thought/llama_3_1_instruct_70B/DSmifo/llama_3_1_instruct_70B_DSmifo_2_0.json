The first statement 'The book might not be resting on the table' implies that it is possible the book is not on the table, but it does not confirm that it is not on the table. The second statement 'Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf' presents two possibilities: the book is on the table or the book is on the shelf. \n\nHowever, the first statement does not confirm that the book is not on the table; it only suggests the possibility. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the book is on the shelf based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
