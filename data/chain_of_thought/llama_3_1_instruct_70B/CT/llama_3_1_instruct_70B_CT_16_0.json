            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the shirt was cotton' and B is 'the pants were denim'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton', we need to check if this is a valid logical conclusion. The statement 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton' is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
