            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Tom watched football' and B is 'Jen watched basketball'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement. The inferred statement is of the form 'If not B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', we can indeed infer 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
