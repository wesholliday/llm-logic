            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'. This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Jeff played basketball' and B is 'Amy played tennis'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball', we need to check if this is a valid logical conclusion. The statement 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' is the contrapositive of the original statement. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', we can indeed infer 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
