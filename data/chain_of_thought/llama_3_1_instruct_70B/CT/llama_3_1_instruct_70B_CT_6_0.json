This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Sue chose pizza' and B is 'Bob chose pasta'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement. The inferred statement is of the form 'If not B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta', we can indeed infer 'If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
