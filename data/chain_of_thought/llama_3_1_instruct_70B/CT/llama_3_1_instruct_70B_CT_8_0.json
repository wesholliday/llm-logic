This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the vampire was awake' and B is 'the mummy was awake'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference. The proposed inference is the contrapositive of the original statement, which is 'If not B, then not A'. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, we can indeed infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
