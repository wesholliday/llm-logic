            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument in the form of a conditional statement. The original statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. This is a classic example of a conditional statement, where 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is the antecedent (or condition) and 'Mark bought the blue shirt' is the consequent (or result).\n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference. The proposed inference is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if we know that 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is true, we can infer that 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
