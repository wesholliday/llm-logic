This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Sam took a plane' and B is 'Erin took a train'. To determine if we can infer 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement.\n\nThe inferred statement is in the form 'If not B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train', we can indeed infer 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
