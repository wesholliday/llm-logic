            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument known as the contrapositive. The original statement is 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue'. To determine if we can infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement is in the form 'If P, then Q', where P is 'the car was red' and Q is 'the truck was blue'. The contrapositive of this statement is 'If not Q, then not P', which translates to 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'. \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', we can indeed infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
