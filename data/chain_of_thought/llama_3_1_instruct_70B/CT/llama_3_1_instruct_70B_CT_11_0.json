            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument and the concept of contrapositive statements. The original statement is 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'. To determine if we can infer 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate', we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nIn this case, the original statement is 'If the cake was chocolate (A), then the muffins were blueberry (B)'. The contrapositive would be 'If the muffins were not blueberry (not B), then the cake was not chocolate (not A)'.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the contrapositive statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
