This is a conditional statement in the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Ben ate pasta' and B is 'Kate ate the salad'. To determine if we can infer 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement.\n\nThe inferred statement is in the form 'If not B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical equivalence of the original statement and its contrapositive, we can infer 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta' from the original statement 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
