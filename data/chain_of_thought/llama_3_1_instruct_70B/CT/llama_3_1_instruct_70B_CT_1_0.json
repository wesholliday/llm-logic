This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'Mary was at the wedding' and B is 'Sue was at the wedding'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the inferred statement. The inferred statement is of the form 'If not B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we can indeed infer 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
