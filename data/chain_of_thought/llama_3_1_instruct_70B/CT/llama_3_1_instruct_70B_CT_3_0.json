This type of statement does not provide any information about the converse (If B, then A) or the inverse (If not A, then not B). However, we can infer the contrapositive (If not B, then not A), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this case, the contrapositive of the given statement is 'If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James'. This is because if the book is not a mystery novel, it contradicts the original statement that if the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel. Therefore, we can logically infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
