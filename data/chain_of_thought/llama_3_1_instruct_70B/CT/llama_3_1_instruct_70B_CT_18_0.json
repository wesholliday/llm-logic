This is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B', where A is 'the doll was plastic' and B is 'the truck was metal'. \n\nTo determine if we can infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference. The proposed inference is of the form 'If not B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', we can indeed infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
