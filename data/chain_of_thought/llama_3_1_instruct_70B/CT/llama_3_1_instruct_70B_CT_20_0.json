            "content": "Explanation: This problem involves a logical argument known as the contrapositive. The original statement is in the form \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\"). The contrapositive of this statement is \"If not B, then not A\" (which is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\"). \n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true, and vice versa. Therefore, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
