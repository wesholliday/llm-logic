            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race' is a conditional statement of the form 'If A, then B'. To determine if we can infer 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race', we need to examine the relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference.\n\nThe proposed inference is of the form 'If not B, then not A', which is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement 'If A, then B' is 'If not B, then not A'. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical equivalence of the original statement and its contrapositive, we can infer 'If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
