This statement does not provide any information about the converse or the inverse. However, we can infer the contrapositive, which is 'If not B, then not A'. In this case, the contrapositive would be 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave'. This is because the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
