The statement 'The concert might be sold out or postponed' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possible scenarios: the concert being sold out or the concert being postponed. Since the statement explicitly mentions 'postponed' as one of the possibilities, we can logically conclude that the concert might indeed be postponed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
