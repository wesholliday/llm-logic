The use of 'or' in this context is inclusive, meaning that the package could be delivered on either day, or possibly both (although the latter is unlikely in this context). Since tomorrow is one of the two possible days mentioned, we can infer that there is a possibility of the package being delivered tomorrow.\n\nAnswer: yes",
