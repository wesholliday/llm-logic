            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The flight might be on time' from 'The flight might be delayed or on time', we need to analyze the given statement. The statement 'The flight might be delayed or on time' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possible outcomes: the flight being delayed or the flight being on time. Since 'might' is used, it indicates that both possibilities are uncertain. \n\nGiven that 'or' is inclusive in this context, it means that the flight could be either delayed, on time, or we just don't know yet. Therefore, we can infer that the flight might indeed be on time, as it is one of the possibilities presented in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
