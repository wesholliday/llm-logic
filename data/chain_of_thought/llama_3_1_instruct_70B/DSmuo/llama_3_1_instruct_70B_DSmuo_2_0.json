The first statement 'It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table' implies that it's not necessary for the book to be on the table. The second statement 'Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table' presents two possibilities: the book is on the shelf, or it must be on the table. \n\nSince we know from the first statement that it's not necessary for the book to be on the table, we can eliminate the second possibility in the second statement. This leaves us with the only remaining possibility: the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
