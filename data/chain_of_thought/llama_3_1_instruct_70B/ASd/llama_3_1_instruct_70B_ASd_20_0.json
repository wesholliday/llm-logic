However, it does not provide any information about the condition or quality of the medication. The statement 'If I take medication that expired, I will feel better' adds a new condition (the medication being expired) that is not present in the original statement. \n\nExpired medication may not be effective or could even be harmful, so we cannot assume that the original relationship between taking medication and feeling better still holds true. The original statement does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about the effectiveness of expired medication.\n\nAnswer: No",
