            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today' implies a direct relationship between the package shipping and its arrival. However, the addition of 'it was misrouted' introduces a new condition that could potentially affect the package's arrival. Misrouting could lead to delays or changes in the delivery schedule, which might contradict the original statement's implication that the package will arrive today. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original one, as the added condition could alter the outcome.\n\nAnswer: no",
