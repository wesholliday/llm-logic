            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired' implies a causal relationship between getting enough sleep and not being tired. However, it does not account for other factors that may contribute to tiredness, such as physical exertion or hard labor. Adding 'and do hard labor' to the original statement introduces a new variable that could potentially counteract the effect of getting enough sleep. In other words, even if you get enough sleep, doing hard labor may still cause you to be tired. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
