            "content": "Explanation: The original statement 'If I study hard, I will pass the test' implies a causal relationship between studying hard and passing the test. However, it does not provide any information about the language of the test. The addition of 'the test is in Chinese' introduces a new condition that is not present in the original statement. This new condition could potentially affect the outcome, as the ability to pass the test might depend on the test-taker's proficiency in Chinese, not just their studying. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
