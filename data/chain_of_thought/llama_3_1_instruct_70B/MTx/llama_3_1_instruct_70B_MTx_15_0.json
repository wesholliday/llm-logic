            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical argument form known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if we have two premises, 'If A, then B' and 'Not B', we can conclude 'Not A'. \n\nIn this case, we have the premises: \n1. If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened (If A, then B)\n2. The dreb was not spened (Not B)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can apply the rule of inference to conclude that 'Not A', which in this case is 'The dreb was not vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
