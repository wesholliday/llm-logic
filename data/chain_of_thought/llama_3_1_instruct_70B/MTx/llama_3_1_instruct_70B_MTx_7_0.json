Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if we have a conditional statement 'If A, then B' and we know that 'B' is false, then we can conclude that 'A' is also false.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked' (If A, then B) and we know that 'The whiffle did not tink' (B is false). Using modus tollens, we can conclude that 'The whiffle was not shanked' (A is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
