            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement is a conditional statement: 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'. This statement implies that if the condition 'the sneg was crampled' is true, then the consequence 'the sneg sproted the frink' must also be true. However, the second statement 'The sneg did not sproted the frink' tells us that the consequence is actually false.\n\nUsing the principle of modus tollens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and the consequence is false, then the condition must also be false, we can infer that 'the sneg was crampled' is false. This is because if 'the sneg was crampled' were true, then 'the sneg sproted the frink' would also be true, but we know that 'the sneg sproted the frink' is false.\n\nAnswer: yes",
