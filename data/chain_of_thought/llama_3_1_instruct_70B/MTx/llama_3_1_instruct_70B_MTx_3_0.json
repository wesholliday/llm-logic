            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The splat was not morphed', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'A \u2192 B', where A is 'the splat was morphed' and B is 'the splat quanked'. The second statement 'The splat did not quank' is the negation of B, which can be represented as '\u00acB'. \n\nUsing the rule of modus tollens in logic, which states that if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA, we can infer that if the splat did not quank, and the only condition for the splat to quank is that it was morphed, then the splat must not have been morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
