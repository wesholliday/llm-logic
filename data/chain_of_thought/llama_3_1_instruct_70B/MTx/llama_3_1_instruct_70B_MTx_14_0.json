            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical argument form known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if we have a conditional statement 'if A, then B' and we know that 'B' is false, then we can conclude that 'A' is also false.\n\nIn this case, we have the conditional statement 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged' (A = the clug was fleeked, B = the clug snugged). We also know that 'The clug did not snugged' (B is false). \n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that 'The clug was not fleeked' (A is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
