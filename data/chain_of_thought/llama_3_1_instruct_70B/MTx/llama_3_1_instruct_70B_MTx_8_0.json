            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The sprocket was not cranked', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B' or A \u2192 B, where A is 'the sprocket was cranked' and B is 'the sprocket was daggled'. The second statement 'The sprocket was not daggled' is the negation of B, which can be represented as \u00acB.\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, we can apply the modus tollens rule, which states that if A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA. In this case, if 'the sprocket was cranked' (A) implies 'the sprocket was daggled' (B), and we know that 'the sprocket was not daggled' (\u00acB), then we can logically conclude that 'the sprocket was not cranked' (\u00acA).\n\nAnswer: yes",
