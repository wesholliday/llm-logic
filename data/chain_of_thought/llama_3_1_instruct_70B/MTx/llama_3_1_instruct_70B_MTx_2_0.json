            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we can use a logical argument form known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a rule of inference that states: if we have two premises, 'If A, then B' and 'Not B', we can conclude 'Not A'. \n\nIn this case, we have the following premises:\n1. If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint (If A, then B)\n2. The wug did not bim the zoint (Not B)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that the wug was not flooped (Not A), since the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes",
