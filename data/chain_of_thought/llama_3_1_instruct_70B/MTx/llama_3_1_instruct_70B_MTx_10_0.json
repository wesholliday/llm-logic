            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The wug was not sproinged', we need to analyze the given statements using logical reasoning. The first statement 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled' is a conditional statement, which can be represented as 'If A, then B' (where A is 'the wug was sproinged' and B is 'it was garpled'). \n\nThe second statement 'The wug was not garpled' is the negation of B, which can be represented as 'not B'. \n\nIn logic, the rule of inference known as 'modus tollens' states that if we have 'If A, then B' and 'not B', we can infer 'not A'. Applying this rule to our statements, we can conclude that if 'the wug was sproinged' implies 'it was garpled', and we know 'it was not garpled', then we can infer 'the wug was not sproinged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
