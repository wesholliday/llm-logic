In a disjunction, if one of the options is true, the entire statement is true. However, we cannot directly infer 'The floob must be wobble' from the given statement because the statement allows for the possibility of 'The floob' being 'on wozzle' as well. \n\nTo infer 'The floob must be wobble', we would need additional information that eliminates the possibility of 'The floob' being 'on wozzle'. Without such information, we cannot conclude that 'The floob must be wobble' is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
