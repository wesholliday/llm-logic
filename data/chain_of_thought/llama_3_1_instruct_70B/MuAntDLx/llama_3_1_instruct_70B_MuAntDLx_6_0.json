Since 'wozzle frazzle' is one of the options, we can infer that 'The glorp' could indeed be 'wozzle frazzle'. However, we cannot be certain that it is 'wozzle frazzle' because 'blurble' is also a possibility. Nevertheless, the statement does imply that 'wozzle frazzle' is a possible state for 'The glorp'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
