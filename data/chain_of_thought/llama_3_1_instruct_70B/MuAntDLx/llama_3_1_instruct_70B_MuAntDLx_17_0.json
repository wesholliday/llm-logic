            "content": "Explanation: The given statement 'The frazzle must be frazzle or gribble' is a disjunction, meaning it presents two possible options for what the frazzle must be. In a disjunction, if one of the options is true, the entire statement is true. The statement does not rule out the possibility that the frazzle is indeed frazzle; in fact, it explicitly includes that option. Therefore, we can infer that the frazzle must be frazzle, as it is one of the possibilities presented in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
