In a disjunction, if either of the alternatives is true, the entire statement is true. However, we cannot infer that only one of the alternatives is true. The statement allows for the possibility that the flimble is crunk with plonk, but it also allows for the possibility that it is on an quank wobble. \n\nHowever, we can infer that if the flimble is not on an quank wobble, then it must be crunk with plonk. But from the given statement alone, we cannot infer that the flimble must be crunk with plonk, because the statement also allows for the possibility that it is on an quank wobble.\n\nAnswer: no",
