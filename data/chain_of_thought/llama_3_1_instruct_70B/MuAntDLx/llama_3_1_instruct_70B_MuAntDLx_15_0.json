In a disjunction, if one of the alternatives is true, the entire statement is true. However, we cannot infer that 'The blimp must be zooble frazzle wump' is true solely based on the given statement, because the statement also allows for the possibility that 'The blimp must be snork'. The only thing we can infer is that at least one of the alternatives must be true, but we cannot determine which one.\n\nAnswer: no",
