In a disjunction, if one of the alternatives is true, the entire statement is true. However, we cannot infer that 'The wump must be quank on zibber' is true solely based on the given statement, because the statement also allows for the possibility of 'wobble for quank quork'. The statement does not provide any information that would allow us to rule out 'wobble for quank quork' as a possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
