In a disjunction, if one option is true, the entire statement is true. However, we cannot infer that 'The floob must be in the glorp' is true solely based on the given statement, because the statement also allows for the possibility that the floob is on the wibble. The statement does not provide enough information to rule out the possibility of the floob being on the wibble, so we cannot conclude that it must be in the glorp.\n\nAnswer: no",
