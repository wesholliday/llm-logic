However, it does not provide any information about other possibilities, such as the quibble being plimp. The statement only mentions one possibility (blurble) and does not rule out or confirm any other possibilities. \n\nIn order to infer 'The quibble might be blurble or plimp', we would need additional information that suggests the quibble could also be plimp. Since the original statement does not provide this information, we cannot make this inference based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
