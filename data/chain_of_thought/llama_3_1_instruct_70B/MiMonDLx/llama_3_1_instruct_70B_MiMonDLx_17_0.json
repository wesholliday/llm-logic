However, it does not exclude other possibilities. The statement 'The zibber might be wozzle flim or quibble frazzle fribble' includes the original possibility ('The zibber might be wozzle flim') and adds another possibility ('The zibber might be quibble frazzle fribble'). Since the original statement does not rule out other possibilities, we can infer that 'The zibber might be wozzle flim or quibble frazzle fribble' is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
