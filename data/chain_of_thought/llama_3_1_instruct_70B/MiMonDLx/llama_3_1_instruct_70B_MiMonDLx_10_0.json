However, it does not provide any information about the snork being wobble. The statement only mentions the possibility of the snork being plonk, but it does not exclude other possibilities. In logic, this is known as the 'disjunction introduction' rule, which states that if a statement 'p' is true, then 'p or q' is also true for any statement 'q'. \n\nIn this case, 'p' is 'The snork might be plonk' and 'q' is 'The snork might be wobble'. Since 'p' is given, we can infer 'p or q', which is 'The snork might be plonk or wobble'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
