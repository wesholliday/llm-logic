The first statement 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo' is a conditional statement where 'Joe went to the park' is the antecedent (or condition) and 'Lucy went to the zoo' is the consequent. The second statement 'Lucy went to the zoo' confirms the consequent. \n\nHowever, in logic, affirming the consequent does not necessarily imply the antecedent. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. In other words, just because the consequent is true, we cannot conclude that the antecedent is true. There could be other reasons why Lucy went to the zoo, not necessarily because Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
