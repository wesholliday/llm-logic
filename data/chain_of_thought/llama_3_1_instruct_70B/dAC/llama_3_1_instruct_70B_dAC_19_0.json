The first statement is 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', which can be represented as 'If A, then B'. The second statement is 'Jen watched basketball', which is the consequent 'B'. \n\nIn logic, this is an example of affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. It does not necessarily mean that the antecedent 'A' (Tom watched football) is true. There could be other reasons why Jen watched basketball, and it does not have to be because Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
