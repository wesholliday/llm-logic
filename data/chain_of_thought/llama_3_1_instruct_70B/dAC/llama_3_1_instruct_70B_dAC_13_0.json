            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement and a categorical statement. The conditional statement 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' implies that if the car is indeed red, then the truck must be blue. However, it does not guarantee that the car is red if the truck is blue. This is because there could be other reasons why the truck is blue, unrelated to the color of the car.\n\nIn logical terms, the conditional statement is of the form 'If A, then B' (A \u2192 B), and the categorical statement is 'B'. From 'A \u2192 B' and 'B', we cannot logically deduce 'A'. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nAnswer: No",
