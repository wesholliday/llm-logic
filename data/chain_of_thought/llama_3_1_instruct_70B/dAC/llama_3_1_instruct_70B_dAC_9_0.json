The first statement is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', which can be represented as 'If A, then B'. The second statement is 'Mark bought the blue shirt', which is the consequent 'B'. \n\nIn logic, this is an example of affirming the consequent, which is a fallacy. It does not necessarily mean that the antecedent 'A' (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt, and it does not provide enough information to conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
