            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The investment might offer high returns' from 'The investment might be risky and offer high returns', we need to analyze the given statement. The statement contains two clauses: 'The investment might be risky' and 'offer high returns'. The word 'and' is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both conditions are being described together. However, the word 'might' is only applied to 'be risky', but it is reasonable to assume that the uncertainty also applies to 'offer high returns' since both clauses are connected. Therefore, it is logical to infer that the investment might offer high returns.\n\nAnswer: yes",
