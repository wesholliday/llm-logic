The statement 'The artwork might be authentic and worth millions' implies two possibilities: the artwork is authentic and worth millions, or it is not authentic but still worth millions. However, the statement primarily focuses on the possibility of the artwork being both authentic and worth millions. \n\nGiven this, we can deduce that if the artwork is indeed authentic, it might be worth millions. However, the statement also implies that the artwork's value is tied to its authenticity. \n\nDespite this, the statement does provide a possibility that the artwork is worth millions, regardless of its authenticity. Therefore, we can infer that the artwork might be worth millions, even if we are not certain about its authenticity.\n\nAnswer: yes",
