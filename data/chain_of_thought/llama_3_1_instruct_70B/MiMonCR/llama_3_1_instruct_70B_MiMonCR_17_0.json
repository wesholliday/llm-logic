The statement contains two possibilities: the performance might be improvised, and it might feature guest artists. These are two separate possibilities connected by 'and', which means both are being considered as potential aspects of the performance. Since 'feature guest artists' is explicitly mentioned as a possibility, we can conclude that it is indeed a possible aspect of the performance.\n\nAnswer: yes",
