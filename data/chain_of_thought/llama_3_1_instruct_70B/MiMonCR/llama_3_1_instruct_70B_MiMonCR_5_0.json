The original statement contains two conditions: 'The experiment might be successful' and 'yield groundbreaking results'. The word 'and' is used to connect these two conditions, indicating that both are part of the same possibility. \n\nSince 'yield groundbreaking results' is already part of the original statement, we can logically infer that 'The experiment might yield groundbreaking results' is a possible outcome, regardless of the success of the experiment. The success of the experiment is not a necessary condition for it to yield groundbreaking results in this inference, as the original statement already includes the possibility of yielding groundbreaking results.\n\nAnswer: yes",
