            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The recipe might require exotic ingredients' from 'The recipe might be complicated and require exotic ingredients', we need to analyze the given statement. The statement contains two conditions: the recipe might be complicated, and it might require exotic ingredients. These conditions are connected by 'and', which means both conditions are being presented together. However, the presence of 'and' does not imply that the two conditions are interdependent. \n\nIn this case, we can break down the statement into two separate conditions: 'The recipe might be complicated' and 'The recipe might require exotic ingredients'. Since 'The recipe might require exotic ingredients' is explicitly stated as one of the conditions, we can directly infer this statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
