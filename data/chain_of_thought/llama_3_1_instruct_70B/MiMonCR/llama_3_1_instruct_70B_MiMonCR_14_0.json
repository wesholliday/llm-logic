            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The meeting might involve important decisions' from 'The meeting might be confidential and involve important decisions', we need to analyze the given statement. The statement contains two clauses: 'The meeting might be confidential' and 'involve important decisions'. The word 'and' is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both conditions are being considered together. However, the use of 'and' does not imply that the two conditions are dependent on each other. \n\nIn this case, 'involve important decisions' is a separate condition that is being stated alongside 'The meeting might be confidential'. Therefore, even if we are not certain about the confidentiality of the meeting, we can still infer that the meeting might involve important decisions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
