The statement contains two clauses: 'The technology might be revolutionary' and 'change the industry'. The word 'and' is used to connect these two clauses, indicating that both clauses are part of the same statement. \n\nSince 'change the industry' is already a part of the original statement, we can directly infer that 'The technology might change the industry' is a possible outcome, as it is explicitly mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
