The statement 'The discovery might be accidental and lead to a Nobel Prize' implies two conditions: the discovery being accidental and the discovery leading to a Nobel Prize. The second condition, 'lead to a Nobel Prize', is directly mentioned in the statement. \n\nSince 'lead to a Nobel Prize' is a part of the original statement, we can logically infer that 'The discovery might lead to a Nobel Prize' is true, regardless of whether the discovery is accidental or not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
