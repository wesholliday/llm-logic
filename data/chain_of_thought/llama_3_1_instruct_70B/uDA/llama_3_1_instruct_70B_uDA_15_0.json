This type of statement only guarantees the truth of B if A is true. However, it does not provide any information about B if A is false. In this case, we are given that A (Sam took a plane) is false. Since the conditional statement does not provide any information about B when A is false, we cannot infer anything about Erin taking a train based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
