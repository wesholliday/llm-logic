            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"Tom watched football\" and B is \"Jen watched basketball\"). The second statement tells us that A is false (Tom did not watch football). However, this does not provide any information about B (Jen watching basketball). In a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is false, we cannot make any conclusions about the truth of the consequence (B). This is because the conditional statement only guarantees that if A is true, then B is true, but it does not guarantee that if A is false, then B is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
