            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer that the truck was not metal, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This statement implies that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) is also true. However, it does not provide any information about the truck's material if the doll is not plastic.\n\nThe second statement tells us that \"the doll was not plastic.\" Since the condition in the first statement is not met (the doll is not plastic), we cannot conclude that the truck is metal. However, we also cannot conclude that the truck is not metal, as the first statement only provides information about the truck's material when the doll is plastic, not when it's not.\n\nIn other words, the absence of the condition (the doll being plastic) does not necessarily negate the consequence (the truck being metal). The truck's material remains unknown based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
