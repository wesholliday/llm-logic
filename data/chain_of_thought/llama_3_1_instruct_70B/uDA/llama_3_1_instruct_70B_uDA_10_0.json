The dog was not inside.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the condition (the dog being inside) is met, then the cat is outside. However, the second statement tells us that the condition (the dog being inside) is not met. \n\nSince the condition is not met, we cannot directly infer the location of the cat from the first statement. The first statement only tells us what happens if the dog is inside, but it does not provide any information about what happens if the dog is not inside.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the cat was not outside based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
