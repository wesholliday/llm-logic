            "content": "Explanation: To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given statements. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This statement implies that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true. However, it does not guarantee that Mark bought the blue shirt if Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nThe second statement tells us that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Since the condition in the first statement is not met (Lisa did not buy the red shirt), we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. However, we also cannot conclude that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, as the first statement only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt, not what happens if she doesn't.\n\nIn other words, the first statement only provides information about the situation when Lisa buys the red shirt, but it does not provide any information about the situation when Lisa does not buy the red shirt. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
