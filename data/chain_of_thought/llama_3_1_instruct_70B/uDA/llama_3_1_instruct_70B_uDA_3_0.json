The book was not written by James.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that if the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel. However, the second statement tells us that the book was not written by James. \n\nThe first statement does not provide any information about the book's genre if it was written by someone other than James. It only provides information about the book's genre if it was written by James. Since we know the book was not written by James, we cannot infer the book's genre from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
