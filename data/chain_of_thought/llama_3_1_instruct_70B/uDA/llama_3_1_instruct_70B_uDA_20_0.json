            "content": "Explanation: The given statements are in the form of a conditional statement: \"If A, then B\" (where A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\"). However, we are also given that A is false (\"the apple was not red\"). In a conditional statement, if the condition (A) is false, we cannot make any conclusions about the truth of the consequence (B). This is because the conditional statement only guarantees the truth of B when A is true, but it does not provide any information about B when A is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
