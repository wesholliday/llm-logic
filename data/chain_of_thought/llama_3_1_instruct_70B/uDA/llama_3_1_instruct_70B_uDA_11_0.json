The first statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a conditional statement where the condition is \"the cake was chocolate\" and the consequence is \"the muffins were blueberry.\" The second statement is \"the cake was not chocolate,\" which negates the condition.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the condition is not met, we cannot directly infer the negation of the consequence. In other words, just because the cake was not chocolate, we cannot conclude that the muffins were not blueberry. The muffins could still be blueberry, or they could be something else entirely.\n\nAnswer: no",
