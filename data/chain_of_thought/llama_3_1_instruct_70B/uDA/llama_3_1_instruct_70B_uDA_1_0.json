            "content": "Explanation: The given statements can be broken down into two parts: \n1. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. This is a conditional statement, meaning that the presence of Mary at the wedding guarantees the presence of Sue at the wedding. However, it does not provide any information about Sue's presence if Mary is not at the wedding.\n2. Mary was not at the wedding. This statement provides information about Mary's absence from the wedding.\n\nCombining these two statements, we can see that the condition for Sue's presence (Mary being at the wedding) is not met. However, the absence of the condition does not necessarily imply the absence of Sue. The statement only guarantees Sue's presence if Mary is present, but it does not guarantee Sue's absence if Mary is absent.\n\nAnswer: no",
