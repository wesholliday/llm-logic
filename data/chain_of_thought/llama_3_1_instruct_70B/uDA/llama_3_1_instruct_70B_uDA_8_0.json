The vampire was not awake.\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that the vampire's wakefulness is a necessary condition for the mummy's wakefulness. However, the second statement tells us that the vampire was not awake. \n\nSince the vampire's wakefulness is a necessary condition for the mummy's wakefulness, and the vampire was not awake, we can conclude that the mummy's wakefulness is not possible under these conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
