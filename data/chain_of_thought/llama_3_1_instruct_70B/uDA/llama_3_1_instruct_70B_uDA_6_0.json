Just because the condition (Sue choosing pizza) is not met, we cannot conclude that the consequence (Bob choosing pasta) is false.\n\nIn other words, there could be other reasons why Bob chose pasta, and the fact that Sue did not choose pizza does not provide enough information to determine Bob's choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
