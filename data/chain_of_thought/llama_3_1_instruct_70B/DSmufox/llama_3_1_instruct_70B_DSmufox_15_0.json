The first statement is 'It's not the case that the dreb must be spened', which can be rewritten as 'The dreb does not have to be spened'. The second statement is 'Either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed'. \n\nUsing the second statement, we have two possibilities: either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed. However, the first statement tells us that the dreb does not have to be spened. This means the first possibility (the dreb must be spened) is not true. \n\nSince the first possibility is not true, we are left with the second possibility: the dreb is vroombed. \n\nAnswer: yes",
