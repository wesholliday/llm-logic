The first statement is 'It's not the case that the clug must be snugged', which can be rewritten as 'The clug does not have to be snugged'. The second statement is 'Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked'. \n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the clug does not necessarily have to be snugged. The second statement presents two possibilities: either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked. However, we already know from the first statement that the clug does not have to be snugged. \n\nGiven that the clug does not have to be snugged, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the clug is fleeked. \n\nAnswer: yes",
