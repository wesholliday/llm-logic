            "content": "Explanation: The given statement is \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" It implies that if the condition A (Tom watching football) is true, then the consequence B (Jen watching basketball) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the reverse situation, i.e., if Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football. This is known as the converse of the original statement, and it is not logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, just because the original statement is true, we cannot conclude that the converse is also true.\n\nAnswer: No",
