This type of statement is called a conditional statement. \n\nIn a conditional statement, the truth of the conclusion (B) depends on the truth of the premise (A). However, the converse of the statement, \"If B, then A\" (B \u2192 A), is not necessarily true. \n\nIn this case, we are trying to infer \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball\" (B \u2192 A) from the original statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" (A \u2192 B). Since the converse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true, we cannot make this inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
