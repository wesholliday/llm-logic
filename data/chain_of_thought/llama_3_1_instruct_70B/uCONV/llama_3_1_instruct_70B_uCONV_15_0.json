In other words, it does not necessarily mean that if Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane. The original statement only guarantees that if Sam took a plane, Erin took a train, but it does not provide any information about what happens if Erin takes a train. There could be other reasons why Erin took a train, and it's not necessarily related to Sam taking a plane.\n\nAnswer: no",
