However, it does not provide any information about the converse situation, i.e., if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding. The presence of Sue at the wedding does not necessarily imply the presence of Mary at the wedding, as Sue could have been at the wedding even if Mary was not. This is a classic example of a logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\" or \"assuming the converse.\" \n\nAnswer: no",
