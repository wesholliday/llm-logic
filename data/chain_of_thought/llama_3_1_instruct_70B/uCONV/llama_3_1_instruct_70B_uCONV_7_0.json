The converse of a conditional statement A \u2192 B is B \u2192 A. However, the converse is not necessarily true unless the original statement is a biconditional statement (A if and only if B).\n\nIn this case, we only have a one-way implication (A \u2192 B), and there is no information provided that suggests the converse (B \u2192 A) is also true. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
