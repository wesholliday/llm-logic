In other words, it does not imply that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta. The reverse statement would be \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta,\" or \"B \u2192 A.\" This is known as the converse of the original statement, and it is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
