However, the truth of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) does not guarantee the truth of its converse (Q \u2192 P). The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no",
