    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a blimfet, a crongle, and a narzil are the leading bafwidgers. Experts expect the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most this year, followed by the crongle, with the narzil bafwidging much less. These are the only major bafwidgers, so if the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most. Moreover, the blimfet likely will bafwidge the most, and hence the crongle likely won\u2019t bafwidge the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The blimfet is expected to bafwidge the most this year.\n2. The crongle is expected to bafwidge the second most.\n3. The narzil is expected to bafwidge much less than both the blimfet and the crongle.\n4. These are the only major bafwidgers.\n5. If the crongle doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, then if the blimfet doesn\u2019t bafwidge the most, the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nFrom point 5, we have a conditional statement: If not crongle, then if not blimfet, then narzil. This can be simplified to: If both the crongle and the blimfet do not bafwidge the most, then the narzil will bafwidge the most.\n\nSince the blimfet is likely to bafwidge the most, the scenario where the blimfet does not bafwidge the most is less likely. However, if that less likely scenario occurs, then the narzil will bafwidge the most, because the crongle is also not expected to bafwidge the most.\n\nTherefore, even though it's not the most likely overall scenario (since the blimfet is expected to bafwidge the most), within the context of the blimfet not bafwidging the most, it does follow that it's likely the narzil will bafwidge the most, because the narzil is the only remaining major bafwidger.\n\nAnswer: yes",
