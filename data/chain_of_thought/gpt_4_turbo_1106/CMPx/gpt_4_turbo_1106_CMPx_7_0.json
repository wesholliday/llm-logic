    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The crastin is expected to birth the most offspring.\n2. The nivet is expected to birth the second most offspring.\n3. The jomial is expected to birth many fewer offspring than the crastin and nivet.\n4. If the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will.\n5. The crastin is likely to lead births, which implies the nivet is likely not to lead births.\n\nFrom point 4, we have a conditional statement that sets up a hierarchy of likelihood for leading births: if not nivet, then if not crastin, then jomial. This means that the jomial is the least likely to lead births, but it will do so if both the crastin and nivet do not.\n\nFrom point 5, we know that the crastin is likely to lead births. This reduces the likelihood that either the nivet or the jomial will lead births.\n\nThe question asks if it's likely that if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will. Based on the information given, if the crastin does not lead births, the nivet is the next most likely to do so, not the jomial. The jomial only becomes the likely candidate if both the crastin and nivet do not lead births.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that it's likely that if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will, because the nivet is more likely than the jomial to lead births if the crastin does not.\n\nAnswer: no",
