    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Fantole is expected to retain the top spot in downloads.\n2. Dribban is expected to follow Fantole in the number of downloads.\n3. Cruggit has a significantly lower download rate compared to the other two.\n4. If Dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if Fantole isn\u2019t, Cruggit will be.\n5. Since Fantole is likely to lead downloads, Dribban likely won\u2019t be the most downloaded.\n\nFrom point 4, we have a conditional statement: If Dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if Fantole isn\u2019t, Cruggit will be. This means that Cruggit being the most downloaded is contingent upon both Fantole and Dribban not being the most downloaded.\n\nGiven that Fantole is likely to be the most downloaded (point 1), the likelihood of Dribban or Cruggit being the most downloaded is reduced. However, the question asks us to consider the scenario where Fantole isn't the most downloaded. In this scenario, according to point 4, if Fantole isn't the most downloaded and Dribban isn't either, then Cruggit will be.\n\nSince the likelihood of Fantole leading is high, the scenario where Fantole isn't the most downloaded is unlikely. However, we are asked to consider this unlikely scenario. In this unlikely scenario, the statement implies that Cruggit would be the most downloaded if both Fantole and Dribban aren't.\n\nTherefore, given the conditions, it does follow that if the unlikely event of Fantole not being the most downloaded occurs, it is likely that Cruggit will be the most downloaded, because the statement provided dictates that outcome.\n\nAnswer: yes",
