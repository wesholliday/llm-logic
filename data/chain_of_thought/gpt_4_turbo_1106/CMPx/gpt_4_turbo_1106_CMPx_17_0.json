    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The flinker is highly probable to have a breakout season.\n2. The dringen is also likely, but less so than the flinker.\n3. The n\u00fcffen is an outside shot, meaning it's less likely than the other two.\n\nWe are told that if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. This is a conditional statement that sets up a scenario where the n\u00fcffen's success is dependent on both the flinker and the dringen not having breakout seasons.\n\nSince scouts believe the flinker is likely to have a breakout season, the first condition (the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season) is less likely to be met. However, we are considering the hypothetical scenario where the flinker does not have a breakout season.\n\nGiven this hypothetical scenario, the statement tells us that the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season if both the flinker and the dringen do not. Since we are assuming the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, and we know that if the flinker doesn't, then the n\u00fcffen will (assuming the dringen also doesn't), it follows that in this hypothetical scenario, it is likely that the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
