The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. There is one open zulision.\n2. There are three applicants: a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect.\n3. The jantiz is the most qualified, followed by the cramen, with the sulect being the least qualified.\n4. The jantiz is likely to get the zulision, which implies the cramen is likely not to get it.\n5. If the cramen doesn't get the zulision, and if the jantiz also doesn't get it, then the sulect will get it by default, as they are the only three applicants.\n\nThe question asks if it's likely that, if the jantiz doesn't get the zulision, the sulect will. Since the jantiz is likely to get the zulision, the scenario where the jantiz doesn't get it is already unlikely. However, in that unlikely scenario, the cramen would be the next most qualified and thus would be the next likely candidate to get the zulision, not the sulect.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that it's likely the sulect will get the zulision if the jantiz doesn't, because the cramen is still more qualified than the sulect and would be considered before the sulect.\n\nAnswer: no",
