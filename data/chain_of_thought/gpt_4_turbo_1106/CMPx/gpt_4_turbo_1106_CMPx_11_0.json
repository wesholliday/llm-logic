    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. There are three candidates: a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid.\n2. The trenist is the front runner, the lanken is second, and the draloid is a long shot.\n3. If the lanken doesn't win, and the trenist doesn't win, then the draloid will win.\n4. It is likely that the trenist will win, which implies it is likely that the lanken won't win.\n\nThe question asks if it's likely that if the trenist doesn't win, the draloid will win. Since the trenist is the front runner and likely to win, the scenario where the trenist doesn't win is already less likely. However, in that less likely scenario, the only two remaining candidates are the lanken and the draloid. Since the lanken is also unlikely to win (as it's likely the trenist will win), if the trenist doesn't win, we are left with the lanken and the draloid. The statement provided tells us that if the lanken doesn't win, the draloid will win.\n\nSo, in the unlikely event that the trenist doesn't win, the next likely candidate (the lanken) is also unlikely to win, which leaves the draloid as the winner by default. Therefore, within the context of the unlikely scenario where the trenist doesn't win, it becomes likely that the draloid will win.\n\nAnswer: yes",
