    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jentil, a lomfry, and a darsal are the leading gardam suppliers this quarter. Industry analysts expect the jentil likely will sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower. These dominate gardam sales, so if the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn\u2019t, the darsal will. Moreover, the jentil likely will lead gardam sales and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, the darsal will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The jentil is likely to sell the most gardam.\n2. The lomfry is expected to sell the second most.\n3. The darsal is expected to sell significantly less than the other two.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the jentil does not sell the most gardam, then the lomfry or the darsal would have to be the top seller.\n- Since the lomfry is expected to be second, it would be the next likely candidate to sell the most if the jentil does not.\n- However, the statement also says that if the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most, then the darsal will, assuming the jentil also doesn't sell the most.\n\nGiven that the jentil is likely to lead, the lomfry is less likely to lead. If the jentil doesn't lead, the lomfry would be the next likely, but if the lomfry also doesn't lead, then the darsal will.\n\nTherefore, it does follow that if the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, the darsal will, because the lomfry is unlikely to lead if the jentil doesn't.\n\nAnswer: yes",
