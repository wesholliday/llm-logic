    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. There are three candidates for the position of snarggle: a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul.\n2. The crinel is the frontrunner, the nafiz is second, and the tomul is a long shot.\n3. If the nafiz isn't named snarggle and the crinel isn't named snarggle, then the tomul will be named snarggle.\n4. It is likely that the crinel will be named snarggle, which implies it is likely that the nafiz won't be.\n\nFrom point 3, we know that the tomul's chance of becoming snarggle is contingent upon both the crinel and the nafiz not being named snarggle. Since it is likely that the crinel will be named snarggle (point 4), the likelihood of both the crinel and the nafiz not being named snarggle is low.\n\nTherefore, even though the tomul will be named snarggle if both the crinel and the nafiz are not named snarggle, the likelihood of that scenario occurring is low because it is likely that the crinel will be named snarggle.\n\nNow, the question asks if it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be. Since the crinel is likely to be named snarggle, the scenario where the crinel isn't named snarggle is unlikely. However, in the unlikely event that the crinel isn't named snarggle, the tomul's chances increase because the nafiz is also less likely to be named snarggle (as the crinel is the frontrunner).\n\nSo, while it is unlikely for the crinel not to be named snarggle, if that unlikely event were to happen, it would indeed be likely that the tomul would be named snarggle, because the tomul is the only remaining candidate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
