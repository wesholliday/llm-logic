            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or open for limited hours\" suggests two possibilities regarding the restaurant's operational status on Mondays. The first possibility is that the restaurant is completely closed on Mondays. The second possibility is that the restaurant is open, but for limited hours compared to other days.\n\nThe statement you're asking to infer, \"The restaurant might be closed on Mondays or it might be open for limited hours,\" is essentially a rephrasing of the original statement. It maintains the same two possibilities without adding any new information or changing the meaning of the original statement. The use of \"might\" in both parts of the inferred statement preserves the uncertainty about the restaurant's status on Mondays.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement is a valid restatement of the original one, as it conveys the same possibilities regarding the restaurant's operational status on Mondays.\n\nAnswer: yes",
