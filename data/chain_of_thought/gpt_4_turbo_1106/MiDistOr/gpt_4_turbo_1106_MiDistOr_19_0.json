            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The application might be completed online or in person\" suggests that there are two possible methods for completing the application: online or in person. The use of \"or\" indicates that either of the two options is viable. When the sentence is rephrased to \"The application might be completed online or it might be completed in person,\" it maintains the same meaning, with the repetition of \"might be completed\" simply adding emphasis to each option individually. The inference does not change the original meaning or introduce any new information; it merely restates the two possibilities in a slightly more explicit manner. Therefore, we can infer that the rephrased sentence conveys the same possibility as the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
