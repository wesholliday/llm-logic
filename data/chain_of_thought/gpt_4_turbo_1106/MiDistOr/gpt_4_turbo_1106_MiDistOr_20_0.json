            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The event might be formal or semi-formal\" suggests that there are two possibilities for the nature of the event: it could be formal, or it could be semi-formal. The use of \"or\" in this context indicates that either one of the conditions could be true. Therefore, when restating this as \"The event might be formal or it might be semi-formal,\" the meaning remains the same. Each part of the sentence (\"The event might be formal\" and \"it might be semi-formal\") represents a possibility, and the use of \"or\" continues to indicate that either one of these possibilities could apply to the event. Thus, the inference maintains the original meaning without adding or subtracting information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
