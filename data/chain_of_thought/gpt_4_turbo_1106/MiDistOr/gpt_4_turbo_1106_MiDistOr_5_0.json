            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow\" suggests that there are two possible days on which the package could be delivered: today or tomorrow. The use of \"or\" in this context indicates that the delivery could occur on one day or the other, but not necessarily both. \n\nWhen the statement is rephrased to \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow,\" it maintains the same meaning. Each part of the statement (\"might be delivered today\" and \"might be delivered tomorrow\") reflects a possibility for the delivery day. The rephrased statement does not change the original meaning; it simply makes explicit the possibility of delivery on each day separately. Therefore, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement without altering the intended meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
