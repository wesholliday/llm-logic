            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" suggests that there are two possibilities for the state of the document: it could be signed, or it could be notarized. The use of \"or\" in this context is inclusive, meaning that it does not exclude the possibility that both conditions could be true; the document might be signed, it might be notarized, or it might be both signed and notarized.\n\nWhen the statement is rephrased as \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized,\" it retains the same meaning as the original statement. It still presents the same two possibilities without excluding the potential for both to be true. Therefore, the inference maintains the original meaning and does not add or subtract information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
