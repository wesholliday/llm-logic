            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\" presents two possibilities for the status of the meeting: it either will start at 2 PM or it will not happen at all because it will be cancelled. The use of \"might\" indicates that there is uncertainty about whether the meeting will start at the specified time or not happen at all. The proposed inference \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\" is essentially a restatement of the original sentence, with the addition of \"it might\" before \"be cancelled\" to maintain parallel structure and clarify that both starting at 2 PM and being cancelled are possibilities. The meaning of the two statements is the same, as both suggest that there are two potential outcomes for the meeting: starting at the given time or not occurring. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first because it conveys the same uncertainty and possibilities regarding the meeting's occurrence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
