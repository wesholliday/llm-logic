            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence \"The room might be cleaned daily or upon request\" suggests that there are two possible scenarios for the room being cleaned. The use of \"or\" indicates that either of the two conditions can apply. The first part of the sentence, \"The room might be cleaned daily,\" implies that there is a possibility of the room being cleaned every day. The second part, \"upon request,\" implies that there is a possibility of the room being cleaned when a request is made for it. When restating this as \"The room might be cleaned daily or it might be cleaned upon request,\" the meaning remains the same, with \"it might be\" simply being repeated for clarity. Both parts of the sentence are still conditional and indicate possibilities, not certainties. Therefore, the inference maintains the original meaning and is a valid restatement of the possibilities presented in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
