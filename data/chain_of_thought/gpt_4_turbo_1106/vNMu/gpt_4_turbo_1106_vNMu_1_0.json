            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise is: \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\nThis statement suggests that there is no necessity for Mary to have been at the wedding. It does not assert that Mary was definitely not at the wedding, but rather that her presence was not mandatory.\n\nThe conclusion is: \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\nThis statement suggests that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nThe argument is taking a statement about a lack of necessity (Mary not being required to be at the wedding) and infers from it the possibility that Mary was not there. Since the premise denies a necessity, it allows for the possibility that the negated event (Mary's attendance) did not occur. Therefore, the conclusion that Mary might not have been at the wedding is a reasonable inference from the premise that Mary's attendance was not necessary.\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion (Mary might not have been at the wedding) is a possibility that is consistent with the premise (It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding).\n\nAnswer: yes",
