Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside.\n\nThe first statement tells us that Fido is definitely not in the garden. The second statement presents a dichotomy: Fido must be in one of two places, either in the garden or inside.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that Fido is not in the garden, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that Fido must be inside.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
