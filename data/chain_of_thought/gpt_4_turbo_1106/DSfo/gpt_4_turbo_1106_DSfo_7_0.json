We also have the statement \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\"\n\nFrom statement 1, we know the umbrella is not in the closet. Statement 2 presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where there are only two possibilities for the location of the umbrella: it is either in the closet or in the car.\n\nSince we have established that the umbrella is not in the closet, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in statement 2 is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
