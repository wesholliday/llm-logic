    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs.\n2. Georgia is projected to add the second most jobs, closely following Tennessee.\n3. Missouri's job growth is projected to be significantly lower than both Tennessee and Georgia.\n4. If Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then Missouri will only if Tennessee also doesn\u2019t.\n\nFrom the last point, we understand that Missouri's chance to add the most jobs is conditional on both Tennessee and Georgia not adding the most jobs. Since it's stated that Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, the likelihood of Missouri adding the most jobs is already low because the condition for Missouri to lead is that both Tennessee and Georgia do not.\n\nGiven that Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs, the likelihood of the scenario where Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs is low. Therefore, the likelihood that Missouri will add the most jobs is also low because it's contingent upon both Tennessee and Georgia not adding the most jobs.\n\nSo, does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will? No, because even if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Georgia is still more likely than Missouri to add the most jobs, as it's projected to be the second after Tennessee.\n\nAnswer: no",
