    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit this year.\n2. Bananas are expected to be the second top-selling fruit, close behind apples.\n3. Oranges are expected to sell significantly less than apples and bananas.\n4. If bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be.\n5. Since apples are likely to be the top seller, it is likely that bananas won't be.\n\nFrom point 4, we have a conditional statement that if bananas aren't the top seller, then if apples aren't, oranges will be. This means that in the scenario where apples do not end up being the top seller, the next likely candidate according to the information would be bananas. However, if bananas also aren't the top seller, then oranges will be by default, since they are the only remaining option among the top three.\n\nGiven that apples are likely to be the top seller, the scenario where apples aren't the top seller is already considered less likely. However, the question asks us to consider the likelihood of oranges being the top seller if apples are not. Since bananas are the only other fruit that could potentially outsell apples, and if we are considering a scenario where apples are not at the top, we must then evaluate the likelihood of bananas being the top seller.\n\nIf bananas are also not the top seller (which is a possibility, albeit less likely since apples are likely to be the top), then oranges will be the top seller by the process of elimination. Therefore, given the information that if bananas aren't the top seller, then if apples aren't, oranges will be, it does follow that if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be the top seller, albeit this is a less likely scenario given the initial premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
