    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. Coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages.\n2. Coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers.\n3. Tea is likely to retain the second most morning drinkers.\n4. Soda is consumed much less in the mornings compared to coffee and tea.\n5. If tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nFrom point 2, we know that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers. This implies that the likelihood of coffee not retaining the most morning drinkers is low.\n\nHowever, the statement we need to evaluate is conditional: \"if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\" This is a hypothetical scenario that considers what would happen if the likely event (coffee retaining the most morning drinkers) does not occur.\n\nGiven that tea is likely to retain the second most morning drinkers, and soda is consumed much less in the mornings, the initial assumption is that soda is the least likely to retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nHowever, the statement provided in point 5 sets up a logical sequence that must be followed if the conditions are met. It states that if tea does not retain the most morning drinkers, and then coffee also does not retain the most morning drinkers, soda will be the one to retain the most morning drinkers. This is because, by elimination, if neither coffee nor tea retains the most morning drinkers, soda is the only remaining option among the major morning drinks.\n\nTherefore, even though it is unlikely for coffee not to retain the most morning drinkers, if that unlikely event were to happen, and tea also does not retain the most, then it follows from the information given that soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: yes",
