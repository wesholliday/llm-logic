    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the Democrats, Republicans, and Libertarians are the leading political parties. Based on recent polling, the Democrats likely will gain the most new voters, followed by Republicans, with Libertarians trailing distantly. These are the only major parties, so if Republicans don\u2019t gain the most voters, then if Democrats don\u2019t, Libertarians will. Moreover, Democrats likely will gain the most voters and hence Republicans likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Democrats don't gain the most voters, Libertarians will?",

Republicans are next likely to gain the most new voters after Democrats.\n3. Libertarians are trailing distantly and are the least likely to gain the most new voters.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer the following:\n\n- If the Democrats do not gain the most new voters, then the Republicans or Libertarians must gain the most new voters, since these are the only major parties mentioned.\n- Since the Republicans are more likely to gain the most new voters than the Libertarians (as they are second after Democrats), it would be more likely that Republicans would gain the most new voters if the Democrats do not.\n- Therefore, if the Democrats don't gain the most voters, it is not likely that the Libertarians will, because the Republicans are more likely to do so than the Libertarians.\n\nGiven this reasoning, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: no",
