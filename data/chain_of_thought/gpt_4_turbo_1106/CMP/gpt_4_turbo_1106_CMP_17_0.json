    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

            "content": "Let's break down the information given:\n\n1. The flu is expected to infect the most patients.\n2. The common cold is expected to infect the second most number of patients.\n3. Strep throat is expected to infect the fewest patients.\n4. These are the only major illnesses spreading.\n5. If colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will.\n6. Since the flu likely will infect the most, it is likely that colds won\u2019t infect the most.\n\nFrom point 5, we have a conditional statement that if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. This means that the only condition where strep will infect the most people is if both the flu and the common cold do not infect the most people.\n\nGiven that the flu is likely to infect the most people (point 1), it is unlikely that the common cold will infect the most. Therefore, if the flu does not end up infecting the most people, the only remaining illness that could infect the most people, given the expectations, is strep throat.\n\nSince the flu is likely to infect the most, and the common cold is less likely to infect the most, it follows that if the flu does not infect the most, the only remaining likely scenario is that strep will infect the most.\n\nAnswer: yes",
