            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence contains two clauses connected by 'and', which are 'The project must have been completed by Friday' and 'it must have been under budget'. The second clause starts with 'it', which refers back to 'The project'. When creating a shorter version of this sentence, it is common to remove the repeated subject and auxiliary verb in the second clause if they are the same as in the first clause, to avoid redundancy. In this case, 'it' and 'must have been' are repeated and can be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence. Therefore, the shortened sentence would still convey that the project had to satisfy two conditions: being completed by Friday and being under budget.\n\nAnswer: yes",
