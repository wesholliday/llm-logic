            "content": "Explanation: The original statement contains two conditions that must be met: (1) the car must be in the garage, and (2) the car must need repairs. The conjunction \"and\" in the original statement indicates that both conditions are true simultaneously. The statement you're asking about, \"The car must be in the garage and need repairs,\" essentially conveys the same two conditions without the repetition of \"must.\" The use of \"must\" in the second part of the original statement is redundant because the conjunction \"and\" already implies that the second condition is equally necessary. Therefore, the inference maintains the original meaning without the redundancy of repeating \"must.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
