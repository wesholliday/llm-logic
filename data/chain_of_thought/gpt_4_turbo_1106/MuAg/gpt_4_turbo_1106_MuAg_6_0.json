            "content": "Explanation: The original statement contains two separate assertions connected by 'and': (1) the concert must have been sold out, and (2) it must have started at 8 PM. Both assertions are presented with a degree of certainty indicated by the word 'must'. When these two assertions are combined into a single statement without changing the tense or the certainty of either part, the meaning of the original statement is preserved. Therefore, the combined statement 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM' maintains the same assertions as the original: the concert being sold out and the concert starting at 8 PM, both with the same degree of certainty. Thus, we can infer the combined statement from the original without altering the meaning or the certainty of the individual parts.\n\nAnswer: yes",
