            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence contains two clauses connected by 'and', both of which are preceded by 'must have been'. The first clause is 'The movie must have been in English' and the second clause is 'it must have had subtitles'. The word 'it' refers back to 'The movie'. When rephrasing the sentence, it is grammatically correct to omit the second instance of 'must have been' because it is understood from the first clause that the modal 'must' and the perfect aspect 'have been' apply to both clauses. This is a common way to avoid repetition in English. Therefore, the rephrased sentence 'The movie must have been in English and had subtitles' retains the original meaning without the repetition of 'must have been'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
