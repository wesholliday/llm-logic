            "content": "Explanation: The original statement contains two pieces of information about the package: 1) it must have been delivered today, and 2) it must have been signed for. The conjunction \"and\" in the original statement indicates that both conditions are true. The second statement is essentially the same as the first, but with the repeated phrase \"it must have been\" removed before \"signed for.\" This does not change the meaning of the statement because the necessity (indicated by \"must have been\") still applies to both conditions. Therefore, the inference retains the original meaning and the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
