            "content": "Explanation: The original statement contains two requirements for the application: 1) it must have been completed online, and 2) it must have included references. The conjunction \"and\" in the original statement indicates that both conditions are necessary and must be met. The second statement you've provided essentially repeats these two requirements but omits the repeated modal verb \"must have.\" This omission does not change the meaning of the requirements; it simply avoids repetition of the phrase \"must have been.\" The core meaning\u2014that the application was completed online and included references\u2014remains the same in both statements. Therefore, we can infer that the second statement is a valid restatement of the first, maintaining the same requirements without the repetition of the modal verb.\n\nAnswer: yes",
