            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The envelope must be upstairs and it must be under a bed\" contains two separate clauses connected by \"and.\" Both clauses are making a statement about the location of the envelope. The first clause states that the envelope is \"upstairs,\" and the second clause states that it is \"under a bed.\" When restating this as \"The envelope must be upstairs and under a bed,\" the meaning of the original sentence is preserved. The conjunction \"and\" is still connecting the two conditions that the envelope must satisfy: being upstairs and being under a bed. The repetition of \"must be\" in the original sentence is redundant for the purpose of the inference, and removing it does not change the conditions that are being described. Therefore, the inference maintains the same conditions and is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
