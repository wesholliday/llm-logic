This is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\nHowever, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement does not provide information about the situation where the griffin is not in the forest. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the truth of the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
