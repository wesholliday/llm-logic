The smip was not shripped. (Not A)\n\nWe want to know if from these statements we can infer that the smip did not lup the zoint (Not B).\n\nThe first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the smip being shripped and the smip lupping the zoint. It tells us that if the smip is shripped (A), then it definitely lupped the zoint (B). However, it does not tell us what happens if the smip is not shripped (Not A). The absence of the condition (the smip being shripped) does not necessarily mean the absence of the outcome (the smip lupping the zoint).\n\nThe second statement tells us that the condition (A) did not happen. However, without information about whether the outcome (B) can only happen if the condition (A) is met, we cannot infer that the outcome (B) did not happen just because the condition (A) did not happen.\n\nTherefore, from the statements given, we cannot infer that the smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nAnswer: no",
