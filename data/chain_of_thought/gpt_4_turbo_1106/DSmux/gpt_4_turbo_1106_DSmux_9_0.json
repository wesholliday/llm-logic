(This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the conditions must be true.)\n2. It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked. (This is a negation, meaning that the condition that the twonk must be plinked is false.)\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the condition \"the twonk must be plinked\" is not true. Since in the first statement we have an \"either/or\" situation and the \"or\" is inclusive, meaning one or the other or both must be true, and we know that \"it must be plinked\" is false, then the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that \"the twonk is varnished\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
