It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned (not B).\n\nThe first statement is a logical disjunction (A or B). The second statement negates one of the disjuncts (not B). If the disjunction is true (A or B) and one of the disjuncts is false (not B), then the other disjunct must be true to satisfy the disjunction. Therefore, if it's not the case that the fleeg must be surned, then the fleeg must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
