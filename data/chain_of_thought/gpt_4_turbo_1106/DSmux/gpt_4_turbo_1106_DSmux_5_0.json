It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the zinger does not have to be smoogled. Since statement 1 presents us with only two possibilities and we have eliminated the possibility that the zinger must be smoogled, the only remaining possibility is that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
