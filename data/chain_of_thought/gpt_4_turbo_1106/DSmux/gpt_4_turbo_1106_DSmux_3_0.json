(This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the conditions must be true.)\n2. It's not the case that the splat must be quanked. (This is a negation, indicating that the condition that the splat must be quanked is false.)\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that the condition \"the splat must be quanked\" is not true. Since in the first statement we have an \"either/or\" situation and one of the options (the splat must be quanked) is false, the only remaining possibility for the first statement to be true is that \"the splat is morphed.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
