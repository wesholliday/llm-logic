It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\n\nThe first statement presents a disjunction, meaning one of the two conditions must be true. The second statement negates the second condition of the disjunction. If the second condition (the glip must be tragged) is not true, then by the process of elimination, the first condition (the glip is slogged) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
