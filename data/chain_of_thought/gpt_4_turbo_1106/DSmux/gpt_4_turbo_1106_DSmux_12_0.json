It's not the case that the smip must be lupped (\u00acL).\n\nFrom statement 2, we know that the smip must not be lupped. Since statement 1 presents a disjunction (either S or L), and we know that L is false (because of \u00acL), then S must be true in order to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
