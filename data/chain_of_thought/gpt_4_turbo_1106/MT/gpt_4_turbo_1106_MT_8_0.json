            "content": "To solve this, we can use the logical form of the statements given:\n\n1. If the vampire was awake (V), then the mummy was awake (M). This can be written as: V \u2192 M\n2. The mummy was not awake (\u00acM).\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that the vampire was not awake (\u00acV).\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that if V is true, then M must also be true. However, statement 2 tells us that M is false (\u00acM).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (V \u2192 M) and the consequent (M) is false, we cannot directly infer the truth value of the antecedent (V). This is because a conditional statement is only false if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false. If the consequent is false, the antecedent can be either true or false and still make the conditional statement true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements given, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake just because the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
