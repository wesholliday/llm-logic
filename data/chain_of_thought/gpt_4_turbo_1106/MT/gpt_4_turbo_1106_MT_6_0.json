That is, just because \"if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true, it does not mean that \"if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza\" is true.\n\nHowever, we are not looking for the converse; we are looking for the contrapositive. The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if \u00acQ is true (Bob did not choose pasta), then \u00acP must also be true (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nTherefore, from the statements given, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
