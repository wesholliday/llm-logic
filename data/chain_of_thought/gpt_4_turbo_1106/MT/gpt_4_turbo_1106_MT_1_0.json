The contrapositive of this statement, which is logically equivalent, would be \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nGiven the second statement, \"Sue was not at the wedding,\" we can apply the contrapositive of the first statement. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
