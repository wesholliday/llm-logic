(Not Q)\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (the method of denying), if a conditional statement (If P, then Q) is accepted as true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nSo, from the statements given:\n\n1. If the car was red (P), then the truck was blue (Q).\n2. The truck was not blue (Not Q).\n\nWe can infer:\n\nThe car was not red (Not P).\n\nAnswer: yes",
