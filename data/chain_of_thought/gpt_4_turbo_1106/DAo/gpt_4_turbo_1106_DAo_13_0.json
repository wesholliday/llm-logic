            "content": "Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. \"The car was not red\" is a straightforward statement that tells us the color of the car is anything but red.\n\n2. \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that the only scenario in which we would be certain the truck is blue is if the car was red.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the car was not red, the condition for the truck being blue is not met. However, this does not necessarily mean that the truck cannot be blue under any other circumstances. The second statement does not tell us anything about the color of the truck if the car is not red.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue. The truck could still be blue by coincidence or for a reason unrelated to the color of the car.\n\nAnswer: no",
