It tells us about Joe's action regarding the park.\n\n2. \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is a conditional statement. It tells us about a scenario that would occur if Joe went to the park. However, since we know Joe did not go to the park, the condition for the statement is not met.\n\nThe conditional statement does not tell us what happens if Joe does not go to the park. It only tells us what would happen if he did. Therefore, we cannot make any definitive conclusions about Lucy's actions based on this conditional statement alone.\n\nSince we cannot determine Lucy's actions based solely on the information given, we cannot infer that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
