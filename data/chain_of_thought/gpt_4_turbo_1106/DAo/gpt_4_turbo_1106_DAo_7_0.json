It tells us the status of Alex regarding the race.\n\n2. \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that Chris's finishing is dependent on Alex's finishing. However, it does not tell us what happens if Alex does not finish the race.\n\nThe conditional statement is only concerned with the scenario where Alex finishes the race. It does not provide information about what happens when Alex does not finish the race. Therefore, we cannot make a direct inference about Chris's status based on Alex not finishing the race.\n\nGiven this analysis, we are now ready to answer the question.\n\nAnswer: no",
