It tells us about what would be true if Sue had chosen pizza.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that Sue did not choose pizza, the condition for the second statement is not met. The second statement only tells us what would happen if Sue did choose pizza, but since she didn't, we cannot draw any conclusions from it about Bob's choice.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer whether Bob chose pasta or not. The statements do not provide enough information to determine Bob's choice.\n\nAnswer: no",
