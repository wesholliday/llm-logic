The \"if\" part is the hypothesis (the book was written by James), and the \"then\" part is the conclusion (the book is a mystery novel).\n\nThe second statement sets a condition for the book being a mystery novel: it must be written by James. However, since we know from the first statement that James did not write the book, we cannot use this conditional statement to infer anything about the genre of the book. The genre of the book could still be a mystery novel or any other genre, regardless of who the author is.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
