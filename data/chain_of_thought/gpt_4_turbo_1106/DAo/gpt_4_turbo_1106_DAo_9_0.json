            "content": "To solve this, we can use logical deduction.\n\n1. We know that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n2. We have a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe conditional statement is an implication that has two parts: the antecedent (the \"if\" part) and the consequent (the \"then\" part). The truth of the consequent is dependent on the truth of the antecedent.\n\nSince the antecedent is false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt), the implication itself does not guarantee the truth or falsehood of the consequent (whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not). In logical terms, an implication with a false antecedent is considered true regardless of the truth value of the consequent.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not. The information provided does not give us enough to determine the truth about Mark's purchase.\n\nAnswer: no",
