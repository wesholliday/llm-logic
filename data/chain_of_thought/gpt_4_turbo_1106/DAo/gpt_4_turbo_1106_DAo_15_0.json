However, the conditional \"P implies Q\" does not allow us to infer \u00acQ from \u00acP. This is because the conditional only specifies what happens if P is true; it does not specify what happens if P is false. Erin could still have taken a train for reasons unrelated to whether Sam took a plane.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
