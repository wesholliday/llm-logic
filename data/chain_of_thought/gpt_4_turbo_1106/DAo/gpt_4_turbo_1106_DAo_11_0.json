It tells us that the condition of the cake being chocolate is necessary for the muffins to be blueberry.\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the cake was not chocolate, the condition for the muffins being blueberry (according to the second statement) is not met. However, the second statement does not tell us what happens to the muffins if the cake is not chocolate. It only specifies a condition if the cake is chocolate.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that the muffins were not blueberry because the condition provided does not cover the scenario when the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
