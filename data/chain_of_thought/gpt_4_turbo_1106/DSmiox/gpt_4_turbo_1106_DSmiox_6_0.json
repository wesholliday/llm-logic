This is an either/or scenario.\n\nGiven that the first statement does not confirm that the grommet is not plopped, we cannot be certain that the grommet must be sploffed. The first statement allows for the possibility that the grommet is not plopped, but it does not exclude the possibility that it could be plopped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The grommet is sploffed\" based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
