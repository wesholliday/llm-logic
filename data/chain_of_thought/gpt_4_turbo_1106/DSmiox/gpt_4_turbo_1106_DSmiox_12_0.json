If the smip is not shripped, then it must be lupped, and vice versa.\n\nGiven these two statements, if we assume that the smip is not lupped (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, the smip must be shripped to satisfy the condition that one of the two possibilities is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
