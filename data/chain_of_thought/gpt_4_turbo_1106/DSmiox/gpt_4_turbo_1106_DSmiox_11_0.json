However, it does not confirm that the flug is definitely not zimmed.\n\n2. \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed\" presents two possibilities: the flug is either blummed or it is zimmed. This is an either/or scenario.\n\nNow, if we consider the possibility that the flug is not zimmed (from the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only other option available is that the flug must be blummed.\n\nTherefore, if the flug might not be zimmed, and the only other option given is that it must be blummed, then we can infer that the flug is indeed blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
