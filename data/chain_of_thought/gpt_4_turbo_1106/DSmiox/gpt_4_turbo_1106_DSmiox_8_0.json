If the sprocket is not cranked, then it must be daggled, and vice versa.\n\nGiven these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The sprocket is cranked\" because the first statement does not eliminate the possibility of the sprocket being daggled; it only suggests that it might not be. Therefore, without a definitive statement that the sprocket is not daggled, we cannot infer that it must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: no",
