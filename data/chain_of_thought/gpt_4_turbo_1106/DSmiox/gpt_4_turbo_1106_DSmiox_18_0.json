However, since the first statement only suggests a possibility and does not confirm that the shank is not nugged, we cannot definitively conclude that the shank is plooked based on the information given.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The shank is plooked\" based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
