However, it does not confirm that the fribble is definitely not crinked.\n\n2. \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\" presents two possibilities: the fribble is either snurgled or it is crinked. This is an either/or scenario.\n\nNow, if we consider the possibility that the fribble is not crinked (from the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only other option available is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nTherefore, if the fribble might not be crinked, and the only other option given is that it must be snurgled, then we can infer that the fribble is indeed snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
