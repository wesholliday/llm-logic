This is a conditional statement that establishes a necessary condition for the griffin being in the forest: the presence of the unicorn.\n\nThe second statement, \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest,\" introduces the possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest. This does not contradict the first statement, as it does not assert that the unicorn definitely was not in the forest, only that it is possible that it was not.\n\nTo infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest\" from these two statements, we would need to establish that the unicorn definitely was not in the forest. Since the second statement only suggests a possibility and does not confirm the absence of the unicorn, we cannot definitively conclude that the griffin was not in the forest based solely on these statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest\" with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no",
