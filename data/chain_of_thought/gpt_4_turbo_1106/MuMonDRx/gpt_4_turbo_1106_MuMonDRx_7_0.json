            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The wibble must be zizz\" asserts that \"wibble\" has a definite state or property, which is \"zizz.\" If we are to infer \"The wibble must be wobble or zizz,\" we are considering whether \"wibble\" could also be \"wobble\" in addition to being \"zizz.\" Since the original statement does not exclude the possibility of \"wibble\" being \"wobble,\" adding an \"or\" condition does not contradict the original statement. In logic, if a statement is true, then it is also true that the statement or any other statement is true, because the original truth is not negated by the addition of an alternative. Therefore, if \"The wibble must be zizz\" is true, then \"The wibble must be wobble or zizz\" is also true, because the original condition of being \"zizz\" is included in the second statement as one of the possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
