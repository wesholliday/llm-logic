Since we already know from the original statement that the zibber is \"fizzle zibber,\" it is also true that the zibber is \"bimboozle or fizzle zibber,\" because the original condition of being \"fizzle zibber\" satisfies one of the conditions of the or statement. Therefore, the inference is logically valid because the original statement is encompassed within the broader condition of the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
