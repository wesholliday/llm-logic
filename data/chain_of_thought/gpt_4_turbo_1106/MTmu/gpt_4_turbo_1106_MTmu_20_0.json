This can be written as A \u2192 B.\n2. It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This can be written as \u00acB.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether the apple was not red, which is \u00acA.\n\nFrom the first statement (A \u2192 B), we know that if A is true, then B must also be true. However, from the second statement, we know that B is not true (\u00acB).\n\nIn a conditional statement (A \u2192 B), if B is false, then A must also be false, because a true A would require B to be true. Since we know B is false, A cannot be true; therefore, A must be false.\n\nSo, from \u00acB, we can infer \u00acA.\n\nAnswer: yes",
