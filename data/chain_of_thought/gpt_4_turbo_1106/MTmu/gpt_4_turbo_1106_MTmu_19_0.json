            "content": "To solve this, we can use logical deduction. The first statement is a conditional statement that can be represented as:\n\nIf P, then Q.\n\nWhere P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n\nThe second statement negates Q:\n\nIt's not the case that Q.\n\nTo infer whether Tom watched football or not, we look at the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven that the second statement tells us that \"not Q\" is true (Jen did not watch basketball), we can use the contrapositive to infer that \"not P\" must also be true (Tom did not watch football).\n\nTherefore, based on the contrapositive of the first statement and the truth of the second statement, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
