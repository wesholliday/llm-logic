The contrapositive of the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is \"If it's not the case that the truck must have been blue, then the car was not red.\" Since the second statement given is \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue,\" it directly affirms the antecedent of the contrapositive. Therefore, we can infer the consequent of the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
