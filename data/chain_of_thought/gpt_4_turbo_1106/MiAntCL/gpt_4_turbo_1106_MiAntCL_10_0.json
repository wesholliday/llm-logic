            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document might be signed\" indicates that there is a possibility that the document has been signed. However, this statement does not provide any information about whether the document has been notarized or not. Notarization is a separate process that typically involves a notary public who verifies the identity of the signers and witnesses the signing of the document, often stamping it with a notarial seal. Since the original statement does not mention notarization, we cannot infer that the document might be both signed and notarized based solely on the information given. To make such an inference, we would need additional information that suggests the possibility of the document being notarized.\n\nAnswer: no",
