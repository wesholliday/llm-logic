            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might be delivered today\" suggests that there is a possibility of the package being delivered. However, it does not provide any information about the specific conditions of the delivery, such as whether it will require a signature upon delivery. The addition of \"and signed for\" introduces a new condition that was not implied or stated in the original sentence. Without additional context or information indicating that a signature is required for the delivery, we cannot infer that the package being delivered today also means it will be signed for. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
