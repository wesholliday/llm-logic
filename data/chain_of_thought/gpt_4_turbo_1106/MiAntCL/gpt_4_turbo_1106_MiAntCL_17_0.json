It does not provide any information about the timing of the report's submission. To infer that the report might also \"be submitted by noon\" would require additional information that links the report's accuracy to its submission time, or at least suggests that the submission by noon is a possibility. Since no such information is provided, we cannot logically infer that the report might be accurate and be submitted by noon based solely on the statement given.\n\nAnswer: no",
