The additional detail \"and in the conference room\" introduces new information that was not included in the original statement. Without further context or information that links the meeting time to the conference room location, we cannot infer that the meeting being at 2 PM necessarily means it is also in the conference room. Inference requires a logical connection between statements, and in this case, the location of the meeting is not logically connected to the time provided in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
