It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked. (Not B)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can infer that if B is not true, then A cannot be true either because A necessarily leads to B. This is a modus tollens logical argument, which is valid. Therefore, if the fribble must not have crinked, then the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
