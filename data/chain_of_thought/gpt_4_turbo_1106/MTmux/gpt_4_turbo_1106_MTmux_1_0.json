This is a conditional statement where the blimming of the flugel is a sufficient condition for the zargling of the flugel.\n\nIt's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled. This statement negates the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\nAccording to modus tollens (a valid form of logical argument), if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the consequent (Q) is not true, then the antecedent (P) cannot be true either.\n\nApplying modus tollens to the given statements:\nP = The flugel was blimmed.\nQ = The flugel must have been zargled.\n\nSince it's not the case that Q (the flugel must have been zargled), we can infer that P (the flugel was blimmed) is not true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
