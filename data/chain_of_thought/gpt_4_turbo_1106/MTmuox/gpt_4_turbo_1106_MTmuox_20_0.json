The second statement tells us that being surned is a necessary condition for the fleeg being bluttered. Since we know the necessary condition (being surned) did not occur, the condition that depends on it (being bluttered) cannot have occurred either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
