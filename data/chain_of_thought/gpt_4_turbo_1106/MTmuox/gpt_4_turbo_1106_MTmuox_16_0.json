If the sneg was crampled, then it necessarily follows that it sproted the frink.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know that the sneg did not sprot the frink. Therefore, the condition for the sneg being crampled (which would require it to have sproted the frink) cannot be met. If it were crampled, it would contradict the information that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\nSince accepting that the sneg was crampled leads to a contradiction, we can infer that the sneg was not crampled to maintain logical consistency.\n\nAnswer: yes",
