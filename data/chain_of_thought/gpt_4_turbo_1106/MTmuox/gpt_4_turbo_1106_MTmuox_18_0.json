If the first part (the shank was plooked) is true, then the second part (the shank must have been nugged) must also be true.\n\nGiven that the first statement tells us that it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged, and the second statement tells us that if the shank was plooked, it must have been nugged, we can infer that the shank could not have been plooked because that would contradict the first statement.\n\nTherefore, the inference is that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
