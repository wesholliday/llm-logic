If the splat was morphed, then it follows that it must have quanked.\n\nGiven that we know the splat did not quank (from statement 1), and that if it were morphed it must have quanked (from statement 2), we can infer that the splat could not have been morphed. If it were morphed, it would contradict the first statement because it would have had to quank.\n\nTherefore, the inference is that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
