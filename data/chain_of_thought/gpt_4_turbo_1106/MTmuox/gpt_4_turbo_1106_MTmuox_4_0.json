The second statement tells us that if the fribble had been snurgled, it would have crinked. Since we know the fribble did not crink, it cannot be the case that the fribble was snurgled, because if it were, it would have crinked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
