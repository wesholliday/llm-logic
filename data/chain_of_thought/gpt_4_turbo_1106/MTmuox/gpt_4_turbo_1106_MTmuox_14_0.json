The second statement tells us that being snugged is a necessary condition for the clug being fleeked. Since we know the necessary condition (the clug being snugged) did not occur, we can conclude that the condition that depends on it (the clug being fleeked) also did not occur.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
