If the grommet was sploffed, then it necessarily follows that it plopped the frink.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know that the grommet did not plop the frink. Therefore, the condition for the grommet being sploffed (which would require it to have plopped the frink) cannot be met. If it were sploffed, it would contradict the first statement because it would mean the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\nSince accepting that the grommet was sploffed leads to a contradiction, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
