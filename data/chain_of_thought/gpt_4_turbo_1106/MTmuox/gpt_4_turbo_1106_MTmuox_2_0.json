For the wug to have been flooped, it must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nGiven that we know the wug did not bim the zoint (from statement 1), and that bimming the zoint is a requirement for the wug to have been flooped (from statement 2), we can infer that the wug was not flooped. If the wug had been flooped, it would contradict the first statement because it would mean the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: yes",
