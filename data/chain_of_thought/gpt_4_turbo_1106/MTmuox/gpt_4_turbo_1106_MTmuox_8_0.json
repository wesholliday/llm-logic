If the condition (the sprocket was cranked) is true, then the result (the sprocket must have been daggled) must also be true.\n\nGiven that we know the sprocket was not daggled (from statement 1), and the only way the sprocket could have been daggled is if it was cranked (from statement 2), we can infer that the sprocket could not have been cranked. If it had been cranked, it would have been daggled, which contradicts the information that it was not daggled.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
