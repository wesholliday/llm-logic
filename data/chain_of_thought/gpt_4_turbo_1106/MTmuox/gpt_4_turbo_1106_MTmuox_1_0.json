The second statement tells us that being blimmed necessitates being zargled. Since we know the flugel was not zargled, it cannot be the case that the flugel was blimmed, because if it were, it would have been zargled, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
