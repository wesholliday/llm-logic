If the condition (the dreb was vroombed) is true, then the result (the dreb must have been spened) must also be true.\n\nGiven that we know the dreb was not spened (from statement 1), and the only way the dreb could have been spened is if it was vroombed (from statement 2), we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed. If the dreb had been vroombed, it would contradict the first statement because it would mean the dreb must have been spened.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
