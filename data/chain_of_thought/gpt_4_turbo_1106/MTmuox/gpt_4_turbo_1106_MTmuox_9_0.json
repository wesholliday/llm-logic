The second statement tells us that if the twonk was plinked, it would have to be varnished. Since we know the twonk was not varnished, it cannot be the case that it was plinked, because if it were plinked, it would violate the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
