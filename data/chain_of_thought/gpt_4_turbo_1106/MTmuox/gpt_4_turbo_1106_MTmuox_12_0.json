Specifically, it says that if the smip was shripped, then it necessarily follows that the smip lupped the zoint.\n\nGiven that we know the smip did not lupp the zoint (from statement 1), and that lupping the zoint is a necessary condition for the smip being shripped (from statement 2), we can infer that the smip could not have been shripped, because if it were, it would contradict the information that the smip did not lupp the zoint.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
