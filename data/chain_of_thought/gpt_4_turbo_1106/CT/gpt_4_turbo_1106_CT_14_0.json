            "content": "To determine if the inference is valid, we need to examine the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the bear was in the cave\" and Q is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\nThe inference we are trying to make is another conditional statement of the form \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the hypothesis and the conclusion of the original conditional statement and then reversing them.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" which means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den,\" we can indeed infer that \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
