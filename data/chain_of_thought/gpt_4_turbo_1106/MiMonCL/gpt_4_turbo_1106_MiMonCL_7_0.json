            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The investment might be risky and offer high returns\" contains two separate claims about the investment: 1) it might be risky, and 2) it might offer high returns. These two claims are joined by the conjunction \"and,\" which means that both conditions are part of the statement. Since the first part of the statement explicitly says \"The investment might be risky,\" we can infer that part of the statement on its own without any additional information. The use of the word \"might\" indicates possibility, not certainty, but the inference about the riskiness of the investment is directly taken from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
