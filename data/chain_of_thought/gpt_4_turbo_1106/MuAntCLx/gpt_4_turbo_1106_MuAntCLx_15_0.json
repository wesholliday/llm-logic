The second part of the question adds \"and flimble a zibble\" to the original statement. To infer something means to deduce or conclude information from evidence and reasoning rather than from explicit statements. Without additional context or definitions for the terms used, we cannot logically infer the additional information \"and flimble a zibble\" from the original statement. The original statement does not provide any evidence or reasoning that would lead to the conclusion that 'The zizz' must also \"flimble a zibble.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer the additional information from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
