This statement does not confirm whether the smip was shripped or not; it only opens up the possibility that it might not have been.\n\n\"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" is a stronger statement. It implies that there is no necessity that the smip was shripped. This aligns with the uncertainty presented in the first statement because if there is a possibility that the smip was not shripped, then it cannot be necessary that it was shripped.\n\nTherefore, the first statement does imply that it is not necessarily the case that the smip was shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
