The second statement presents a dichotomy: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nSince the first statement negates the second part of the dichotomy in the second statement, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the notebook must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
