The second statement presents a dichotomy: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\"\n3. Since we have established that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the keys must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
