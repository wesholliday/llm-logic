We also know that either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry (an either/or statement).\n3. Since the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, the only other option given by the either/or statement is that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
