Since we know from the first statement that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, the only other option presented in this disjunction must be true to satisfy the statement.\n\nTherefore, since the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
