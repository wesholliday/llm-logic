We also know that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n3. Since the remote control isn't under the couch (from statement 1), the only other option presented is that it must be on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
