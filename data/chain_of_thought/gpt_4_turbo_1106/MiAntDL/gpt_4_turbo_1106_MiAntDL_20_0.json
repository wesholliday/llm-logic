            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The event might be formal or semi-formal\" suggests that there are two possibilities for the nature of the event: it could be formal, or it could be semi-formal. Since the statement includes the possibility that the event might be formal, it is logically consistent to infer that \"The event might be formal\" is a true statement. This is because the original statement does not exclude the possibility of the event being formal; it simply adds another possibility (that it might be semi-formal) without negating the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
