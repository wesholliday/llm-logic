            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" presents two possibilities for the status of the document: it might be signed, or it might be notarized. The use of \"or\" in this context does not necessarily imply exclusivity; it simply presents options. Therefore, it is indeed possible that the document might be signed, as this is one of the options directly stated. The statement does not rule out the possibility of the document being signed; it actually includes it as one of the potential conditions. Hence, from the given statement, we can infer that the document might be signed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
