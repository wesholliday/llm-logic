            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled\" presents two possibilities for the status of the meeting. The use of \"might\" indicates uncertainty, but it applies to both scenarios: the meeting taking place at 2 PM or the meeting being cancelled. Since the statement acknowledges the possibility of the meeting being at 2 PM, even though it is not certain, we can infer that it is indeed a possibility. Therefore, it is correct to infer that \"The meeting might be at 2 PM\" because this is one of the two options presented in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
