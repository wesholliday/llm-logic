The structure of the argument is as follows:\n\nPremise: If P, then Q.\nConclusion: If not P, then not Q.\n\nThis form of argument is not logically valid because the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Just because the first condition (the doll being plastic) leads to the second condition (the truck being metal), it does not logically follow that the absence of the first condition (the doll not being plastic) necessarily leads to the absence of the second condition (the truck not being metal).\n\nAnswer: no",
