            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" is a definitive statement indicating that the restaurant was not open at all on Mondays. The addition of \"or had limited hours\" suggests an alternative scenario where the restaurant could have been open for a reduced number of hours instead of being completely closed. However, since the original statement already establishes that the restaurant was closed on Mondays, the possibility of having limited hours on that day is already excluded. Therefore, the inference that the restaurant \"must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours\" is not adding any new information or possibilities to the original statement. It is simply restating the original fact (that the restaurant was closed on Mondays) with an additional unnecessary option (limited hours) that has already been ruled out by the initial statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
