            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal\" implies that the event had a high level of dress code and decorum. A formal event typically requires guests to dress in a manner that is more sophisticated than casual wear. \"Black-tie\" is a specific type of formal attire that is even more formal than general formal dress codes, often involving tuxedos for men and evening gowns for women.\n\nWhen we say \"The event must have been formal or black-tie,\" we are suggesting that the event could have been either simply formal or specifically black-tie, which is a subset of formal. Since black-tie is a kind of formal event, if an event is black-tie, it is also formal by definition. Therefore, if we know an event is formal, it is logically consistent to say that it could be either formal or black-tie, because black-tie is included within the broader category of formal events.\n\nAnswer: yes",
