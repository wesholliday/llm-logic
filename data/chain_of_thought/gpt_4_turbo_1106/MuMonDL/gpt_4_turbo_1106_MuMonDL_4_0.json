It does not provide any information about whether the meeting has been rescheduled or not. The addition of \"or been rescheduled\" introduces a possibility that is not supported by the original statement. Since the original statement does not imply anything about rescheduling, we cannot infer that the meeting \"must have been scheduled for 2 PM or been rescheduled\" based solely on the information given in the original statement. The original statement only confirms the initial scheduling time, not any potential changes to that schedule.\n\nAnswer: no",
