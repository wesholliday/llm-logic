            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The application must have been completed online\" specifies a particular method by which the application was completed. This method is \"online,\" which inherently implies that it was done electronically, as online processes are a subset of electronic processes. Therefore, if an application was completed online, it was also submitted electronically by the nature of being online. The statement \"The application must have been completed online or submitted electronically\" suggests that there are two possibilities: either the application was completed online or it was submitted through some other electronic means. Since completing something online is a form of electronic submission, the original statement that the application must have been completed online inherently satisfies the condition of being submitted electronically. Thus, we can infer that if the application was completed online, it also meets the criteria of being submitted electronically.\n\nAnswer: yes",
