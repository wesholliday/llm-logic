Therefore, not P (Therefore, the car was not red)\n\nThis is an example of the logical form known as modus tollens (the way that denies by denying), which is a valid argument form. If the first premise is true (if P implies Q) and the second premise is true (Q is false), then the conclusion must be true (P is false).\n\nAnswer: yes",
