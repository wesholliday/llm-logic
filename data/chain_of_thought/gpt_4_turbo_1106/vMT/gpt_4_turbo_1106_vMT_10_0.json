Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that has the following structure:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not Q.\n3. Therefore, not P.\n\nApplying this to the given argument:\n\n1. If the dog was inside (P), then the cat was outside (Q).\n2. The cat was not outside (not Q).\n3. Therefore, the dog was not inside (not P).\n\nSince the structure of the argument matches the form of modus tollens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
