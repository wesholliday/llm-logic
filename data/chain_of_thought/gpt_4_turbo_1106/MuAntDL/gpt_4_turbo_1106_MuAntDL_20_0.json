            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal or semi-formal\" suggests that there are two possibilities for the dress code of the event: it could have been formal, or it could have been semi-formal. The use of \"or\" indicates that while formal is a possibility, semi-formal is also equally a possibility. Therefore, we cannot infer that the event must have been formal exclusively, as this would exclude the possibility of it being semi-formal. The original statement allows for either option, not one to the exclusion of the other.\n\nAnswer: no",
