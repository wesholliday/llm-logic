The inference that the restaurant must have been closed on Monday ignores the second possibility that it could have been open for limited hours. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that the restaurant was closed on Monday without additional information that rules out the possibility of it being open for limited hours.\n\nAnswer: no",
