            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before\" presents two possibilities for when the package could have been delivered. It suggests that there are two potential days on which the delivery could have occurred: yesterday or the day before yesterday. The use of \"or\" in this context indicates that the delivery happened on one of these two days, but it does not specify which one. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the package was delivered yesterday; it could just as well have been the day before yesterday. To infer that it must have been delivered yesterday would ignore the other possibility presented in the statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
