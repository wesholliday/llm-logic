            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The computer might be broken\" suggests that there is a possibility that the computer is not functioning properly. The word \"might\" indicates uncertainty about the state of the computer. When we consider the statement \"The computer might be broken or working,\" we are presenting two possibilities: either the computer is broken or it is working. Since the original statement already allows for the possibility that the computer is broken, adding the possibility that it might be working does not contradict the original statement. It simply acknowledges the other potential state of the computer. Therefore, the statement \"The computer might be broken or working\" is a logical extension of the uncertainty expressed in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
