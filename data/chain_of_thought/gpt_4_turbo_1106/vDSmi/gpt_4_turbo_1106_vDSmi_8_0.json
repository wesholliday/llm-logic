The second premise introduces some doubt about the second option but does not definitively exclude it.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the second premise would need to state that the remote control is definitely not under the couch, which would leave only one possibility: that the remote control is on the coffee table. However, the second premise only suggests that the remote control \"might not\" be under the couch, which does not eliminate the possibility that it could still be there.\n\nSince the second premise does not rule out the possibility of the remote control being under the couch, the conclusion that it is on the coffee table does not necessarily follow. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
