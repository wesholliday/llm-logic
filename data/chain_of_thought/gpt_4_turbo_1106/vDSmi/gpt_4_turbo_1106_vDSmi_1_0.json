The second premise introduces a possibility that Fido might not be in the garden, but it does not confirm that Fido is definitely not in the garden. For the argument to be valid, the second premise would need to state that Fido is definitely not in the garden, which would then leave only one option \u2013 that Fido is inside.\n\nHowever, since the second premise only suggests that Fido might not be in the garden, it does not eliminate the possibility that Fido could still be in the garden. Therefore, the conclusion that Fido is inside does not necessarily follow from the premises given.\n\nAnswer: no",
