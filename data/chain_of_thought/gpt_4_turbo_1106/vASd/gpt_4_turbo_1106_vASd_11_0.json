The conclusion adds an additional condition to the premise, which is doing hard labor (R), and asserts that even with both P (getting enough sleep) and R (doing hard labor), the result will still be Q (not being tired).\n\nHowever, the premise does not provide any information about the effect of doing hard labor on tiredness. Without this information, we cannot logically conclude that doing hard labor (R) in addition to getting enough sleep (P) will not affect the outcome of not being tired (Q).\n\nTherefore, the argument assumes that the additional condition (doing hard labor) has no impact on the outcome, which is not supported by the premise. This makes the argument logically invalid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
