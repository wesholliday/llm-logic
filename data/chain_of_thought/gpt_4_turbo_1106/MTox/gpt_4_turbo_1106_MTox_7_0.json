If the condition (the whiffle being shanked) is true, then the result (the whiffle tink-ing) must also be true.\n\nNow, we know from the first statement that the whiffle did not tink. If we assume that the whiffle was shanked, then according to the second statement, it must have tinked. However, this contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, since the whiffle did not tink, and if it had been shanked it would have tinked, we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked to avoid the contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
