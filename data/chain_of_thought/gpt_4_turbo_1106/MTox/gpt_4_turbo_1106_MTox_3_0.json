We are also told \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement that can be written in logical form as: If P, then Q. Where P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nSince we know that Q is false (\"The splat did not quank\"), we can infer that P must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement. If P were true (the splat was morphed), then Q would also have to be true (the splat quanked) to satisfy the conditional statement. But since Q is false, P must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
