We also have the conditional statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we understand that \"vroombed\" is a sufficient condition for \"spened.\" In other words, if \"vroombed\" happens, then \"spened\" must also happen.\n\nSince we know that \"spened\" did not happen, we can infer that the condition that would have made it happen (\"vroombed\") also did not happen. If \"vroombed\" had happened, it would contradict the fact that \"spened\" did not happen.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
