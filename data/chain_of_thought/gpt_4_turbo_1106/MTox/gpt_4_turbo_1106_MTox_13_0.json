We also know that \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" is true. This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \"Slogged \u2192 Tragged.\"\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we can infer that if the glip was not tragged, then it could not have been slogged, because being slogged implies being tragged. Since we know the glip was not tragged, it cannot be the case that it was slogged, because that would contradict the given conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"The glip was not tragged\" and the conditional \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged,\" we can infer that \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
