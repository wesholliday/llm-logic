We also know that \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement that can be written in logical form as:\nIf P, then Q.\nWhere P is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and Q is \"it surned.\"\n\nSince we know that Q is false (\"The fleeg did not surn\"), we can infer that P must also be false in order to maintain the truth of the conditional statement. If P were true, then Q would also have to be true, but since Q is false, P must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
