We also know that \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"it was garpled.\"\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we can infer that the only way for it to be true is if whenever P happens, Q also happens. Since we know that Q (\"it was garpled\") did not happen, we can infer that P (\"the wug was sproinged\") also did not happen. If P had happened, then Q would necessarily have happened, according to the conditional statement. But since Q did not happen, P could not have happened either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
