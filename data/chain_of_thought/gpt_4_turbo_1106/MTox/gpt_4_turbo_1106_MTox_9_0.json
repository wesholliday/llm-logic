In this case, P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and Q is \"the twonk was varnished.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Q is false (\"the twonk was not varnished\"). According to the rules of logic, if Q is false in a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" then P must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement. Therefore, \"the twonk was plinked\" must be false.\n\nSo, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
