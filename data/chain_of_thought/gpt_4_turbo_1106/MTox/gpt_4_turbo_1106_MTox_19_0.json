We have the statement \"The smonk did not plagged.\"\n2. We also have the conditional statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional (if-then) statement. It can be symbolically represented as: If P, then Q. In this case, P is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and Q is \"the smonk plagged.\"\n\nThe first statement tells us that Q is false (\"The smonk did not plagged\").\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens (the method of denying), if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we know that Q is false, then we can conclude that P is also false.\n\nSo, if \"the smonk plagged\" is false, then \"the smonk was vreebled\" must also be false, because the conditional statement tells us that the smonk plagging is a necessary condition for the smonk being vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
