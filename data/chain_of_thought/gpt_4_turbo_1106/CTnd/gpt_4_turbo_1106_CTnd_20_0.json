(Where R = a recommendation was made, S = it was a strong recommendation)\n\n2. \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.\"\n   This would be written as: If S, then not R.\n\nThe second statement is the contrapositive of the first statement. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the second statement is not the contrapositive of the first; it is actually the inverse of the first statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the first statement would be: \"If it was not a strong recommendation, then a recommendation was not made,\" which can be written as: If not S, then not R.\n\nSince the second statement is not the contrapositive of the first, we cannot infer it directly from the first statement. Therefore, the answer to whether we can infer the second statement from the first is:\n\nAnswer: no",
