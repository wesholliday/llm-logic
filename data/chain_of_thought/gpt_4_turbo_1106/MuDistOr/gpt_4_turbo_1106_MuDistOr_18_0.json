            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The product must have been eco-friendly or recyclable\" implies that there are two possible attributes that the product could have had: it could have been eco-friendly, or it could have been recyclable. The use of \"or\" in this context suggests that either one of the conditions being true would satisfy the statement. Therefore, when restating this as \"The product must have been eco-friendly or it must have been recyclable,\" we are maintaining the same logical structure where either one of the two conditions being true is sufficient. The restatement does not change the meaning of the original sentence; it simply makes explicit that each condition must be true on its own. Thus, we can infer that the restated sentence is equivalent to the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
