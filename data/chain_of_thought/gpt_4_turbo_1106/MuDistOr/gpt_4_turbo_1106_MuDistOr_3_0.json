            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The book must have been on the shelf or in the backpack\" implies that there are two possible locations for the book: on the shelf or in the backpack. The use of \"or\" in this context suggests that at least one of the conditions must be true, but it does not necessarily mean that both cannot be true at the same time. The statement does not exclude the possibility that the book could have been moved from one location to the other, but it does assert that the book had to be in one of those two locations.\n\nWhen the statement is rephrased to \"The book must have been on the shelf or it must have been in the backpack,\" it maintains the same logical structure. It still presents two possibilities for the location of the book, and it still asserts that at least one of the conditions must be true. The rephrased statement does not change the meaning of the original statement; it simply repeats the possibilities in a slightly different linguistic structure.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, as both convey that the book had to be in one of the two locations mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
