            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence states that the software must have been either installed on the computer or accessed through the cloud. The use of \"or\" in this context establishes that there are two and only two possibilities for how the software was used. The phrase \"must have been\" applies to both parts of the sentence connected by \"or,\" indicating a necessity or requirement. Therefore, when restating the sentence as \"The software must have been installed on the computer or it must have been accessed through the cloud,\" the meaning remains the same. The repetition of \"must have been\" in the second part of the sentence is redundant but does not change the inference that one of the two conditions is true. Thus, the inference is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
