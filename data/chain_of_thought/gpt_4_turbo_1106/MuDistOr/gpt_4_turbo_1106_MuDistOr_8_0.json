            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" implies that there are two acceptable conditions for the document to be considered valid: it either needs to be signed or it needs to be notarized. The use of \"or\" in this context suggests that at least one of the conditions must be met, but it does not exclude the possibility that both conditions could be met. The statement does not require that only one of the conditions be true, just that at least one is.\n\nWhen the statement is rephrased as \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized,\" it maintains the same meaning. It still conveys that there are two acceptable conditions, and at least one of them must be true for the document to be considered valid. The rephrased statement does not change the original meaning or introduce any additional requirements.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the rephrased statement \"The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized\" is equivalent to the original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
