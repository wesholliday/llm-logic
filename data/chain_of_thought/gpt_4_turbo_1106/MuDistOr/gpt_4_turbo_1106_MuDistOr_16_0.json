            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or the CEO\" implies that there are two possible entities that could have approved the contract: the legal team or the CEO. The use of \"or\" in this context suggests that the approval could come from either one of the two entities, but it does not necessarily require both to have given approval. Therefore, when this statement is broken down into two separate statements, it maintains the same meaning: the contract must have been approved by either the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO. This maintains the original condition that at least one of the two entities has given approval, which is what the original statement conveys.\n\nAnswer: yes",
