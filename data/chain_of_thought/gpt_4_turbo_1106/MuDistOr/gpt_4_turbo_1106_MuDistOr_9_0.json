            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered by truck or by plane\" implies that there are two possible modes of delivery for the package: truck or plane. The use of \"or\" in this context suggests that at least one of these possibilities is true, but it does not necessarily mean that each possibility must be true on its own. The statement is a logical disjunction, which means that it is true if at least one of the disjuncts (options) is true.\n\nWhen we rephrase the statement to \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane,\" we are maintaining the same logical structure. Each part of the new statement (\"The package must have been delivered by truck\" and \"it must have been delivered by plane\") is presented as a possibility, and the \"or\" still indicates that at least one of these possibilities must be true, but not necessarily both.\n\nTherefore, the inference maintains the same meaning as the original statement, as both are asserting that there are two possible delivery methods and at least one of them must have occurred.\n\nAnswer: yes",
