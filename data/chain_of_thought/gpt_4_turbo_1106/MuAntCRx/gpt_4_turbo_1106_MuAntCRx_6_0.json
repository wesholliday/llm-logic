The second statement \"The fizzle must snizzle at shimble quazzle and gronk at zump wumble\" adds an additional action (snizzle) at a different time or place (shimble quazzle) to the original action.\n\nInferring the second statement from the first would require additional information that is not provided in the original statement. The original statement does not mention anything about \"snizzle\" or \"shimble quazzle.\" Therefore, without additional context or information, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
