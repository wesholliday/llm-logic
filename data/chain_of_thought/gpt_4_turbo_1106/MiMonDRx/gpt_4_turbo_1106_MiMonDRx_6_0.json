            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The blimple might be wibble\" suggests that there is a possibility of the blimple being wibble. When we consider the statement \"The blimple might be froodle or wibble,\" we are introducing an additional possibility (froodle) to the original one (wibble). Since the original statement does not exclude the possibility of the blimple being something else besides wibble, adding another option (froodle) does not contradict the original statement. In fact, it expands the range of possibilities. Therefore, if the blimple might be wibble, it is also true that the blimple might be froodle or wibble, because the second statement includes the first possibility as part of a larger set of possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
