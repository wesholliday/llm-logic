However, it does not provide any information about the grooble being \"snizzle flibbit gribble\" or any other additional characteristics. In logic, you cannot infer additional properties or characteristics that are not mentioned or implied in the original statement. Therefore, from the statement given, we cannot infer that the grooble might also be \"snizzle flibbit gribble\" because that would be adding information that was not present in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
