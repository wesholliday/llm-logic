We are given a conditional statement: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n\nThe conditional statement can be written in logical form as: Sue chose pizza \u2192 Bob chose pasta.\n\nSince we know the consequent (Bob chose pasta) is false, we can infer that the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) must also be false because if the antecedent were true, it would lead to a true consequent according to the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, since Bob did not choose pasta, Sue could not have chosen pizza, because if she had, it would contradict the given information that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
