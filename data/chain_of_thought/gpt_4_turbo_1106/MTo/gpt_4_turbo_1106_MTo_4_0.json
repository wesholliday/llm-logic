The structure of this statement is \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the alien visited Mars\" and Q is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Q is false (the robot did not visit Jupiter). In a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q,\" if Q is false, then P must also be false in order for the statement to be true (this is known as modus tollens in logic). Therefore, the alien could not have visited Mars, because if it had, it would imply that the robot visited Jupiter, which contradicts the given fact.\n\nSo, based on the given statements, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
