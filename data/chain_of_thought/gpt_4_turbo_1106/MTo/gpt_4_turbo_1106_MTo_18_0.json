            "content": "To solve this, we can use logical deduction.\n\n1. We know that the truck was not metal.\n2. We also know that if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a conditional statement: If P (the doll was plastic), then Q (the truck was metal). We know that Q is false (the truck was not metal). In a conditional statement, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false for the statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, since the truck was not metal, the doll could not have been plastic, because if the doll were plastic, it would imply that the truck was metal, which contradicts the information given.\n\nAnswer: yes",
