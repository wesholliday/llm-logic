            "content": "To solve this, we can use logical deduction.\n\n1. We know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n2. We are given a conditional statement: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we can infer that the only way Mark would have bought the blue shirt is if Lisa bought the red shirt. Since we know for a fact that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, the condition that would make Mark buy the blue shirt (Lisa buying the red shirt) cannot have occurred.\n\nTherefore, since the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) would lead to an outcome that we know did not happen (Mark buying the blue shirt), we can conclude that the condition itself did not happen.\n\nAnswer: yes",
