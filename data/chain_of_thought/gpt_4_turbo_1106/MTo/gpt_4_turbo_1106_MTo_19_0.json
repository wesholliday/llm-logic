            "content": "Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This is a straightforward statement about Jen's actions.\n\n2. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement. If the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the result (Jen watched basketball) must also be true.\n\nGiven that we know Jen did not watch basketball, the result of the conditional statement is false. In a standard \"if-then\" logical statement, if the result is false, then the condition that leads to it must also be false (modus tollens). Therefore, since Jen did not watch basketball, Tom could not have watched football, because if he had, it would lead to a contradiction of the result that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
