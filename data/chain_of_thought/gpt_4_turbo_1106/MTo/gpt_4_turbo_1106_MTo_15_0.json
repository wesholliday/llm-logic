It can be interpreted as: for Sam taking a plane, a necessary condition is that Erin took a train.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the condition \"Erin took a train\" is false. Since the conditional statement requires this condition to be true for Sam to have taken a plane, and we know the condition is false, it follows that Sam could not have taken a plane. If he had, it would contradict the given fact that Erin did not take a train.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
