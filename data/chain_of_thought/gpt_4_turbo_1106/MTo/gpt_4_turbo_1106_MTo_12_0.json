            "content": "To solve this, we can use logical deduction.\n\nWe have two statements:\n\n1. Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n2. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement that can be written as: If P, then Q. In this case, P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nSince we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo (\u00acQ), we can infer that the condition that would make her go to the zoo (P) did not happen. This is because if P were true (Joe went to the park), then Q would also have to be true (Lucy went to the zoo) according to the conditional statement. But since Q is false (Lucy did not go to the zoo), P must also be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
