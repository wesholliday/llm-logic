If the condition (the car being red) is true, then the result (the truck being blue) must also be true.\n\nGiven that we know the truck was not blue, the condition that would make the truck blue (the car being red) cannot have occurred, because if the car were red, then the truck would have to be blue, which contradicts the information we have.\n\nTherefore, since the truck was not blue, the car could not have been red, because if it were, it would make the truck blue, which it is not.\n\nAnswer: yes",
