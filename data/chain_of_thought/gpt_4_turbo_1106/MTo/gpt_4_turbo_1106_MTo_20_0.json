If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in logical form as: If P, then Q. In this case, P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\nAccording to the first statement, we know that Q is false (the banana was not yellow). In a conditional statement, if Q is false, then P must also be false for the statement to be true (since if P were true, Q would also have to be true, which it is not).\n\nTherefore, since we know that Q is false, and the conditional statement must be true, P must also be false. This means that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
