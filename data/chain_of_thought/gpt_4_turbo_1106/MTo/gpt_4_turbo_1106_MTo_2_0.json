            "content": "Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" is a straightforward statement that tells us the location of the unicorn is not the forest.\n\n2. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is a conditional statement. The structure is \"if P then Q,\" where P is \"the griffin was in the forest\" and Q is \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that Q is false (the unicorn was not in the forest). In a conditional statement, if Q is false, then P must also be false for the statement to be true. Therefore, the griffin could not have been in the forest, because if it were, it would make the conditional statement false (since it would imply that the unicorn was also in the forest, which contradicts the first statement).\n\nSo, from the two statements provided, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
