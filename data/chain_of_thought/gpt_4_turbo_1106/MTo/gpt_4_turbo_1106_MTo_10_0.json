It tells us that the only scenario in which the cat would be outside is if the dog was inside.\n\nGiven that the first statement contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement (because the cat was not outside), we cannot affirm the antecedent (that the dog was inside) based on these statements alone. The conditional statement only tells us what would be the case if the dog were inside, not what actually is the case.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
