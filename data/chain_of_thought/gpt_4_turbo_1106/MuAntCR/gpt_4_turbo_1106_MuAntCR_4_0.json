To infer that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room,\" we would need additional information that links the meeting to the specific time of 2 PM. Since the original statement does not mention any time, we cannot make any inferences about the time of the meeting based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
