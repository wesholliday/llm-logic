However, it does not provide any information about the timeline or completion date of the project. To infer that \"The project must have been completed by Friday and been under budget\" would require additional information that links the project's completion date with its budget status. Since the original statement does not mention anything about the project's completion date, we cannot infer that the project was completed by Friday based solely on the information that it was under budget.\n\nAnswer: no",
