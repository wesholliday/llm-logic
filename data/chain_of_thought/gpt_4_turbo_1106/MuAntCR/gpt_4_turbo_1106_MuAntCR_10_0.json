            "content": "Explanation: The process of notarization typically involves a notary public, who is an official authorized to perform certain legal formalities, especially to draw up or certify contracts, deeds, and other documents for use in other jurisdictions. For a document to be notarized, it generally must be signed in the presence of the notary. The notary's role includes verifying the identity of the signatory, witnessing the signature, and marking the document with a stamp (or \"seal\") to indicate that the notarization has taken place.\n\nGiven that notarization usually cannot occur without a signature, because the signature is part of what is being notarized, we can infer that if a document has been notarized, it must have been signed as part of that process.\n\nAnswer: yes",
