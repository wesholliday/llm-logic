The difficulty of an exam can depend on various factors such as the complexity of the questions, the time allowed for the exam, the grading criteria, and the individual student's preparedness and understanding of the material. Since the original statement does not mention anything about the difficulty, we cannot infer that the exam was difficult based solely on the information that it covered all chapters.\n\nAnswer: no",
