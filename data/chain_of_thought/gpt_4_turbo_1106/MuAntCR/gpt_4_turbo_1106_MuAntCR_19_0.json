However, it does not provide any information about the method by which the application was completed, whether online or through other means. To infer that the application must have been completed online from the original statement would require additional information that links the inclusion of references to the necessity of an online completion process. Since no such information is provided in the original statement, we cannot make this inference based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
