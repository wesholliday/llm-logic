            "content": "To solve this, let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"The splat might not have quanked\" suggests that there is a possibility that the splat did not quank. However, it does not confirm that the splat definitely did not quank.\n\n2. \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\" is a conditional statement. If the condition (the splat was morphed) is true, then the result (the splat must have quanked) is also true.\n\nNow, if we assume that the splat was morphed, then according to the second statement, it must have quanked. However, the first statement tells us that there is a possibility that the splat did not quank. If the splat did not quank, then the condition that \"if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked\" would be false. Therefore, to maintain the truth of the second statement, the splat could not have been morphed.\n\nSince the possibility exists that the splat did not quank, and if it did not quank, it could not have been morphed (to keep the second statement true), we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
