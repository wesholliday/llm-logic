            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal or semi-formal\" suggests that there are two possibilities for the nature of the event: it could have been formal, or it could have been semi-formal. This does not exclusively commit to the event being semi-formal, as it leaves open the possibility that the event was formal. To infer that \"The event must have been semi-formal\" from the original statement would be to ignore the possibility that the event could have been formal. Therefore, we cannot make a definitive inference that the event was semi-formal based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
