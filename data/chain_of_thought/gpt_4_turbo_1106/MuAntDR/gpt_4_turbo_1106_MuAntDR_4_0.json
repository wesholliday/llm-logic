            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled\" presents two possibilities for the status of the meeting. It suggests that either the meeting took place at 2 PM or it did not take place at all because it was cancelled. Without additional information indicating that the meeting did not occur at 2 PM, we cannot infer that the meeting was definitely cancelled. The statement allows for the possibility that the meeting happened at the specified time. Therefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot conclude that the meeting must have been cancelled.\n\nAnswer: no",
