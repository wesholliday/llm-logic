This means that the password could be exactly eight characters long, or it could be any length greater than eight characters. The phrase \"or longer\" allows for the possibility of the password being exactly eight characters, not just longer than eight characters.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we cannot infer that the password must have been longer than eight characters, because it could have been exactly eight characters long as well.\n\nAnswer: no",
