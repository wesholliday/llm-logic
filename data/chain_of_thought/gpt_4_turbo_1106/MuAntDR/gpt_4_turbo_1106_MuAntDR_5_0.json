It does not specify which of the two is the actual case, only that the delivery occurred on one of those two days. To infer that \"The package must have been delivered the day before\" would mean excluding the possibility that it was delivered yesterday, which the original statement does not allow us to do. Since we are given an \"or\" condition, we cannot conclude with certainty that the package was delivered on one specific day without additional information that would rule out the other possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
