            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possibilities for the status of the project. It suggests that either the project was completed by Friday or it was extended. Without additional information, we cannot infer that one of the two possibilities definitely occurred. The use of \"or\" in the statement indicates that there are two acceptable outcomes, but it does not specify which one actually happened. Therefore, based solely on this statement, we cannot conclude that the project must have been extended, as it is equally possible that the project was completed by the given deadline.\n\nAnswer: no",
