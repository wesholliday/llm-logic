            "content": "Explanation: The original statement provides two options for how the application could have been completed: online or in person. The use of \"or\" in this context indicates that either method would be acceptable. Inferring that the application must have been completed in person excludes the possibility of it being completed online, which contradicts the original statement that includes both methods as valid options. Therefore, we cannot infer that the application must have been completed in person without considering the possibility of it being completed online.\n\nAnswer: no",
