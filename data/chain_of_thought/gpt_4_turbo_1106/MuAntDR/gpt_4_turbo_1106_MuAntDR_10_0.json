            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" presents two possibilities for the document's validation: it could have been either signed or notarized. The use of \"or\" in this context suggests that at least one of the conditions must be met, but it does not necessarily mean that both conditions must be met. Therefore, from this statement, we cannot infer that the document must have been notarized, because it is possible that the document was only signed and not notarized. The statement allows for the possibility of the document being signed without being notarized, or being notarized without being signed, or both.\n\nAnswer: no",
