(This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the conditions must be true.)\n2. It's not the case that the dreb must be spened. (This is a negation, meaning the first condition is false.)\n\nSince the first statement is a disjunction and the second statement negates one of the options, the other option must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, if the dreb must not be spened, then it must be vroombed to satisfy the initial condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
