(This is a logical disjunction, which means at least one of the two conditions must be true.)\n2. It's not the case that the flob must be movated. (This is a negation, which means the first condition of the disjunction is false.)\n\nSince the first condition (the flob must be movated) is false, and because in a disjunction at least one of the conditions must be true, the second condition (the flob is skizzled) must be true to satisfy the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
