This means that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\nThe second statement negates the first part of the disjunction: it's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\n\nSince the disjunction must be true and the first part is false, the second part of the disjunction must be true to satisfy the overall statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
