Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\nThis statement can be represented as: S or F (where S represents \"the zinger must be smoogled\" and F represents \"the zinger is fraggled\").\n\n2. It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\nThis statement can be represented as: not S\n\nGiven these two statements, we can infer the following:\n\nIf it is not the case that S (the zinger must be smoogled), and the first statement tells us that either S or F must be true, then by the process of elimination, F (the zinger is fraggled) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
