            "content": "To solve this, we can break down the statements logically.\n\n1. Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed. (This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the conditions must be true.)\n2. It's not the case that the splat must be quanked. (This is a negation, meaning the first condition is false.)\n\nFrom the first statement, we have two possibilities: the splat is quanked or the splat is morphed. The second statement tells us that the first possibility is not true. Therefore, by the process of elimination, the second possibility must be true.\n\nSo, from the given statements, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
