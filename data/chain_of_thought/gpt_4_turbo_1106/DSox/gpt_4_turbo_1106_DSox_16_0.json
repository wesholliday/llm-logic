We are also given a second statement \"Either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the condition of the sneg being sproted is false. The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where one of the two conditions must be true. Since we know that the sneg being sproted is false, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction is that the sneg must be crampled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
