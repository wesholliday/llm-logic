We are also told \"Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged.\"\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement), which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. Since we know from statement 1 that \"The shank is not nugged\" is true, the only other option from the disjunction in statement 2 that can be true is \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nTherefore, given that the shank cannot be nugged, it must be plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
