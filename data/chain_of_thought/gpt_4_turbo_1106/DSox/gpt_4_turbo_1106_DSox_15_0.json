Since we know from the first statement that the dreb is not spened, the only other option from this disjunction for the dreb to satisfy is to be \"vroombed.\"\n\nGiven that the dreb cannot be \"spened,\" and the second statement tells us it must be either \"vroombed\" or \"spened,\" we can infer that the dreb must be \"vroombed\" to satisfy the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
