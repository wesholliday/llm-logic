We are also told that \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled.\"\n\nFrom the second statement, we have two possibilities: the sprocket is either cranked or daggled. Since the first statement tells us that the sprocket is not daggled, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
