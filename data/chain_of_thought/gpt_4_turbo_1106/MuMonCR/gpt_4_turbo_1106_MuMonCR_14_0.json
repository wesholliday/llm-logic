            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The contract must have been valid for a year and renewable\" contains two pieces of information about the contract: 1) it was valid for a year, and 2) it was renewable. The second part of the statement directly tells us that the contract had the feature of being renewable. Therefore, when asked if we can infer from this statement that \"The contract must have been renewable,\" we can confidently say that this inference is correct because it is explicitly stated in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
