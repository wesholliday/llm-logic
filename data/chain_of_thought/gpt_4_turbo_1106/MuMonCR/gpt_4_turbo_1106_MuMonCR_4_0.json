            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM and in the conference room\" contains two pieces of information about the meeting: the time it took place (at 2 PM) and the location where it occurred (in the conference room). The conjunction \"and\" in the sentence indicates that both conditions are true for the meeting. Therefore, if we are to infer only one of these conditions, specifically the location, we can do so without the need to reference the time. The time of the meeting (at 2 PM) is an additional piece of information but does not affect the inference about the location of the meeting. Thus, the statement \"The meeting must have been in the conference room\" is supported by the original statement, as it is a subset of the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
