            "content": "Explanation: The original statement contains two pieces of information about the restaurant: 1) it was closed on Mondays, and 2) it served Italian cuisine. The second part of the statement directly tells us that the restaurant served Italian cuisine. The inference about the type of cuisine the restaurant served does not depend on the day it was closed. Therefore, even when we remove the information about the restaurant being closed on Mondays, the statement about the restaurant serving Italian cuisine still stands on its own.\n\nAnswer: yes",
