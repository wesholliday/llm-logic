            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" contains two conditions that must be met for the document: it must be signed, and it must be notarized. The use of \"and\" in the sentence indicates that both conditions are required. Therefore, if the document must have been signed and notarized, it follows that the document must have been notarized as part of fulfilling the two conditions. The inference that the document must have been notarized is directly supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
