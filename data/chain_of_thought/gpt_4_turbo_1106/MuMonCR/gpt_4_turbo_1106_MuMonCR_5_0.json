            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" contains two assertions: one, that the package was delivered today, and two, that it was signed for. The conjunction \"and\" indicates that both conditions are believed to be true. If we are looking to infer \"The package must have been signed for\" from the original statement, we are essentially considering whether the second part of the original statement stands true on its own. Since the original statement asserts that the package was indeed signed for, irrespective of the other information about the delivery date, we can infer that the package must have been signed for.\n\nAnswer: yes",
