            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" contains two separate pieces of information about the concert: that it was sold out and that it started at 8 PM. The use of \"and\" in the sentence indicates that both conditions are believed to be true. Therefore, if we are to infer just one of these conditions, specifically that \"The concert must have started at 8 PM,\" we are focusing on the second part of the original statement, which is independent of the first part about the concert being sold out. The time the concert started does not logically depend on whether it was sold out. Thus, we can infer the start time of the concert without referencing its ticket sales status.\n\nAnswer: yes",
