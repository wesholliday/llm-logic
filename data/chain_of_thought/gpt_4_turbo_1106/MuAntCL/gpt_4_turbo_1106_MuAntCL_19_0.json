However, it does not provide any information about the content of the application or any specific requirements such as the inclusion of references. To infer that the application included references, additional information stating that references were a requirement would be necessary. Since this information is not provided in the original statement, we cannot make the inference that the application included references based solely on the information that it was completed online.\n\nAnswer: no",
