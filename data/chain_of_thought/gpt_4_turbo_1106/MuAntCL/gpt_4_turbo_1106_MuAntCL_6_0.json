It does not provide any information about the time the concert started. To infer that \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM,\" we would need additional information that confirms the starting time of the concert. Since the provided statement does not include any information about the starting time, we cannot infer the additional detail that the concert started at 8 PM based solely on the statement given.\n\nAnswer: no",
