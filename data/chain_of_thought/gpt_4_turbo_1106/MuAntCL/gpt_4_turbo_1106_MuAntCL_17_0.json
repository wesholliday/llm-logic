To infer that the report \"must have been accurate and been submitted by noon,\" we would need additional information that links the report's accuracy to its submission time. Since the original statement does not provide any details about when the report was submitted, we cannot logically infer that it was submitted by noon based solely on the information about its accuracy.\n\nAnswer: no",
