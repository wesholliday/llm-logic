However, this statement does not include any information about the envelope being under a bed. To infer that the envelope was \"upstairs and under a bed,\" additional information would be required to support the claim that the envelope was not only upstairs but also specifically under a bed. Without this additional information, we cannot logically infer the more specific location of the envelope from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
