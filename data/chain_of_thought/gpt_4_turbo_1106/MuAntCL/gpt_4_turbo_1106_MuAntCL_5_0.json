The act of signing for a package is a specific event that may or may not occur during the delivery process. Without additional information indicating that signing for the package is a required part of the delivery process or that it indeed happened, we cannot infer that the package was both delivered and signed for based solely on the statement provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
