However, it does not provide any information about the content or scope of the exam, such as whether it covered all chapters or not. To infer that the exam covered all chapters, additional information would be required that explicitly states or suggests this. Since the statement only addresses the difficulty and not the coverage of the exam, we cannot infer that the exam covered all chapters based solely on the information given about its difficulty.\n\nAnswer: no",
