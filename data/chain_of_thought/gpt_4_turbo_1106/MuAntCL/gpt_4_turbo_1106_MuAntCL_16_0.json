However, it does not explicitly mention anything about fresh towels being provided as part of that cleaning routine. The addition of \"and had fresh towels\" introduces a new piece of information that is not contained within the original statement. Without additional context that links daily cleaning to the provision of fresh towels, we cannot logically infer that fresh towels were included just based on the information about the cleaning frequency.\n\nAnswer: no",
