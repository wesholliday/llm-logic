            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The computer might be broken\" suggests that there is a possibility that the computer is not functioning properly. However, it does not rule out the possibility that the computer might also be working. The use of the word \"might\" indicates uncertainty about the state of the computer. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that if the computer might be broken, it is also true that the computer might not be broken, which means it could be working. The statement \"The computer might be working or broken\" simply acknowledges both possibilities, which is consistent with the original statement's expression of uncertainty.\n\nAnswer: yes",
