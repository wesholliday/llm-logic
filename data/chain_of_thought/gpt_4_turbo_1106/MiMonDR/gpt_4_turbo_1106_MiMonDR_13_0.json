However, it does not explicitly state that the meeting is currently scheduled. The phrase \"might be\" indicates uncertainty about the status of the meeting. \n\nWhen we consider the statement \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled,\" we are presented with two possibilities: either the meeting is scheduled or it is cancelled. This statement is broader and includes the possibility that the meeting is still on as scheduled, in addition to the possibility of it being cancelled.\n\nSince the original statement allows for the possibility of cancellation, it is also consistent with the broader statement that includes both possibilities (scheduled or cancelled). Therefore, we can infer that if the meeting might be cancelled, it is also true that it might be scheduled or cancelled, because the original statement does not exclude the possibility of the meeting being scheduled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
