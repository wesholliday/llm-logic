            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package might be delivered\" suggests that there is a possibility of the package being delivered. The addition of \"might be delayed\" introduces another possibility that does not contradict the first one. Since both possibilities (being delivered or being delayed) can coexist without conflict, and since the second statement is essentially expanding the range of possibilities to include another outcome that could occur instead of or in addition to the first, it is logical to infer that if the package might be delivered, it is also true that it might be delayed or delivered. The second statement is a superset of the first, including all the possibilities of the first statement plus at least one additional possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
