            "content": "Explanation: The original statement contains two pieces of information connected by 'and'. The first part is 'The concert might be sold out' and the second part is 'feature a famous band'. The use of 'and' indicates that both conditions can be true simultaneously. However, the second part of the statement, 'feature a famous band', is independent of the first part and can stand alone as a possibility. Therefore, inferring that 'The concert might feature a famous band' from the original statement is reasonable because this possibility is explicitly mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
