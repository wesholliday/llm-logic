            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The contract might be legally binding and have hidden clauses\" contains two separate propositions connected by the conjunction \"and.\" These propositions are:\n\n1. The contract might be legally binding.\n2. The contract might have hidden clauses.\n\nThe use of \"might\" indicates possibility for both propositions. Since the second proposition is \"The contract might have hidden clauses,\" it is already explicitly stated as a possibility within the original statement. Therefore, inferring that \"The contract might have hidden clauses\" from the original statement is simply isolating the second part of the original statement without altering its meaning or introducing any new information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
