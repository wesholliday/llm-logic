            "content": "Explanation: The original statement suggests that there is a possibility that the technology could be revolutionary and, as a result, change the industry. The phrase \"might be revolutionary and change the industry\" implies that the revolutionary nature of the technology is linked to its potential to change the industry. Therefore, if we extract the part of the sentence that states \"The technology might change the industry,\" we are still capturing a part of the original meaning, which is the potential impact of the technology on the industry. The word \"might\" indicates that this is a possibility, not a certainty. Thus, the inference that \"The technology might change the industry\" is a reasonable one to make from the original statement, as it retains the possibility of the technology having an impact on the industry without necessarily asserting that it will be revolutionary.\n\nAnswer: yes",
