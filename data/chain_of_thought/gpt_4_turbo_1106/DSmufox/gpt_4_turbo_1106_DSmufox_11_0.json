Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\n\nThe first statement tells us that the flug is definitely not zimmed. The second statement presents a disjunction, meaning one or the other must be true. Since we know from the first statement that the flug is not zimmed, the only other option from the second statement must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, if the flug is not zimmed, it must be the case that the flug is blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
