This means that the first part of Statement 2 is false. Since Statement 2 presents an \"either/or\" scenario (which is an inclusive or), and we know that the first part (Lupped(Smip)) is false, the only way for Statement 2 to be true is if the second part (Shripped(Smip)) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
