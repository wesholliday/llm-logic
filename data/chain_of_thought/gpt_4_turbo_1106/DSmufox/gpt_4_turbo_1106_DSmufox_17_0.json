Therefore, the only way for Statement 2 to be true (since it is an either/or statement and one option is false) is if the flob is skizzled.\n\nSo, from the negation of the first part of the disjunction (\u00acMovated(flob)) and the truth of the disjunction itself (Movated(flob) \u2228 Skizzled(flob)), we can infer that the second part of the disjunction must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
