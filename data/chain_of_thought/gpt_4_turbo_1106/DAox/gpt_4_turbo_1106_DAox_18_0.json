We also have the conditional statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n\nFrom the conditional statement, we know that being plooked is a sufficient condition for the shank to be nugged. However, we do not know if being plooked is a necessary condition for the shank to be nugged. In other words, the shank being nugged might not depend solely on it being plooked; it could be nugged for other reasons as well.\n\nSince we only know that the shank was not plooked, we cannot infer from this information alone whether the shank was nugged or not. The absence of the condition (the shank being plooked) does not necessarily imply the absence of the outcome (the shank being nugged), unless we have a statement that directly says \"If and only if the shank is plooked, it is nugged,\" which we do not have.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The shank was not nugged\" based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
