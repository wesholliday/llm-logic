We also know that \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" This is a conditional statement that can be represented as: If P, then Q (where P is \"the sneg was crampled\" and Q is \"the sneg sproted the frink\").\n\nFrom the information given, we can infer the following:\n\n- Since the sneg was not crampled (not P), we cannot directly infer whether the sneg sproted the frink (Q) or not because the conditional statement only specifies what happens if the sneg was crampled. It does not provide information about what happens if the sneg was not crampled.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\" based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
