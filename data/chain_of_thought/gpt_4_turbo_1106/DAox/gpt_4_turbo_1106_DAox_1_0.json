We also know that \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement that can be represented as \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and Q is \"the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nSince we know that P is false (the flugel was not blimmed), we cannot directly infer the truth value of Q (the flugel was zargled) from this conditional alone. The falsity of P does not affect the truth value of Q in standard logic; Q could still be true or false regardless of P being false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The flugel was not zargled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
