We have the statement \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n2. We also have a conditional statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n\nThe conditional statement establishes a relationship between \"snurgling\" and \"crinking.\" It tells us that \"snurgling\" is a sufficient condition for \"crinking.\" In other words, if \"snurgling\" happens, then \"crinking\" must also happen. However, it does not tell us that \"snurgling\" is a necessary condition for \"crinking.\" That is, \"crinking\" could happen for reasons other than \"snurgling.\"\n\nSince we know that \"The fribble was not snurgled,\" we cannot use the conditional statement to conclude anything about \"crinking\" because the condition for \"crinking\" to happen (i.e., \"snurgling\") was not met. The absence of \"snurgling\" does not provide us with information about whether \"crinking\" did or did not occur.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The fribble did not crink.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
