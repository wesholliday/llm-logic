(S \u2192 M)\n\nWe want to know if from these two statements we can infer that 'The flob was not movated' (Not-M).\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement that can be read as \"If S then M\". This means that if the flob was skizzled (S), then it necessarily movated (M). However, it does not state that if the flob was not skizzled (Not-S), then it did not movate (Not-M). The absence of the condition (the flob being skizzled) does not necessarily imply the absence of the result (the flob movating).\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer that 'The flob was not movated' just because 'The flob was not skizzled'. There could be other reasons or conditions under which the flob could movate that are not mentioned in the statements provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
