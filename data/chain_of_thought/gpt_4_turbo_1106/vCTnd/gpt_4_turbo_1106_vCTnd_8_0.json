            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement: \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively.\" We can represent this as: P \u2192 \u00acQ (where P is \"the issue was addressed\" and Q is \"the issue was addressed effectively\").\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed.\" We can represent this as: Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nFor an argument to be valid, the conclusion must be a logical consequence of the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThe premise P \u2192 \u00acQ states that if P is true, then Q must be false. The conclusion Q \u2192 \u00acP states that if Q is true, then P must be false. These two statements are contrapositives of each other, and in classical logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nBased on this analysis, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and in logic, a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes",
