            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement: \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.\" This can be symbolized as P \u2192 \u00acQ, where P is \"Ben studied\" and Q is \"Ben studied diligently,\" and \u00acQ is \"Ben did not study diligently.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\" This can be symbolized as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nFor an argument to be valid, the conclusion must follow logically from the premise. In this case, the premise states that if P is true, then Q is false. The conclusion states that if Q is true, then P is false.\n\nThis is a form of contraposition, which is a valid argument form. In contraposition, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is Q \u2192 \u00acP, which is exactly the conclusion we have here.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
