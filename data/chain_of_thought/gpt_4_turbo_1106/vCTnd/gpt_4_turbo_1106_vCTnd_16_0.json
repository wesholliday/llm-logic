            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement: \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well.\" This can be symbolized as P \u2192 \u00acQ, where P is \"the job was completed\" and Q is \"the job was completed well.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\" This can be symbolized as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the conclusion must be a logical consequence of the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nThe premise states that if P is true, then Q must be false. The conclusion states that if Q is true, then P must be false. This is the contrapositive of the premise, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement has the same truth value as the statement itself.\n\nTherefore, since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
