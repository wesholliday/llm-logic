            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement: \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\" This can be symbolized as P \u2192 \u00acQ, where P is \"the room was cleaned\" and Q is \"the room was cleaned thoroughly,\" and \u00acQ is \"the room was not cleaned thoroughly.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\" This can be symbolized as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nFor an argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises. In this case, we need to determine if the truth of P \u2192 \u00acQ necessarily leads to the truth of Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nThe premise states that if the room was cleaned at all (even if not thoroughly), then it was not cleaned thoroughly. The conclusion states that if the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned at all. This is a form of contraposition, where the implication is reversed and the terms are negated.\n\nIn classical logic, the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive of P \u2192 \u00acQ is Q \u2192 \u00acP, which is exactly the conclusion we have here.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and in classical logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
