            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nThe premise is a conditional statement: \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly.\" This can be symbolized as P \u2192 \u00acQ, where P is \"the room was tidied\" and Q is \"the room was tidied thoroughly.\"\n\nThe conclusion is another conditional statement: \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\" This can be symbolized as Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nFor an argument to be valid, the conclusion must follow logically from the premise. In this case, the premise states that if P happens, then Q does not happen. The conclusion states that if Q happens, then P does not happen.\n\nThe argument is attempting to affirm the consequent of the premise as the antecedent of the conclusion and negate the antecedent of the premise as the consequent of the conclusion. This is a form of contraposition, which is a valid form of argument. In contraposition, the implication P \u2192 \u00acQ is logically equivalent to Q \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise by the rule of contraposition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
