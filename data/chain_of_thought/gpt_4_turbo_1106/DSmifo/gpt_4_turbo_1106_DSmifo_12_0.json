The second statement presents two exclusive possibilities: either the jacket is hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the jacket is not in the closet, and the second statement says that if it's not in the closet it must be over the chair, we can infer that if the jacket is indeed not in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
