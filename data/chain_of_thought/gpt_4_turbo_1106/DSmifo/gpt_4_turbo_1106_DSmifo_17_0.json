The second statement presents a dichotomy: the scarf is either on the coat rack or in the backpack.\n\nIf the scarf might not be on the coat rack, and these are the only two options presented, then it must be the case that the scarf is in the backpack if it is not on the coat rack.\n\nTherefore, given that the scarf might not be on the coat rack, and the only other option provided is that it is in the backpack, we can infer that the scarf is in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
