Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\n\nThe first statement suggests that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist, but it does not confirm that the watch is definitely not on his wrist. It leaves open other possibilities.\n\nThe second statement presents a dichotomy: the watch is either on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser. There are no other options presented.\n\nIf we combine the two statements, we can infer that if the watch is definitely not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser, because those are the only two options given.\n\nHowever, since the first statement only suggests a possibility and does not confirm that the watch is not on his wrist, we cannot definitively conclude that the watch is charging on the dresser based on the information provided. There is still a possibility that the watch is on his wrist.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: no",
