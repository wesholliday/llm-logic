The second statement presents two possibilities: either the notebook is on the nightstand or it is in the drawer. Since the first statement allows for the possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, and the second statement says that if it's not on the nightstand it must be in the drawer, we can infer that if the notebook is indeed not on the nightstand, it must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
