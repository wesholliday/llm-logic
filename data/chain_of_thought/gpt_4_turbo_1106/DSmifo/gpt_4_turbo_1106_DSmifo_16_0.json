Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\n\nThe second statement presents a dichotomy: the pen is either on the desk or in the bag. There are no other options presented.\n\nThe first statement introduces the possibility that the pen is not on the desk. However, it does not confirm that the pen is definitely not on the desk; it only opens up the possibility.\n\nTo infer that the pen is in the bag, we would need to establish that the pen is definitely not on the desk. Since the first statement only suggests that the pen might not be on the desk, but does not confirm it, we cannot make a definitive inference that the pen is in the bag based solely on these two statements.\n\nTherefore, the answer to whether we can infer 'The pen is in my bag' from the given statements is:\n\nAnswer: no",
