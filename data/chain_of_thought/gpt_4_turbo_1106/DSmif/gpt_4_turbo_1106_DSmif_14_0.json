The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nThe first statement presents a dichotomy: the milk is either in one place or the other. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the milk being in the fridge but does not confirm that the milk is definitely not in the fridge. The use of \"might not be\" indicates a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nTo infer that the milk is on the counter, we would need a statement that definitively rules out the fridge as the location of the milk. Since the second statement does not provide this certainty, we cannot conclusively infer that the milk is on the counter based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
