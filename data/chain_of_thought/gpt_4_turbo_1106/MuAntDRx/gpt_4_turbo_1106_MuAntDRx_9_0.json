The use of \"or\" indicates that at least one of the conditions must be true, but it does not exclude the possibility that both could be true. The statement does not provide information that exclusively supports the conclusion that \"The blurble must be on blimple\" without the possibility of it being \"plonk.\" Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the blurble must be on blimple without additional information that rules out the possibility of the blurble being plonk.\n\nAnswer: no",
