It must be either \"flibbit floob\" or \"flibbit blimple.\" This is an inclusive or statement, meaning that one or both conditions could be true. However, we cannot infer that the wozzle must be \"flibbit blimple\" exclusively because the statement allows for the possibility that the wozzle could also be \"flibbit floob.\" To infer that the wozzle must be \"flibbit blimple,\" we would need additional information that rules out the possibility of the wozzle being \"flibbit floob.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
