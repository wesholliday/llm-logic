We are told it is not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\n3. If the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet, and these are the only two options presented, then the jacket must be in the other location mentioned.\n4. Therefore, the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
