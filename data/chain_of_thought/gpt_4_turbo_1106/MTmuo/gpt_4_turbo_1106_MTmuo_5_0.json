If the condition (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the result (Amy must have played tennis) must also be true.\n\nGiven that we know from the first statement that Amy did not play tennis, the only way the second statement can be true is if the condition (Jeff playing basketball) did not happen. If Jeff had played basketball, then Amy would have had to play tennis, which contradicts the information we have.\n\nTherefore, since Amy did not play tennis, Jeff could not have played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
