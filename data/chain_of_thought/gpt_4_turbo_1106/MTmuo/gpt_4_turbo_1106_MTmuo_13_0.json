If the antecedent (the car was red) is true, then the consequent (the truck must have been blue) must also be true.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know the consequent of the second statement (the truck must have been blue) is false. In a conditional statement, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, since the truck was not blue, the car could not have been red, because if the car were red, it would imply that the truck must have been blue, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
