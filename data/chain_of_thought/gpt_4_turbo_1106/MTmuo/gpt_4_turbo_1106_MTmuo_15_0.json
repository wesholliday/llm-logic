It's possible that she took some other mode of transportation.\n\n2. \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" is a conditional statement. If the condition (Sam took a plane) is true, then the result (Erin must have taken a train) must also be true.\n\nGiven that the first statement tells us that it is not true that Erin must have taken a train, we can infer that the condition that would require Erin to have taken a train (Sam taking a plane) did not occur.\n\nTherefore, since Erin did not necessarily take a train, it must be the case that Sam did not take a plane, because if Sam had taken a plane, then Erin would have had to take a train, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
