If the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) is true, then the consequent (the robot must have visited Jupiter) must also be true.\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the consequent of the second statement (the robot must have visited Jupiter) is false. In a conditional statement, if the consequent is false, then the antecedent must also be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, since the consequent (the robot must have visited Jupiter) is false, the antecedent (the alien visited Mars) must also be false to keep the conditional statement true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
