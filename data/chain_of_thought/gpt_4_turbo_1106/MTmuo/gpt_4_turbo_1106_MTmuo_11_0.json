The second statement tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have to be blueberry. Since we know from the first statement that the muffins were not blueberry, it follows that the condition for the cake being chocolate (which would require the muffins to be blueberry) was not met.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes",
