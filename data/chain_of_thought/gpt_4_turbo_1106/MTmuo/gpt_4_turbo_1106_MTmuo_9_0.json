            "content": "To solve this, let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" means that Mark buying the blue shirt is not a necessity. It doesn't rule out the possibility that he did buy it, but it's not a must.\n\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement. If the first part (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the second part (Mark must have bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nGiven that the first statement tells us that it's not a must for Mark to have bought the blue shirt, and the second statement tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt then it must be the case that Mark bought the blue shirt, we can infer that the condition for the second statement cannot be true because it would contradict the first statement.\n\nTherefore, since Mark must not have bought the blue shirt, and Lisa buying the red shirt would require that Mark must have bought the blue shirt, Lisa could not have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
