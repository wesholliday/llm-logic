            "content": "Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\" implies that Jen watching basketball is not a necessity. It doesn't necessarily mean she didn't watch it, but it's not a requirement.\n\n2. \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" is a conditional statement. If the condition (Tom watched football) is true, then the result (Jen must have watched basketball) is also true.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know that Jen watching basketball is not a must. Therefore, the second statement's result cannot be true because it contradicts the first statement. Since the result of the second statement (Jen must have watched basketball) cannot be true, the condition that leads to that result (Tom watched football) must also not be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
