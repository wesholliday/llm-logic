            "content": "Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest\" implies that the unicorn was not necessarily in the forest. It does not confirm whether the unicorn was there or not; it only negates the necessity of the unicorn's presence.\n\n2. \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest\" establishes a conditional relationship where the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nGiven these two statements, if we assume that the griffin was in the forest, then according to the second statement, the unicorn must have been in the forest. However, this contradicts the first statement, which negates the necessity of the unicorn's presence in the forest.\n\nTherefore, to maintain the truth of both statements, the assumption that the griffin was in the forest must be false. If the griffin had been in the forest, it would create a situation where the unicorn must have been in the forest, which is not the case.\n\nHence, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest to avoid contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
