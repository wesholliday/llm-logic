            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" presents two possibilities for the state of the document: it might be signed, or it might be notarized. The use of \"or\" in this context does not necessarily imply exclusivity; it simply presents options. Therefore, the possibility that the document might be notarized is indeed one of the options presented in the original statement. Inferring that \"The document might be notarized\" from the original statement is valid because it is one of the possibilities explicitly mentioned.\n\nAnswer: yes",
