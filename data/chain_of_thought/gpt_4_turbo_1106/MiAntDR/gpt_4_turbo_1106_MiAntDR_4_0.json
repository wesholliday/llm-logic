By stating that the meeting \"might be cancelled,\" we are acknowledging one of the two possibilities mentioned. Since the original statement allows for the possibility of cancellation, inferring that \"The meeting might be cancelled\" is consistent with the information provided. We are not asserting that the meeting is definitely cancelled, only that it is a possibility, which is in line with the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
