            "content": "Explanation: The original statement presents two possibilities for the status of the flight: it might be delayed, or it might be on time. Since these two possibilities cover the entire range of options for the flight's punctuality (assuming there are no other options like early arrival), we can infer that each individual possibility is indeed a possibility. Therefore, if the statement says \"The flight might be delayed or on time,\" it is implicitly stating that \"The flight might be on time\" is one of the two possible outcomes. Hence, we can infer that the flight being on time is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
