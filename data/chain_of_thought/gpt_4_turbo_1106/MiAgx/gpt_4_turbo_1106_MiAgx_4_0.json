            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence contains two separate clauses connected by 'and', each expressing a possibility:\n\n1. \"The flimble might be at wozzle wozzle\"\n2. \"The gribble might be in the snork wozzle\"\n\nThe use of \"might\" in both clauses indicates that there is a possibility for each of the two events to occur, but it does not guarantee that either event is actually happening. The sentence you're asking about is a rephrasing of the original, maintaining the same structure but slightly changing the wording:\n\n\"It might be that the flimble is at wozzle wozzle and the gribble is in the snork wozzle.\"\n\nThis rephrased sentence still expresses the same two possibilities, just in a different format. It does not assert that both events are definitely happening, but rather that there is a possibility for both to be true simultaneously. Therefore, the meaning of the rephrased sentence is logically equivalent to the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes",
