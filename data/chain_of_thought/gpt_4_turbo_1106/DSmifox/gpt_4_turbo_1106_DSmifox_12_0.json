If the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped. If the smip is lupped, then the condition of it being shripped is not necessarily true.\n\nGiven that the first statement does not confirm that the smip is not lupped, we cannot be certain that the smip must be shripped. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The smip is shripped\" based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
