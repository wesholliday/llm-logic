However, it does not confirm that the flug is definitely not zimmed.\n\n2. \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed\" presents a dichotomy, indicating that there are only two possibilities: the flug is either zimmed or blummed.\n\nGiven these two statements, if the flug might not be zimmed, and the only other option presented is that it is blummed, then if the flug is indeed not zimmed, it must be blummed to satisfy the second statement.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that if the flug is not zimmed, then it must be blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
