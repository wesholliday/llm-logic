If the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled to satisfy this statement.\n\nSince the first statement does not confirm that the fribble is not crinked, we cannot be certain that the fribble is snurgled based solely on these two statements. The fribble might be crinked, or it might not be, and if it is not, then it would have to be snurgled. However, without confirmation that the fribble is definitely not crinked, we cannot infer with certainty that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no",
