However, it does not confirm that the splat is definitely not quanked.\n\n2. \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\" presents a dichotomy, meaning the splat has to be in one of the two states: it is either quanked or morphed.\n\nGiven these two statements, if we consider the possibility that the splat is not quanked (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only other option available is that the splat is morphed.\n\nTherefore, if the splat is not quanked, it must be morphed to satisfy the condition presented in the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
