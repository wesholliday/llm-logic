This means that Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\n\n2. \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\" presents a disjunction, suggesting that one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden, and the second statement offers only two possibilities (Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside), we can infer that since it cannot be the case that Fido must be in the garden, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
