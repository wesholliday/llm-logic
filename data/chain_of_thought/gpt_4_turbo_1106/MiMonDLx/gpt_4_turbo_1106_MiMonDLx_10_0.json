            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The snork might be plonk\" suggests that there is a possibility of the snork being plonk. When we consider the statement \"The snork might be plonk or wobble,\" we are introducing an additional option (wobble) to the original possibility. Since the original statement allows for the possibility of being plonk, adding another option (wobble) does not negate the original possibility; it simply expands it. Therefore, if the snork might be plonk, it is also true that the snork might be plonk or it might be something else, in this case, wobble. The inclusion of an additional possibility (wobble) does not exclude the original possibility (plonk) and thus the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
