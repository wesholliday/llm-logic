            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The zibber might be froodle\" suggests that there is a possibility of the zibber being froodle. When we add an additional option to a possibility statement, such as \"or on wibble,\" we are expanding the range of possibilities. If the zibber might be froodle, then it is also true that the zibber might be froodle or something else, because the original possibility (froodle) is included within the expanded set of possibilities (froodle or on wibble). Therefore, the inference that \"The zibber might be froodle or on wibble\" is a valid one, as it does not contradict the original statement and only adds another option that could also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
