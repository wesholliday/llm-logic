It could be, but it's not a must.\n\n2. \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked\" presents two possibilities: the fribble is either snurgled or it must be crinked.\n\nGiven that the first statement tells us that the fribble does not have to be crinked, and the second statement gives us a choice between the fribble being snurgled or it having to be crinked, we can infer that since it must not be crinked, the only remaining option from the second statement is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
