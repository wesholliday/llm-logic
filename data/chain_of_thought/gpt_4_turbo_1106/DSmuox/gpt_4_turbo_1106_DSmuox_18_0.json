It could be, but it's not a must.\n\n2. \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged\" presents two possibilities: the shank is either plooked or it must be nugged.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the necessity of the shank being nugged, and the second statement offers a disjunction where one option is that the shank must be nugged, we can infer that since it's not the case that the shank must be nugged, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
