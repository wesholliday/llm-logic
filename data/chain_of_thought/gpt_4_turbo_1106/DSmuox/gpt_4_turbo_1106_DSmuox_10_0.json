It could be, but it's not a must.\n\n2. \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled\" presents two possibilities: the wug is either sproinged or it must be garpled.\n\nSince the first statement negates the necessity of the wug being garpled, and the second statement offers a disjunction where one of the options is that the wug must be garpled, we can conclude that the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, given that the wug cannot \"must be garpled,\" it must be the case that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
