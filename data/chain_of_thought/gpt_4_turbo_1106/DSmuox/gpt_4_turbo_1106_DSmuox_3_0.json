It could be, but it's not a must.\n\n2. \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked\" presents two possibilities: the splat is either morphed or it must be quanked.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the necessity of the splat being quanked, and the second statement offers a dichotomy where one option is that the splat must be quanked, we can infer that since it's not a must for the splat to be quanked, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
