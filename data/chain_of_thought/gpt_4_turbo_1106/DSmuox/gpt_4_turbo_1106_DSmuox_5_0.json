This does not necessarily mean that the zinger cannot be smoogled, just that it is not a necessity.\n\n2. \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled\" presents two possibilities: the zinger is either fraggled or it must be smoogled.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the necessity of the zinger being smoogled, and the second statement offers a dichotomy where if the zinger is not smoogled, it must be the other option (fraggled), we can infer that the zinger must be fraggled because the necessity of being smoogled has been ruled out.\n\nAnswer: yes",
