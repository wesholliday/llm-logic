This could mean that the wug might be bimmed or might not be bimmed, but it is not a requirement.\n\n2. \"Either the wug is flooped or it must be bimmed\" is a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. Since we know from the first statement that it is not the case that the wug must be bimmed, this condition is false.\n\n3. Given that in a disjunction if one condition is false the other must be true for the disjunction to hold, and since we have established that \"the wug must be bimmed\" is false, the other condition \"the wug is flooped\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, from these two statements, we can infer that the wug is flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
