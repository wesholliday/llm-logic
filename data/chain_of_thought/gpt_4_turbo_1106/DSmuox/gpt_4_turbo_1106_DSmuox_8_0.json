This is a negation of the necessity for the sprocket to be daggled.\n\n2. \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled\" is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true: either the sprocket is cranked, or it must be daggled.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know that it is not necessary for the sprocket to be daggled. Therefore, the only other option from the second statement that can be true, to satisfy the disjunction, is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nSince the necessity of the sprocket being daggled is negated, and the disjunction requires at least one of the conditions to be true, the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
