It could be, but it's not a must.\n\n2. \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped\" is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the conditions must be true: either the grommet is sploffed, or it must be plopped.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the necessity of the grommet being plopped, and the second statement offers a choice between the grommet being sploffed or it must be plopped, the negation of the necessity of plopping the grommet leaves us with the only other option from the disjunction, which is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
