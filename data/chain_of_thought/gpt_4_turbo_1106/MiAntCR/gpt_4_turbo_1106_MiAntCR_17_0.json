It does not provide any information about the accuracy of the report. The concept of accuracy is entirely separate from the timing of the submission. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the accuracy of the report based on the given statement. To infer that the report might be accurate and be submitted by noon would require additional information that is not present in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
