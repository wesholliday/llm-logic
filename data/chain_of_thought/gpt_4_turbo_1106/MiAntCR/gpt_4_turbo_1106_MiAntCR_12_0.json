However, this statement does not provide any information about the timeline or the completion date of the project.\n\nTo infer that \"The project might be completed by Friday and be under budget\" from the original statement, we would need additional information that suggests the project is also on track to be completed by Friday. Since the original statement does not mention anything about the project's completion date, we cannot make an inference about the timing of the project's completion based solely on the information about the budget.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"The project might be under budget,\" we cannot infer that \"The project might be completed by Friday and be under budget\" without additional information about the project's timeline.\n\nAnswer: no",
