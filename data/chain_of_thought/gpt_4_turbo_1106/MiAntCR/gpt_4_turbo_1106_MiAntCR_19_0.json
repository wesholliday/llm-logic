However, this statement does not provide any information about the method or medium through which the application is completed. The addition of \"might be completed online\" introduces a new, unrelated characteristic that is not supported by the original statement. Without additional context or information that links the application's inclusion of references to the method of completion, we cannot infer that the application can be completed online based solely on the information that it might include references.\n\nAnswer: no",
