            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package might be signed for\" implies that there is a possibility that the package will be signed for upon delivery. However, this statement does not specify when the package will be delivered or signed for. It only indicates that at some point, there is a possibility of the package being signed for.\n\nThe inference \"The package might be delivered today and signed for\" adds an additional detail about the timing of the delivery, specifically that it might happen today. Since the original statement does not provide any information about the timing of the delivery, we cannot infer that the package might be delivered today based solely on the original statement.\n\nTherefore, without additional context or information indicating that the package is expected to be delivered today, we cannot make the inference that the package might be delivered today and signed for based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
