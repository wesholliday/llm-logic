            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The event must have been formal\" implies that the event had a high level of formality. If an event is described as formal, it typically means that it adheres to a strict dress code and etiquette, which is more stringent than a semi-formal event. A semi-formal event is less formal than a formal event but still requires a certain level of dressiness and decorum.\n\nWhen we consider the statement \"The event must have been semi-formal or formal,\" we are looking at a range that includes both semi-formal and formal events. Since a formal event is already at the higher end of formality, it is included within the broader category that encompasses both semi-formal and formal events. Therefore, if an event is known to be formal, it is also accurate to say that it falls within the category of being either semi-formal or formal, because the formal category is a subset of the combined semi-formal or formal category.\n\nAnswer: yes",
