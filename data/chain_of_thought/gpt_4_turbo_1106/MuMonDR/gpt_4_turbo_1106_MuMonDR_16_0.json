            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" implies a regular cleaning schedule that occurs every day. If a room is cleaned daily, it is being cleaned more frequently than if it were cleaned only upon request. Cleaning upon request suggests that the cleaning happens only when someone asks for it, which could be less frequent than daily.\n\nSince daily cleaning is a subset of cleaning upon request or daily (because \"upon request\" could be any frequency, including daily or less often), the original statement that the room is cleaned daily already satisfies the condition of being cleaned upon request or daily. Therefore, if we know the room is cleaned daily, it is also true that it would be cleaned if it were upon request or daily, because the daily schedule is more stringent than the upon request condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
