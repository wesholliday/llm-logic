            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" implies that the delivery of the package has already occurred, and it happened on the current day. The use of the past tense \"must have been delivered\" indicates that the action is completed. Therefore, the delivery is not something that is expected to happen in the future, but something that has already taken place.\n\nWhen we consider the second statement, \"The package must have been delivered tomorrow or today,\" it introduces a time frame that includes both the present day and the next day (tomorrow). However, since the original statement specifies that the delivery has already happened today, there is no need to include \"tomorrow\" as a possibility for the delivery time. The inclusion of \"tomorrow\" suggests that the delivery could still happen, which contradicts the certainty of the delivery having already occurred today.\n\nTherefore, based on the original statement, we cannot infer that the package could have been delivered tomorrow because the delivery has already been completed today.\n\nAnswer: no",
