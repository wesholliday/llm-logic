            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out\" asserts with certainty that the concert was sold out. The second statement \"The concert must have been postponed or sold out\" presents two possibilities for the concert's status: it was either postponed or sold out. Since being sold out is one of the possibilities included in the second statement, and the first statement confirms that the concert was indeed sold out, the first statement logically fits within the scope of the second. Therefore, if the concert was sold out, it is also true that it was either postponed or sold out, because the sold-out condition is met.\n\nAnswer: yes",
