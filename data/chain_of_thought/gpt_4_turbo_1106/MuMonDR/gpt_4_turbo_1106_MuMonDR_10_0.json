            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document must have been signed\" asserts that the document has definitely been signed. The logical structure of the statement \"The document must have been notarized or signed\" suggests that the document must have undergone at least one of two processes: it must have been either notarized or signed. Since we already know from the first statement that the document has been signed, it fulfills the condition of being either notarized or signed. The addition of \"notarized\" as an option does not negate the truth of the document being signed; it simply presents an additional condition that could also satisfy the requirement. Therefore, if the document has been signed, it automatically satisfies the condition of being \"notarized or signed,\" even if we don't know whether it has been notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes",
