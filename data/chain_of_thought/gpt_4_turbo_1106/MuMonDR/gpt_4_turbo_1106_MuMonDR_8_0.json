            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays\" explicitly states that the restaurant was not open at all on Mondays. If the restaurant was closed on Mondays, it means there were no hours during which it was open on that day of the week. Therefore, saying the restaurant was \"open for limited hours or closed on Mondays\" includes the possibility that the restaurant was open for a reduced number of hours. However, since we already know from the initial statement that the restaurant was closed the entire day, there is no need to consider the option of it being open for limited hours on Mondays. The inference that the restaurant was either open for limited hours or closed on Mondays is broader than the information given, which definitively states that the restaurant was closed on Mondays.\n\nAnswer: yes",
