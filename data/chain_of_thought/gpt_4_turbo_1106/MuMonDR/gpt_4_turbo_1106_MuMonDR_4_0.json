            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM\" asserts with certainty that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM. The second statement, \"The meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM,\" presents two possibilities: either the meeting was cancelled or it was scheduled for 2 PM. Since the first statement confirms that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM, it is also true that the meeting was either cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM, because the latter includes the possibility that was confirmed by the first statement. The second statement is a broader claim that encompasses the specific claim made in the first statement. Therefore, if the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true, because it includes the first as one of its possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
