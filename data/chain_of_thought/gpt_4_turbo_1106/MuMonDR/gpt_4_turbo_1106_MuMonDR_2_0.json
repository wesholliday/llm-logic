            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The book must be on the shelf\" asserts with certainty that the location of the book is on the shelf. If the book is on the shelf, then it is already in a specific location. The second statement, \"The book must be in the library or on the shelf,\" presents two possibilities for the location of the book: it could either be in the library or on the shelf. Since being on the shelf does not exclude the possibility of the shelf being in the library, the book being on the shelf satisfies one of the conditions of the second statement. Therefore, if the first statement is true, the second statement is also true because the book's being on the shelf fulfills one of the two conditions without contradicting the other.\n\nAnswer: yes",
