            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The application must have been completed online\" specifies that the completion of the application occurred online. This statement does not allow for any other method of completion; it is exclusive to the online medium. If we were to infer that \"The application must have been completed in person or online,\" we would be adding an additional method (in person) that was not included in the original statement. Inference requires that the conclusion must logically follow from the premises without adding new information. Since the original statement does not include the possibility of in-person completion, we cannot infer that in-person completion was an option based on that statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
