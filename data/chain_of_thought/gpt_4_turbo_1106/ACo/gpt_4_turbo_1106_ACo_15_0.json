Erin took a train.\n\nThe second statement is a conditional:\n2. If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n\nThe second statement establishes a condition where Erin's taking a train is a consequence of Sam taking a plane. However, it does not state that if Erin took a train, then Sam must have taken a plane. The condition is one-way; it does not work in reverse. Therefore, knowing that Erin took a train does not allow us to infer that Sam took a plane. Sam taking a plane is a sufficient condition for Erin to take a train, but it is not a necessary condition.\n\nAnswer: no",
