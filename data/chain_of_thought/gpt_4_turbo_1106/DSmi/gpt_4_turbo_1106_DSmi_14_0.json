The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\n\nThe first statement presents a dichotomy: the milk is either on the counter or in the fridge. There are no other options presented.\n\nThe second statement introduces a possibility that the milk is not in the fridge. However, it does not confirm that the milk is definitely not in the fridge; it only suggests that it's a possibility.\n\nTo infer that the milk is on the counter with certainty, we would need a definitive statement that the milk is not in the fridge. Since the second statement only suggests a possibility and does not confirm the absence of the milk from the fridge, we cannot conclusively infer that the milk is on the counter based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
