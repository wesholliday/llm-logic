Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n2. The remote control might not be hiding under the couch.\n\nThe first statement presents a disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where there are two possibilities for the location of the remote control. The second statement introduces uncertainty about the second possibility (it \"might not\" be under the couch), but it does not eliminate this possibility entirely.\n\nSince the second statement does not confirm that the remote control is definitely not under the couch, we cannot conclude with certainty that the remote control must be on the coffee table. The use of \"might not\" indicates a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot infer that the remote control is on the coffee table based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
