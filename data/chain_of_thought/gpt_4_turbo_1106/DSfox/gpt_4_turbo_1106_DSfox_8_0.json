We are also told that \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the sprocket cannot be daggled. The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where there are two possibilities: the sprocket is either daggled or cranked.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the sprocket is not daggled, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
