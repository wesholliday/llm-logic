We are also told \"Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.\"\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement), which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. Since we know from statement 1 that the first condition (\"the shank is nugged\") is false, the only way for the disjunction in statement 2 to be true is if the second condition (\"it is plooked\") is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
