We also have the statement \"Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged.\"\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the wug cannot be garpled. Therefore, the only other option presented in statement 2 must be true if the statement is to hold. Since the wug cannot be garpled, the only remaining possibility from the given options is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
