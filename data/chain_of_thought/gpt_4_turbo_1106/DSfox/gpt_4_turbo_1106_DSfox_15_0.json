We are also given a second statement \"Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know for certain that \"The dreb is not spened\" is true.\n\nThe second statement presents a logical disjunction, which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true. Since we know that \"The dreb is spened\" is false (from the first statement), the only other possibility within the disjunction for the second statement to hold true is that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
