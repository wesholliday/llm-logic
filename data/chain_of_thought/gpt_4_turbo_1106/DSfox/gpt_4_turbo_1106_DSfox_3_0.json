We are also told \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the splat cannot be quanked. The second statement presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where two possibilities are presented: the splat is either quanked or morphed.\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the splat is not quanked, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the splat must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
