We are also told \"Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled.\"\n\nFrom statement 2, we have a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement), which means that at least one of the conditions must be true. Since we know from statement 1 that the flob is not movated, the only other option from the disjunction in statement 2 that can be true is that \"the flob is skizzled.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
