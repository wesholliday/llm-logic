We are also told \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.\"\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the condition \"the whiffle is tinked\" is false. Statement 2 presents a logical disjunction (an \"either/or\" scenario) where at least one of the conditions must be true. Since we know the first condition \"the whiffle is tinked\" is false, the only way for the disjunction in statement 2 to be true is if the second condition \"the whiffle is shanked\" is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The whiffle is shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
