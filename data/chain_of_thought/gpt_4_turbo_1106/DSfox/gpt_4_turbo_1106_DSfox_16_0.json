We are also given a second statement \"Either the sneg is sproted or it is crampled.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the sneg cannot be sproted. The second statement presents a dichotomy: the sneg must be either sproted or crampled. Since we know from the first statement that the sneg is not sproted, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
