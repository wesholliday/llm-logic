(Therefore, Joe went to the park.)\n\nThis form of argument is invalid because the truth of the consequent (Q) does not necessarily imply the truth of the antecedent (P). It is possible that Lucy could have gone to the zoo for a reason other than Joe going to the park. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
