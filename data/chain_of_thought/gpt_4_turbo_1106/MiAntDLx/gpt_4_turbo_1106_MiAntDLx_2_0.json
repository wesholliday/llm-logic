            "content": "Explanation: The original sentence presents two possibilities for the location of 'the fribble': it might be on 'the blurble' or it might be in 'the wobble'. The use of the word 'might' indicates uncertainty or possibility, not certainty. When we consider the phrase 'The fribble might be on the blurble', we are looking at one of the two possibilities mentioned in the original sentence. Since the original sentence states that being on the blurble is one possible location for the fribble, we can infer that this is a possibility without contradicting the information given.\n\nAnswer: yes",
