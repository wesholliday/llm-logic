Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the watch is definitely not on his wrist. Statement 2 presents us with two possibilities: the watch is either charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist. Since we have already established from statement 1 that it cannot be on his wrist, the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
