Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\n\nFrom statement 1, we understand that the missing puzzle piece is definitely not blending in on the floor.\n\nStatement 2 presents a dichotomy: the piece is either in the box or blending in on the floor.\n\nSince we know from statement 1 that it is not blending in on the floor, the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
