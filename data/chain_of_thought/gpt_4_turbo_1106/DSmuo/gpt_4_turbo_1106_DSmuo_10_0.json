Since we know from the first statement that it cannot be under the bed, the only remaining possibility from this disjunction is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, given that the sock must be in one of these two places and it is not under the bed, it follows that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
