This means Fido might not be in the garden.\n\n2. \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" presents a disjunction, suggesting that one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the necessity of Fido being in the garden, and the second statement offers a choice between Fido being inside or being in the garden, we can infer that if Fido is not necessarily in the garden, then the only other option presented is that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
