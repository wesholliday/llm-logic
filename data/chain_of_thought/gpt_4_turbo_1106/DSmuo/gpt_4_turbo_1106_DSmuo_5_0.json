Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that the cookies are definitely not required to be hidden in the pantry. This means that the second part of statement 2, which says \"they must be hidden in the pantry,\" is not true.\n\nSince statement 2 presents two options and we know that one of them (the cookies must be hidden in the pantry) is not true, the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
