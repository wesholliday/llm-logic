            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The application must have been completed online and included references\" is a compound statement that includes two separate requirements for the application:\n\n1. The application must have been completed online.\n2. The application included references.\n\nThe use of \"and\" in the sentence indicates that both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, then each individual part of the compound statement must also be true. This means that if the application met the criteria of the original statement, it necessarily was completed online. Hence, we can infer that \"The application must have been completed online\" is a true statement based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
