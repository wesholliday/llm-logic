            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM\" is a compound statement consisting of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and.\" The first part is \"The concert must have been sold out,\" and the second part is \"started at 8 PM.\" When a compound statement is made using \"and,\" it means that both parts of the statement are being asserted together. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, then each individual part of the compound statement must also be true. Thus, from the given statement, we can infer that the concert was sold out, because that is one of the two assertions being made.\n\nAnswer: yes",
