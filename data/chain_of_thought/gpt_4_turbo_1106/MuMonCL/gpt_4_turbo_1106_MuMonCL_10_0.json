            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed and notarized\" implies that two actions were required: signing and notarizing. Notarization typically involves a notary public who witnesses the signing of a document and verifies the identity of the signers. Therefore, for a document to be notarized, it must first be signed. The signing is a prerequisite for notarization. Hence, if the document has been notarized, it must have been signed as part of the notarization process.\n\nAnswer: yes",
