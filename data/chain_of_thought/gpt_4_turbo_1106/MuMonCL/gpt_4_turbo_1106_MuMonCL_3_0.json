            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs\" is a compound statement consisting of two parts joined by the conjunction \"and.\" The first part of the statement is \"The car must have been in the garage,\" and the second part is \"needed repairs.\" The use of \"and\" indicates that both conditions are believed to be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is accepted as true, then it is valid to infer that each individual part of the compound statement is also true. Thus, from the given statement, we can infer that \"The car must have been in the garage\" is a true statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
