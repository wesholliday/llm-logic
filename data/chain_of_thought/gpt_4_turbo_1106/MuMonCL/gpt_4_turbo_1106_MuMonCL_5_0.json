            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for\" contains two assertions: 1) the package was delivered today, and 2) the package was signed for. The conjunction \"and\" indicates that both conditions are believed to be true. If we are to infer \"The package must have been delivered today\" from the original statement, we are considering only the first part of the original assertion. Since the original statement claims that the package was delivered today as part of its overall claim, it logically follows that the package must have been delivered today, even if we do not consider whether it was signed for. Therefore, the inference that \"The package must have been delivered today\" is a valid one based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
