The contrapositive of this statement, which is logically equivalent, would be \"If Q, then not P.\" This means that if the twonk was varnished, then it could not have been plinked.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" is a valid contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
