To infer the contrapositive, which is logically equivalent to the original statement, we would negate both conditions and swap them. The contrapositive of the original statement would be: If the flugel was not not zargled (which simplifies to zargled), then the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" is the contrapositive of the original statement and is logically equivalent to it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
