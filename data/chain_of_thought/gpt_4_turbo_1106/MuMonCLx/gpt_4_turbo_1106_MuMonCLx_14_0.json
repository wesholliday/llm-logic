            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The zooble must be zibber for a blimple and wump\" suggests that there are two conditions (a blimple and a wump) for which the zooble must be zibber. The statement you're asking about, \"The zooble must be zibber for a blimple,\" only includes one of those conditions (a blimple). Since the original statement asserts that the zooble must be zibber for both a blimple and a wump, it logically follows that the zooble must also be zibber for a blimple alone, because being zibber for both a blimple and a wump includes the condition of being zibber for a blimple by itself.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the zooble must be zibber for both a blimple and a wump, it must also be zibber for a blimple, even without additional information about the wump.\n\nAnswer: yes",
