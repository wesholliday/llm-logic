The inverse of the original statement, \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled,\" is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement only tells us about the situation where the wug is sproinged, not about situations where it is not sproinged.\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we cannot infer that if the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled. This is because the original statement does not address the truth value of \"garpled\" when \"sproinged\" is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
