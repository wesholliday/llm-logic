The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" The contrapositive of this statement is \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\" Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can use it to make an inference.\n\nGiven the second statement, \"The splat did not quank,\" we can apply the contrapositive to infer that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
