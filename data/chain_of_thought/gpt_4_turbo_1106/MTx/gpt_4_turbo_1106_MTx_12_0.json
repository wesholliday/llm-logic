This can be written as P \u2192 Q.\n2. The smip did not lup the zoint (\u00acQ).\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that the smip was not shripped (\u00acP).\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that if P happens, then Q must happen. However, we are told in the second statement that Q did not happen (\u00acQ).\n\nIn logical terms, if P \u2192 Q is true, and \u00acQ is true, then P must be false (\u00acP). This is because if P were true, then Q would also have to be true, but we know that Q is not true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip was not shripped (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
