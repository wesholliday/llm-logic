The wug was not garpled (\u00acQ).\n\nWe want to know if we can infer that the wug was not sproinged (\u00acP).\n\nFrom the first statement, if P is true, then Q must also be true. However, we know from the second statement that Q is false (the wug was not garpled). In a logical implication, if the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false, because true premises cannot lead to a false conclusion.\n\nTherefore, since Q is false, P must also be false to maintain the truth of the implication. This means that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
