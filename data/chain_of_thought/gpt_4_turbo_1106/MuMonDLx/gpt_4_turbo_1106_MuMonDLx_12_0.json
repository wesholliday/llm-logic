            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The floob must be zibble by glorp\" asserts that there is a necessity for the floob to be zibbled, and that this action must be done by glorp. The statement does not mention any alternative actions or agents that could zibble the floob.\n\nWhen we consider the expanded statement \"The floob must be zibble by glorp or wozzle flimble,\" we are introducing an additional possibility that the floob could either be zibbled by glorp or some other action (wozzle flimble) could take place. This expanded statement is logically inclusive, meaning that if the first part of the statement is true (the floob must be zibble by glorp), then the entire expanded statement is also true because the first part satisfies the condition of the \"or\" statement. An \"or\" statement in logic is true if at least one of its components is true.\n\nTherefore, if we accept the original statement as true, then the expanded statement must also be true because it includes the original statement as one of its possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
