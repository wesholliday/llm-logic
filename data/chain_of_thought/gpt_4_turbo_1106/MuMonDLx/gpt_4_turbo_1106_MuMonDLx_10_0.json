            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The frazzle must be froodle\" asserts that there is a necessity for the frazzle to be froodle. When we consider the logical relationship between this statement and the statement \"The frazzle must be froodle or wobble,\" we are essentially adding an additional option to the original statement without removing the original necessity. In other words, if the frazzle must be froodle, then it is also true that the frazzle must be froodle or something else, because the original condition (being froodle) is still met within the expanded set of possibilities (being froodle or wobble).\n\nIn logic, if a statement is true, then that statement OR another statement is also true, because the original truth condition is satisfied. The addition of \"or wobble\" does not negate the truth of the frazzle needing to be froodle; it simply allows for an additional possibility that does not conflict with the original statement.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"The frazzle must be froodle,\" we can infer that \"The frazzle must be froodle or wobble\" is also true, because the original condition of being froodle is included within the broader condition of being either froodle or wobble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
