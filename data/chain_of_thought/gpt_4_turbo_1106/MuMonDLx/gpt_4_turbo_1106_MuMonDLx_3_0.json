            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The zibber must be in the floob\" asserts that the location of the zibber is inside the floob. When we consider the expanded statement \"The zibber must be in the floob or on the floob,\" we are adding an additional possibility to the location of the zibber\u2014that it could also be on the floob. Since being \"in the floob\" does not exclude the possibility of being \"on the floob\" (in the sense that if it is in, it could also be considered as on in some contexts), the expanded statement is still true if the original statement is true. The original statement is a subset of the truth conditions of the expanded statement. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the expanded statement must also be true, because it includes the original condition as one of its possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes",
