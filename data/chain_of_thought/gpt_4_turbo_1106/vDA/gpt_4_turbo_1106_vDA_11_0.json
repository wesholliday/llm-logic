(If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.)\n2. Not P. (The cake was not chocolate.)\n3. Therefore, not Q. (Therefore, the muffins were not blueberry.)\n\nThis form of argument is invalid because the truth of the second premise (Not P) does not necessarily lead to the truth of the conclusion (Not Q). The first premise only states what happens if P is true; it does not state what happens if P is false. Therefore, the conclusion that the muffins were not blueberry does not logically follow from the premises given.\n\nAnswer: no",
