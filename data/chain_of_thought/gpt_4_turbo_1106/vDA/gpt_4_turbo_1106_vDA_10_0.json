Therefore, the cat was not outside. (Conclusion)\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\nThe first premise is a conditional statement (if P then Q). The second premise negates the antecedent of the conditional statement (not P). The conclusion negates the consequent of the conditional statement (not Q).\n\nThis form of argument is known as denying the antecedent, which is a logical fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of the conditional statement does not depend on the antecedent being true. In other words, just because the dog was not inside (the antecedent is false), it does not logically follow that the cat was not outside (the consequent is false). The cat could be outside for reasons unrelated to the location of the dog.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
