If the car was red, then the truck was blue. (If P, then Q)\n2. The car was not red. (Not P)\n3. Therefore, the truck was not blue. (Not Q)\n\nThis form of argument is invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. Just because the first condition (the car being red) is not met, it does not necessarily mean that the second condition (the truck being blue) cannot be met. The truck could be blue for reasons unrelated to the color of the car.\n\nAnswer: no",
