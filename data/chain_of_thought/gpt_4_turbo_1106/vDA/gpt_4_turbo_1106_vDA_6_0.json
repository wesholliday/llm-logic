If Sue chose pizza (P), then Bob chose pasta (Q). (P \u2192 Q)\n2. Sue did not choose pizza (\u00acP).\n3. Therefore, Bob did not choose pasta (\u00acQ).\n\nThe fallacy occurs because the first premise only specifies what happens if Sue does choose pizza; it does not provide information about what happens if Sue does not choose pizza. The conclusion that Bob did not choose pasta does not logically follow from the premises given. The argument would only be valid if the first premise were a biconditional, stating that Sue choosing pizza is both a necessary and sufficient condition for Bob choosing pasta. However, with the given premises, we cannot conclude anything about Bob's choice based on Sue not choosing pizza.\n\nAnswer: no",
