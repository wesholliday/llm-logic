            "content": "Explanation: The original statement contains two separate possibilities about the restaurant: it might be expensive, and it might be busy. These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive, meaning that both conditions could be true at the same time. The use of \"might\" indicates that each characteristic is a possibility, not a certainty. When we combine these two possibilities into one statement, we are suggesting that there is a chance that both characteristics apply to the restaurant simultaneously. Since the original statement does not rule out the possibility of the restaurant being both expensive and busy, it is reasonable to infer that there is a possibility that the restaurant might be both expensive and busy.\n\nAnswer: yes",
