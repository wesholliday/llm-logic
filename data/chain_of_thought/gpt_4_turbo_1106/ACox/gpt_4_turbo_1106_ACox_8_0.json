However, the conditional statement only tells us that if P happens, then Q will follow. It does not tell us that if Q happens, then P must have happened. There could be other reasons for Q to occur that do not involve P.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"The sprocket was daggled,\" we cannot definitively infer that \"The sprocket was cranked,\" because the daggling could have occurred without the cranking.\n\nAnswer: no",
