We also have the conditional statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nThe conditional statement establishes a relationship where cranking the sprocket is a sufficient condition for it to be daggled. However, it does not state that cranking is a necessary condition for the sprocket to be daggled. In other words, the sprocket being daggled could be due to cranking or some other action or cause.\n\nSince we only know that the sprocket was daggled, we cannot definitively conclude that it was cranked. There could be other reasons for the sprocket being daggled that are not specified in the information provided.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The sprocket was cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
