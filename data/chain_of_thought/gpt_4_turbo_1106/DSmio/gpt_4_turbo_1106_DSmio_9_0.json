Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\n\nFrom statement 2, we have two possibilities for the location of the missing puzzle piece: it's either in the box or blending in on the floor.\n\nStatement 1 suggests that there is a possibility that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\n\nHowever, statement 1 does not confirm that the puzzle piece is definitely not on the floor; it only opens up the possibility that it might not be there. Since it's not a definitive statement, we cannot conclude with certainty that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, based on these statements, we cannot infer with certainty that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: no",
