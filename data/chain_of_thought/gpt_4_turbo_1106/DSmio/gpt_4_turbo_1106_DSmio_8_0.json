This is an either/or scenario.\n\nFrom these two statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table because the first statement does not rule out the possibility of the remote control being under the couch; it only suggests that it might not be there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the remote control is on the coffee table based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
