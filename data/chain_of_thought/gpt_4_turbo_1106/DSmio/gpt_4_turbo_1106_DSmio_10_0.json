Since it's an either/or statement, if the sock is not in one location, it must be in the other.\n\nGiven that the first statement does not confirm the absence of the sock under the bed, we cannot be certain that it is in the laundry basket. The first statement allows for the possibility that the sock is not under the bed, but it does not rule it out completely.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the missing sock is in the laundry basket based solely on these two statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
