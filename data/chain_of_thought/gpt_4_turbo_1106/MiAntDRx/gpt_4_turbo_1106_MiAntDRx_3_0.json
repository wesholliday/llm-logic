            "content": "Explanation: The original statement presents two possibilities for the location of the fribble: it might be in the blurble or on the wumble. Since these are presented as alternatives, it is possible that the fribble is in one of these two locations. The statement \"The fribble might be on the wumble\" is a subset of the original statement, focusing on just one of the possibilities mentioned. Therefore, based on the original statement, it is indeed possible that the fribble might be on the wumble, as this is one of the options presented.\n\nAnswer: yes",
