It means that at least one of the following conditions must be true:\n   - The fleeg must be surned.\n   - The fleeg is bluttered.\n\n2. \"The fleeg might not be surned\" introduces a possibility that the fleeg is not surned. However, this does not confirm that the fleeg is definitely not surned; it only opens up the possibility.\n\nTo infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" with certainty, we would need a statement that definitively says \"The fleeg is not surned.\" Since we only have \"The fleeg might not be surned,\" we cannot make a definitive inference that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" because there is still a possibility that the fleeg is surned.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
