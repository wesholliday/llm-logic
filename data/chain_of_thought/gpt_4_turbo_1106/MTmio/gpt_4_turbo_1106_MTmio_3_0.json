It does not confirm whether the book is or isn't a mystery novel, just that it's possible it isn't.\n\nThe second statement establishes a conditional relationship: if James is the author, then the book is definitely a mystery novel.\n\nNow, if we know that the book might not be a mystery novel, and we also know that if James wrote it, it must be a mystery novel, we can infer that there is at least a possibility that James did not write the book. However, we cannot definitively conclude that James didn't write it because the first statement only presents a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot make a definitive inference that \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
