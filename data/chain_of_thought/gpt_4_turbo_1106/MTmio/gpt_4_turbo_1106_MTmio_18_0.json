            "content": "Let's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n1. \"The truck might not have been metal\" suggests that there is a possibility that the truck was not made of metal, but it does not confirm it.\n\n2. \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\" is a conditional statement. If the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the result (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\nNow, if we assume that the doll was plastic, according to the second statement, the truck must have been metal. However, this contradicts the possibility presented in the first statement that the truck might not have been metal.\n\nSince assuming the doll is plastic leads to a contradiction, we can infer that the doll was not plastic to maintain the consistency of both statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
