            "content": "To infer whether Lisa did not buy the red shirt, we need to examine the two statements given:\n\n1. \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" suggests that there is a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, but it does not confirm whether he did or did not.\n\n2. \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" is a conditional statement that sets a condition for Mark buying the blue shirt. It states that Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is contingent on Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nFrom the second statement, we understand that the only scenario in which Mark definitely bought the blue shirt is if Lisa bought the red shirt. However, since the first statement tells us that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, we can conclude that the condition for Mark's definite purchase (Lisa buying the red shirt) did not occur.\n\nTherefore, since Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, it follows that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, because if she had, Mark must have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the possibility that he might not have.\n\nAnswer: yes",
