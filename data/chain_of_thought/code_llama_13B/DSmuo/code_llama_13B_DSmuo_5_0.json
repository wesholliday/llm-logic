This is because the first statement rules out the possibility of the cookies being hidden in the pantry, and the second statement states that either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden there. Therefore, it is not possible for the cookies to be hidden in the pantry, so they must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
