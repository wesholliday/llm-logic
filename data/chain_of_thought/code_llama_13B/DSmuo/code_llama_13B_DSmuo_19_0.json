Therefore, the second statement can be rephrased as follows:\n\n* The watch is either charging on the dresser or not on his wrist.\n\nStep 3:\nSince the watch cannot be on his wrist, it must be charging on the dresser. Therefore, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
