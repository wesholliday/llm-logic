If the phone is not in the living room, then it must be ringing in the kitchen.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the phone is in the living room. This is because if the phone were not in the living room, then it would have to be ringing in the kitchen, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, the phone must be in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
