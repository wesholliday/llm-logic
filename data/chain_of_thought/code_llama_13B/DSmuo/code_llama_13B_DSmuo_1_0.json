The first statement only states that Fido must not be in the garden, which does not necessarily mean that Fido is not in the garden. The second statement only states that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden, but it does not provide any information about whether Fido is actually inside or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Fido is inside based on the given information and the second statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
