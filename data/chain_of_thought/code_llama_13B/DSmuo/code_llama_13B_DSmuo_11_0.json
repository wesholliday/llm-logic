If the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, then it must be in the driveway. This is because the second premise states that either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch. Since we know that the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, we can conclude that it must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
