The conclusion is \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. The argument is invalid because it is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. This occurs when we assume that if something happens (in this case, the muffins being blueberry), then another thing must happen (the cake not being chocolate). However, this assumption is not necessarily true and does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
