In this case, the statement is not a tautology because it depends on the value of Mary's attendance at the wedding. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding, but if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue could have been at the wedding.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the statement is a contradiction or not.\n\nA contradiction is a statement that is always false, regardless of the values assigned to its variables. In this case, the statement is not a contradiction because it depends on the value of Mary's attendance at the wedding. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding, but if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue could have been at the wedding.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the statement is a conditional or not.\n\nA conditional statement is a statement that has two parts: a hypothesis and a conclusion. In this case, the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is a conditional statement because it has two parts: \"Mary was at the wedding\" (the hypothesis) and \"Sue was not at the wedding\" (the conclusion).\n\nStep 6: Determine whether the statement is a biconditional or not.\n\nA biconditional statement is a statement that has two parts: a hypothesis and a conclusion, and the two parts are logically equivalent. In this case, the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is not a biconditional statement because it does not have two logically equivalent parts.\n\nStep 7: Determine whether the statement is a logical implication or not.\n\nA logical implication is a statement that has two parts: a hypothesis and a conclusion, and the conclusion follows from the hypothesis. In this case, the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is a logical implication because the conclusion (Sue was not at the wedding) follows from the hypothesis (Mary was at the wedding).\n\nStep 8: Determine whether the statement is a logical equivalence or not.\n\nA logical equivalence is a statement that has two parts: a hypothesis and a conclusion, and the two parts are logically equivalent. In this case, the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is not a logical equivalence because it does not have two logically equivalent parts.\n\nStep 9: Determine whether the statement is a logical contradiction or not.\n\nA logical contradiction is a statement that has two parts: a hypothesis and a conclusion, and the two parts are logically incompatible. In this case, the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is not a logical contradiction because it does not have two logically incompatible parts.\n\nStep 10: Determine whether the statement is a logical tautology or not.\n\nA logical tautology is a statement that is always true, regardless of the values assigned to its variables. In this case, the statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" is not a logical tautology because it depends on the value of Mary's attendance at the wedding. If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding, but if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue could have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
