The conclusion is \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. The argument is invalid because it is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. This occurs when we assume that just because something is true in one direction, it must also be true in the opposite direction. In this case, we are assuming that if the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside, but we have no evidence to support this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
