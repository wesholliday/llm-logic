            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the premise. The premise is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion. The conclusion is \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. To evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nFor example, suppose Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This would mean that Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark did not buy the blue shirt, which is consistent with the premise. However, this does not necessarily mean that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt. There could be other factors at play that affect whether or not Lisa buys the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" from the premise \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
