The premise is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n\nStep 2: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. The conclusion \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nStep 3: Reason through the argument. If we assume that the vampire is awake and the mummy is awake, then it is possible for both of them to be awake at the same time. Therefore, the conclusion \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake\" does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Write down your answer. Answer: no",
