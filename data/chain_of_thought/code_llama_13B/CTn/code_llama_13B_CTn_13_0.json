In this case, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise. The premise only states that if the car is red, then the truck is not blue, but it does not say anything about what happens when the truck is blue. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
