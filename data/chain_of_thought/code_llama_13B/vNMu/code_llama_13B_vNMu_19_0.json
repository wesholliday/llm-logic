This is a form of argument called \"affirming the negative.\"\n\nStep 2: Determine if the premise is logically valid. The premise states that it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser, which means that there are cases where the watch might not be charging on the dresser. This is a valid premise because it allows for the possibility of the watch not being charged on the dresser.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. The conclusion states that the watch might not be charging on the dresser, which means that there are cases where the watch is not charging on the dresser. This conclusion follows logically from the premise because it allows for the possibility of the watch not being charged on the dresser.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the argument is logically valid. The argument is logically valid because the premise and conclusion are both logically valid, and the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
