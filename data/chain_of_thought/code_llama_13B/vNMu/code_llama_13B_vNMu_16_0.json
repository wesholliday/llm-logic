This is a form of argument called a reductio ad absurdum, which means \"reduction to absurdity.\"\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the premise. The premise states that it's not the case that the pen must be in my bag. This means that there is at least one possibility where the pen is not in my bag.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion. The conclusion states that the pen might not be in my bag. This is a logical consequence of the premise, as it implies that there is at least one possibility where the pen is not in my bag.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is logically valid. Since the conclusion follows logically from the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
