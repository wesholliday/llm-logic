This is an example of a modus tollens argument, which is logically valid.\n\nStep 2: Check if the premise and conclusion are in agreement with each other. In this case, the premise states that it's not the case that the book must have been written by James, while the conclusion states that the book might not have been written by James. These two statements are logically consistent with each other, as they both suggest that the authorship of the book is uncertain.\n\nStep 3: Check if the argument form is valid. Modus tollens is a valid argument form, so this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
