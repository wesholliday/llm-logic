This is an example of a modus tollens argument, which is logically valid.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the premise and conclusion. The premise states that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, which means that there is at least one possibility that she did not buy the red shirt. The conclusion then follows that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, which is a logical implication of the premise.\n\nStep 3: Check for any logical fallacies or inconsistencies in the argument. There are none in this case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
