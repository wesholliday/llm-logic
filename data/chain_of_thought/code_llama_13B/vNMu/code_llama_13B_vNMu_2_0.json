This is a form of argument called a 'reductio ad absurdum', which means 'reduction to absurdity'.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the premise is logically valid. The premise states that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest, but this does not necessarily mean that the conclusion follows. In order for the argument to be logically valid, we need to show that the premise leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the premise. The premise states that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. This means that there is no evidence or reason to believe that the griffin was in the forest. However, this does not necessarily mean that the griffin did not go into the forest.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion. The conclusion states that the griffin might not have been in the forest. This is a possible outcome based on the lack of evidence or reason to believe that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the argument is logically valid. Since the premise does not lead to a logical contradiction, and the conclusion is a possible outcome based on the lack of evidence or reason to believe that the griffin was in the forest, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
