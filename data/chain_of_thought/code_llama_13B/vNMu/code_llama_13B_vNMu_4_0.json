This is a conditional argument, also known as a 'possibility argument'.\n\nStep 2: Determine if the premise is logically valid. The premise states that it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars. This means that there is no logical necessity for the alien to have visited Mars. However, this does not necessarily mean that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. The conclusion states that the alien might not have visited Mars. This conclusion is logically valid because it is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars, given that there is no logical necessity for the alien to have visited Mars.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the argument is logically valid. The argument is logically valid because the premise and conclusion are both logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
