This is a form of argument called \"affirming the negative.\"\n\nStep 2: Determine if the premise is logically valid. In this case, the premise is \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway,\" which means that it is possible for the newspaper to not be in the driveway. Therefore, the premise is logically valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the conclusion \"The newspaper might not be in the driveway\" follows logically from the premise because it is possible for the newspaper to not be in the driveway, as stated in the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument form of \"affirming the negative\" is logically valid in this case.
