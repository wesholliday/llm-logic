This is a form of argument called \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\nStep 2: Determine if the premise is logically valid. The premise states that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, which means that there is at least one possibility that she did not choose pizza. This is a valid premise because it does not rule out the possibility of Sue choosing something else.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. The conclusion states that Sue might not have chosen pizza, which means that there is at least one possibility that she did not choose pizza. This conclusion follows logically from the premise because it does not rule out the possibility of Sue choosing something else.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the argument is logically valid. The argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premise and the premise is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
