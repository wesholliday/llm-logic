This is an example of a modus tollens argument, which is logically valid.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the premise and conclusion. The premise states that it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake, which means that there is no reason to assume that the vampire was awake. The conclusion then states that the vampire might not have been awake, which is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nStep 3: Check for any logical fallacies or inconsistencies in the argument. There are none in this case.\n\nAnswer: yes",
