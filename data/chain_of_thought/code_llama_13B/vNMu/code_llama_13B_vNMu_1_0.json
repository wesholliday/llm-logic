            "content": "\nPremise: It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\nConclusion: Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nStep 1: Identify the argument form. This is a form of argument called \"affirming the negation.\"\n\nStep 2: Determine if the premise is logically valid. The premise states that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, which means that either Mary was not at the wedding or she might have been at the wedding. Since we don't know for sure whether Mary was at the wedding or not, this premise is logically valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. The conclusion states that Mary might not have been at the wedding, which means that it's possible that she was not at the wedding but we don't know for sure. This conclusion does follow logically from the premise because the premise only rules out the possibility that Mary must have been at the wedding, and since we don't know for sure whether she was at the wedding or not, it's possible that she might not have been there.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. Answer: yes",
