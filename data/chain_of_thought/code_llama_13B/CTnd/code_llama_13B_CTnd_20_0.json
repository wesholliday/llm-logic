The original statement states that if a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation, while the negation states that if a recommendation was not made, then it was a strong recommendation. These two statements have opposite meanings.\n\nStep 4: Conclude whether we can infer 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made' from the original statement.\nNo, we cannot infer 'If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made' from the original statement. The two statements are not equivalent, and the negation of the original statement does not imply that if a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made.",
