To determine if it is valid, we need to check if the premise leads to the conclusion.\n\nPremise: Jane studied.\nConclusion: She did not study long.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the premise and conclusion.\n\nThe premise \"Jane studied\" is a statement that can be either true or false. The conclusion \"She did not study long\" is also a statement that can be either true or false. However, we cannot determine if the conclusion follows from the premise without more information.\n\nStep 6: Draw a conclusion.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is not possible to infer that \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\" This statement is not necessarily true because there could be other factors at play that affect whether or not Jane studied long.\n\nAnswer: No",
