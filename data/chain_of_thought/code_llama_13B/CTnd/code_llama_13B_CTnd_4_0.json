In this case, the first statement is \"Ben studied\" and the second statement is \"he did not study diligently.\" The relationship between these two statements is that if Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether we can infer the opposite of the given statement.\n\nTo determine whether we can infer the opposite of the given statement, we need to analyze the relationship between the two statements. In this case, the relationship is a logical implication, which means that if the first statement (Ben studied) is true, then the second statement (he did not study diligently) must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether we can infer the opposite of the given statement.\n\nBased on our analysis, we cannot infer the opposite of the given statement. This is because the relationship between the two statements is a logical implication, which means that if the first statement (Ben studied) is true, then the second statement (he did not study diligently) must also be true. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\" because it would contradict the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
