The first clause states that if the issue was discussed, and the second clause states that it was not discussed in depth.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the logical relationship between the clauses.\nThe logical relationship between the clauses is \"if-then.\" This means that the second clause (not discussed in depth) only applies when the first clause (discussed) is true.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the statement is logically consistent.\nThe statement is logically consistent because it does not contain any contradictions or logical fallacies. The two clauses are related by a logical \"if-then\" relationship, which means that the second clause only applies when the first clause is true.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the statement can be inferred from the given information.\nThe statement cannot be inferred from the given information because it is not explicitly stated in the question. The question only asks whether the issue was discussed, and does not mention anything about depth of discussion. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\n\nAnswer: No",
