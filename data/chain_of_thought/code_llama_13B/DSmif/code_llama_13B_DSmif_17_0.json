The first statement implies that if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in my backpack, but the second statement contradicts this by suggesting that the scarf may or may not be draped on the coat rack. Therefore, we cannot infer that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
