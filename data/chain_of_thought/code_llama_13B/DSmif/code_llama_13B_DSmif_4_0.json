This is because if the cat were not playing in the bedroom and it was not napping on the couch, then it would have to be doing something else (e.g., eating, grooming, etc.). However, since we know that the cat isn't doing anything else, it must be napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: yes.",
