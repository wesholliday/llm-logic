The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This means that if we know that Sue was at the wedding, we can infer that Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is \"Mary was at the wedding.\" Based on the premises, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding because if she were not at the wedding, then Sue would not have been there either. Therefore, we can conclude that Mary was indeed at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
