Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (if P then Q) and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is also true. In this case, we know that \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is true because we are given that the pants were denim, and we are asked to infer that the shirt was cotton.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, we can conclude that the shirt was cotton by using modus ponens.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
