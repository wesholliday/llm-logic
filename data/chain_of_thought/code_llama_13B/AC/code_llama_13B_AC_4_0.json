The first premise states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter. However, this does not necessarily mean that the alien visited Mars. It is possible that the robot visited Jupiter without the alien visiting Mars. Therefore, we cannot infer that the alien visited Mars based on the given premises.",
