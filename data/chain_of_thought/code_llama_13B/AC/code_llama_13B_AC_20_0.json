(Premise)\n\t+ The banana was yellow. (Conclusion)\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the premise and conclusion.\n\n* The premise is a conditional statement that states if the apple was red, then the banana would be yellow. This means that if we know the apple was not red, then we cannot infer that the banana was yellow.\n* The conclusion is a simple statement that states the banana was yellow.\n\nStep 4: Draw conclusions.\n\n* Based on the premise and conclusion, we cannot infer that the apple was red. The premise only states what would happen if the apple was red, but it does not provide any information about the actual color of the apple. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the apple was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
