            "content": "\nStep 1: The premises are \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nStep 2: We need to determine whether the conclusion \"The shirt was cotton\" follows logically from these premises.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we can use a logical deduction method called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a statement A and its consequence B, then we can infer that A is true. In other words, if A implies B, and B is true, then A must be true.\n\nStep 4: We can apply modus ponens to the premises \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were denim.\" If we assume that the first premise is true (i.e., if the shirt was cotton), then we can deduce that the second premise must also be true (i.e., the pants were denim).\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we have established that \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were denim\" are both true.\n\nStep 6: We can now use modus ponens to conclude that \"The shirt was cotton\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
