This means that if the alien did not visit Mars, it does not necessarily follow that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nStep 5: However, we are also told that \"The robot visited Jupiter\". This information is independent of whether or not the alien visited Mars.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The alien visited Mars\" is true based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
