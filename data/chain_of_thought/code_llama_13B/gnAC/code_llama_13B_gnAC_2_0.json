(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: We need to determine whether the conclusion is logically valid based on the given premises.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we can use a truth table to evaluate the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| T | T | T |\n| F | T | F |\n| T | F | F |\n| F | F | F |\n\nStep 4: Based on the truth table, we can see that the conclusion is logically valid if and only if both premises are true. Therefore, the answer to the question is 'Answer: yes'.",
