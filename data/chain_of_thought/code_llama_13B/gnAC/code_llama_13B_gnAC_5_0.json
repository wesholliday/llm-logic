This means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nStep 3: We also know that the second statement is true because we are told that Amy played tennis.\n\nStep 4: Based on the information provided, we can conclude that \"Jeff played basketball\" is not necessarily true. This is because we only know that Jeff played basketball if he did not play tennis, and we have no way of knowing whether or not he played tennis. Therefore, we cannot say for certain that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: No",
