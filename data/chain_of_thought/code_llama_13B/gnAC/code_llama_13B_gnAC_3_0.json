In other words, we need to determine whether it is possible for the book to be a mystery novel without being written by James.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we can use a logical table to evaluate all possible combinations of the premises and the conclusion. Here's what the table looks like:\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| James wrote the book | The book is a mystery novel | James wrote the book |\n| James did not write the book | The book is a mystery novel | James did not write the book |\n| James wrote the book | The book is not a mystery novel | James wrote the book |\n| James did not write the book | The book is not a mystery novel | James did not write the book |\n\nStep 4: From the table, we can see that there are two possible combinations of premises and conclusion:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n2. If the book was not written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\nStep 5: In both cases, the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, we can conclude that it is possible for the book to be a mystery novel without being written by James.\n\nAnswer: No",
