The statement \"If you glurp, it will hurt my snarfs\" is not a valid statement because it does not make sense. Snarfs are not a real thing, and therefore, it cannot be harmed by anything, including glurping.\n\nTherefore, the question itself is based on a false premise, and any further reasoning or conclusions drawn from it would also be invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
