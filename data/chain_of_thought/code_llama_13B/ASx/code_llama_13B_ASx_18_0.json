Instead, it simply states that if the zonk is twiddled, then it will pluzzle.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer the new statement from the given statement.\n\nNo, we cannot infer the new statement from the given statement because it does not provide any information about whether or not the zonk is blorped. The new statement \"If the zonk is twiddled and it is blorped, then it will pluzzle\" is a different statement that is not logically implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
