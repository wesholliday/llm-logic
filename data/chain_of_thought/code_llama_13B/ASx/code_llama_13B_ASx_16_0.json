This implies a causal relationship between the two entities.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the additional information provided in the question can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nThe additional information provided in the question is \"If the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked.\" This information does not provide any new information about the relationship between the trankle and zorple, but rather provides more context about the situation. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
