This implies that there is a direct causal relationship between the two events.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the additional information provided in the question changes the relationship between the events.\n\nIf we add the information that the quib is squinked, it does not change the relationship between the zibble and glorp. The statement still states that if a zibble is zapped, then a glorp will zoom. However, this additional information does not affect the causal relationship between the events.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that 'If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon' is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
