The \"then\" clause indicates that the skrizzle is in this state because of the glop's position.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the additional information provided in the question can be used to infer a new statement.\n\nThe additional information provided in the question, \"If the glop is on the brink and the bloop is zorped,\" does not provide any new information that would allow us to make an inference about the skrizzle's state. The only logical relationship between these two statements is that they both involve the glop being at a critical point, but this does not necessarily imply anything about the skrizzle's position.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the glop is on the brink and the bloop is zorped, then the skrizzle is plonked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
