This means that if a plink has changed its shape or form, it will cause something to vibrate or shake.\n\nStep 4: Apply this understanding to the given question.\n\n* If we assume that \"misglommed\" is a typo and should be replaced with \"morphed,\" then we can infer that if the plink has morphed and it was misglommed, then it will tizzle. This means that if a plink has changed its shape or form and it was previously misglommed (i.e., not properly shaped), it will cause something to vibrate or shake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
