This means that if we know that the flugel was not blimmed, then we cannot infer that it was zargled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the information provided and our evaluation of it, we cannot infer that \"the flugel was not zargled\" based on the fact that \"if the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No",
