In this case, the conclusion is \"the flob was not movated\" and the premise is \"the flob was skizzled.\" The argument is invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premise.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nThe argument is invalid because it is based on a false premise (i.e., the assumption that if the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated). This means that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, and therefore the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
