In this case, the conclusion of the argument is \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" The premise that is used to support this conclusion is \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nBased on the given premises, we can conclude that the argument is invalid. This is because the conclusion of the argument does not logically follow from the premise. The fact that the smonk was not vreebled does not necessarily mean that it was not plagged. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
