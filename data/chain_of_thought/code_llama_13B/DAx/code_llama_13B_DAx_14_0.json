Therefore, we can infer that the first statement is also false.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the truth value of the second statement.\n\n* The second statement is \"The clug was not fleeked.\"\n* This statement is a negative statement, which means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"not\") is false.\n* In this case, the antecedent is \"The clug was fleeked,\" which is false based on the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the second statement is also true.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the truth values of the two statements, we can conclude that the third statement \"The clug was not snugged\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
