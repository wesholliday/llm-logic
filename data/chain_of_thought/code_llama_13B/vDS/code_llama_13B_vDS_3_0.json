Since we have assumed that the keys are in the drawer, it follows that they must be in the drawer. Therefore, the assumption is true.\nStep 3: From premise 2, we know that the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet. Since we have assumed that the keys are in the drawer, it follows that they can't be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, the assumption is consistent with the premises.\nStep 4: From steps 2 and 3, we know that the assumption is both true and consistent with the premises. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
