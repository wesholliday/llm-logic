This means that if a fleeg was bluttered, it would surn.\n\nStep 3: Apply logic to the situation.\nWe can infer that if a fleeg was not bluttered, it did not surn. This is because the given information only applies when a fleeg is bluttered, and therefore, we can assume that if a fleeg is not bluttered, it does not surn.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: yes",
