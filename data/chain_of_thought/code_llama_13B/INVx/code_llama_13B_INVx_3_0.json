This implies that there is a causal relationship between morphing and quanking.\n\nStep 3: Apply the principle of non-contradiction.\n\nIf we assume that the statement \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" is true, then it would be contradictory to the original statement. This means that the assumption must be false.\n\nStep 4: Conclude.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" from the given statement. The answer is no.",
