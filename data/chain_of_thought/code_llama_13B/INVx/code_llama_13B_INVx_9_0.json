The premise only states that if the twonk is plinked, then it is varnished, but it does not say anything about what happens when the twonk is not plinked. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished\" from the premise alone.\n\nStep 3: Conclude whether or not the argument is valid.\nBased on the reasoning above, we can conclude that the argument is invalid because the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise. Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: no.\"",
