However, this does not necessarily mean that if the sprocket was not cranked, it would also not be daggled.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled\" from \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" The two statements are not logically equivalent, and we cannot make a conclusion based on one statement alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
