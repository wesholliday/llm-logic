This means that if the dreb was vroombed, it is certain that the dreb was spened. However, we are not told anything about what happens when the dreb is not vroombed.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\". This is because there is no information provided that would allow us to make such an inference. The only thing we know for certain is that if the dreb was vroombed, it was spened.\n\nAnswer: No",
