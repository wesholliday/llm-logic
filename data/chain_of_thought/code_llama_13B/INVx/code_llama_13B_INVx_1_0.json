However, we are not given any information about what happens to the flugel when it is not blimmed.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions.\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled.\" This is because there is no information about what happens to the flugel when it is not blimmed. Therefore, we cannot make any conclusions about whether the flugel was or was not zargled when it was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: No",
