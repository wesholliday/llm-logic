Therefore, we can conclude that the wolf was not in the den.\n4. This argument is logically valid because it follows a logical form of reasoning known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a valid form of inference where if a conclusion follows from a premise and its negation, then the negation of the conclusion must be true. In this case, the first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den, and the second premise states that the bear was not in the cave. Therefore, we can conclude that the wolf was not in the den.\n5. Answer: yes",
