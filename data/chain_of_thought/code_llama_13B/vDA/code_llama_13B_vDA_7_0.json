Specifically, if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris must have finished the race (since Alex finishing the race implies that Chris also finished it). However, this contradicts Premise 2, which states that Alex did not finish the race.\nStep 4: Therefore, we have derived a contradiction from Premises 1 and 2, which means that our initial assumption in Step 1 must be false (i.e., if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race).\nStep 5: Since our initial assumption was false, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
