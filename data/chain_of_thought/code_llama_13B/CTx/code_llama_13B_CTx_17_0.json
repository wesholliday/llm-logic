In this case, the statement implies that if something is skizzled, it must be movated, and vice versa. However, there may be other factors at play that do not involve movement or appearance.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the given statement can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nNo, we cannot infer \"If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" from the original statement. The original statement only states that if the flob is skizzled, it will movated, and does not provide any information about what happens when the flob is not skizzled. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusion about whether or not the flob was not skizzled based solely on the fact that it did not move.\n\nAnswer: No",
