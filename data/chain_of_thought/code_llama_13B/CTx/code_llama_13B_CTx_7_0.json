This means that if the whiffle was damaged or broken in some way, it would make a small, sharp sound when played.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the second statement is logically equivalent to the first statement.\n\nThe second statement states that if the whiffle did not tink, then it was not shanked. This means that if the whiffle did not make a small, sharp sound when played, then it must have been in good condition and not damaged or broken.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether the two statements are logically equivalent.\n\nThe two statements are logically equivalent because they both describe the same relationship between the whiffle and its tinked state. If the whiffle is shanked, it will tink when played, but if it does not tink, then it must be in good condition and not damaged or broken.\n\nAnswer: yes",
