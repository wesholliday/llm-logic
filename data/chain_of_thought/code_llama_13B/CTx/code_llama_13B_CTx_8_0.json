However, this does not necessarily mean that if a sprocket is not daggled, it must have been uncranked.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" from \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" The statement is not logically equivalent and does not follow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
