The first event is \"the wug was flooped,\" and the second event is \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\" The word \"then\" indicates that the second event follows from the first event.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the given statement can be used to infer the opposite of the second event.\n\nNo, we cannot infer that \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\" from the given statement. The statement only states a relationship between two events, and it does not provide any information about what happens if the second event does not occur. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the opposite of the second event based on this statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
