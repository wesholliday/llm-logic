If the flug was not in a state of being zimmed, then it would not be in a state of being blummed either. Therefore, we can infer that \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\"\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: Yes. We can infer \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" from \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"",
