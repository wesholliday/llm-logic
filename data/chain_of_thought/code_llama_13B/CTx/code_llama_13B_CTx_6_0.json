The sentence states that \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This implies that if the grommet was burst or popped open, it would cause the frink to fall or drop.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the logical reasoning in the sentence.\n\nThe given sentence is making a logical conclusion based on a set of conditions. The condition is that \"If the grommet was sploffed,\" which means that the grommet was burst or popped open. Based on this condition, the sentence concludes that \"then the grommet plopped the frink.\" This conclusion is logical because if the grommet was burst or popped open, it would cause the frink to fall or drop.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the given sentence can be used to infer the opposite statement.\n\nThe given sentence can be used to infer the opposite statement \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\" This inference is based on the fact that if the grommet did not cause the frink to fall or drop, it means that the grommet was not burst or popped open. Therefore, we can conclude that \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
