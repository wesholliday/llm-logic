This is because the word \"morphed\" implies a change or transformation in the thing being described, and \"quanked\" implies some kind of action or reaction to that change.\n\nStep 3: Apply this analysis to the given question.\n\nThe question asks whether we can infer \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\" To answer this question, we need to consider what it means for something to be morphed and what it means for something to quank.\n\n* If something is morphed, it has undergone a change or transformation in some way.\n* If something quanks, it reacts to that change or transformation in some way.\n\nTherefore, if the splat did not quank, we cannot infer that it was not morphed. This is because quanking and morphing are related concepts, and a lack of quanking does not necessarily mean that something has not been morphed.\n\nAnswer: No",
