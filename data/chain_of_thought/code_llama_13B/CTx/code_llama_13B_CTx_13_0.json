If the glip was not tragged (i.e., it was not dirty), does that mean it was not slogged (i.e., it was not wet)?\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe answer is no. We cannot infer \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" from the given information. The statement \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" does not imply that if the glip was not tragged (i.e., it was not dirty), it must have been not slogged (i.e., it was not wet).\n\nAnswer: no",
