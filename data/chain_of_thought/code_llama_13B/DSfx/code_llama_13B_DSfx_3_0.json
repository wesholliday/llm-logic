We can't infer anything about the splat being quanked from this statement alone, as it could be either one of those options.\n\nStep 3:\nHowever, we are also given the second statement, which states that the splat is not quanked. This tells us that the splat cannot be quanked, as we have already established that it is not quanked. Therefore, we can infer that the splat must be morphed.\n\nStep 4:\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can conclude that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
