In this case, the condition is \"Jeff played basketball,\" and the consequence is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the information to determine whether we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball\" from the given statements.\n\nBased on the second statement, if Jeff played basketball, then Amy would have played tennis. However, since Amy did not play tennis, it is not possible for Jeff to have played basketball and still meet the condition of the second statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that Jeff did not play basketball from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
