In this case, the condition is \"the alien visited Mars.\" If this condition is true, then the robot will visit Jupiter.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the information given to determine whether we can infer anything about the alien's visit to Mars.\n\nSince we are given that the robot did not visit Jupiter, and we know that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot would visit Jupiter, it follows that the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, we can infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
