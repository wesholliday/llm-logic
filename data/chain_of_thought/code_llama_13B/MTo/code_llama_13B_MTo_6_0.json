In this case, the condition is \"Sue chose pizza,\" and the consequence is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the information provided to determine whether we can infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\" from the given statements.\n\nBased on the first statement, we know that Bob did not choose pasta. However, this does not necessarily mean that Sue did not choose pizza. The second statement only states what will happen if Sue chose pizza, but it does not provide any information about what happened if she did not choose pizza. Therefore, we cannot infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
