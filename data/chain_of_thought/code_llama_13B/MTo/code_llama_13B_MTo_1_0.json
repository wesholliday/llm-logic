If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the argument.\nThe argument is a conditional statement, which means that it is possible for the conclusion to be true even if the premise is false. In this case, the premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" and the conclusion is \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\nThe argument is invalid because it is possible for the conclusion to be true even if the premise is false. In this case, the premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding,\" which means that if Mary was not at the wedding, then the conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" would still be true. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
