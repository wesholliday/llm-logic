In this case, the condition is \"Joe went to the park,\" and the consequence is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the information.\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that Lucy did not go to the zoo because she was not at the park where Joe went. Therefore, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
