This means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"The book was written by James.\"\n\nStep 3: Since we know that the book is not a mystery novel, we can conclude that the antecedent of the second premise is false. This means that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
