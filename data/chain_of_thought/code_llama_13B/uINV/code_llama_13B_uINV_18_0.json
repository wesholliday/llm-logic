            "content": "\nStep 1: The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement. This means that if the doll was plastic, then it is logically possible for the truck to be metal. However, this does not necessarily mean that the truck must be metal if the doll is not plastic.\n\nStep 2: To determine whether we can infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal, we need to consider all possible scenarios. If the doll is not plastic, then it could be made of any material, including metal. Therefore, it is not necessarily true that the truck would also be non-metal if the doll is not plastic.\n\nStep 3: In conclusion, we cannot infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal. The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" does not provide enough information to make this inference. Therefore, the answer is 'no'.",
