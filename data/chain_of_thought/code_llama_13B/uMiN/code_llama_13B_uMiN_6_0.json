We are also told that she did not choose sushi.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the information provided.\nThe only piece of information we have about Sue's choice is that she did not choose sushi. This does not tell us whether she chose pizza or not.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\nWe cannot infer that it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza, because we do not know for certain what her choice was. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",
