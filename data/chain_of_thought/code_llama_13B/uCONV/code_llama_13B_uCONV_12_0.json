In this case, the first statement states that if Joe goes to the park, then Lucy will go to the zoo. The second statement simply states that Lucy did in fact go to the zoo. This does not necessarily imply that Joe went to the park.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: No",
