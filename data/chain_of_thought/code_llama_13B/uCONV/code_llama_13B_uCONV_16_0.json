The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is not logically equivalent to \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.\" This is because the first statement implies a causal relationship between the type of fabric and the clothing item, while the second statement only states that if the pants are denim, then the shirt must be cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton. The two statements are not equivalent, and we cannot make a logical conclusion based on one from the other.\n\nAnswer: no",
