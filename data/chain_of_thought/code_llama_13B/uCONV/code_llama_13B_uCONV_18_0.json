This means that if the doll was plastic, then it is logically possible that the truck was metal. However, this does not necessarily mean that the truck was actually metal.\n\nStep 2: The statement \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" is also a conditional statement. This means that if the truck was metal, then it is logically possible that the doll was plastic. However, this does not necessarily mean that the doll was actually plastic.\n\nStep 3: Since both statements are conditionals, we cannot infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic. This is because the conditions under which the statements hold true may be different. For example, it is possible that the doll was plastic only if the truck was not metal, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: No",
