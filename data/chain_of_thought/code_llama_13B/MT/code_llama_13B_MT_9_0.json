The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then we cannot conclude that Mark bought the blue shirt. Therefore, the second premise is true, which states that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. Since the conclusion follows logically from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
