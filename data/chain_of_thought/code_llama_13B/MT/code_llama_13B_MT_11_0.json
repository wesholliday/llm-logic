This means that if the first part of the statement (the antecedent) is true, then the second part of the statement (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: The statement \"The muffins were not blueberry\" is a negative statement. This means that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nStep 3: Based on the conditional statement and the negative statement, we can conclude that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we cannot infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given information. The only conclusion we can draw is that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nAnswer: No",
