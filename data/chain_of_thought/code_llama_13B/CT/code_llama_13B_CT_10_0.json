The conclusion is \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. To evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the logical structure of the argument. The argument has a conditional structure, with the premise being \"If the dog was inside\" and the conclusion being \"Then the cat was outside.\"\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. To determine this, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. The conclusion is a negation of the premise, which means that it is not necessarily true if the premise is true.\n\nStep 6: Conclude whether the argument is valid or invalid. Since the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
