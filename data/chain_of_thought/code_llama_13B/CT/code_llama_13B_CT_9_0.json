The conclusion is \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. To evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nFor example, suppose Lisa bought the red shirt and Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This would mean that the premise is true (Lisa bought the red shirt), but the conclusion is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt). Therefore, we cannot infer that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
