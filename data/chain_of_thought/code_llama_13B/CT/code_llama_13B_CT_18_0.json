The conclusion is \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. To evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. In order for the conclusion to be true, we would need to know that the doll was plastic and the truck was metal. However, the premise only tells us that if the doll is plastic, then the truck must be metal. It does not tell us anything about the relationship between the doll and the truck. Therefore, the conclusion cannot be logically inferred from the premise.\n\nStep 5: Write the answer. Answer: no",
