The statement only states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. It does not state that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nStep 4: Provide an example to support your answer.\n\nConsider a scenario where Mary and Sue were both invited to the wedding but only Mary attended. In this case, the premise (Mary was at the wedding) is true, but the conclusion (Sue was not at the wedding) is false. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
