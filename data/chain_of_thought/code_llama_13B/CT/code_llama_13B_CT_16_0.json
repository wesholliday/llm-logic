The conclusion is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. The argument is invalid because it is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. This occurs when we assume that if something happens (in this case, the pants being denim), then another thing must also happen (the shirt being cotton). However, this assumption is not necessarily true and does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
