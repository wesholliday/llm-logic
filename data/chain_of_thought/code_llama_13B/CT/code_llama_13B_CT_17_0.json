            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the premise. The premise is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion. The conclusion is \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. To evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Determine the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion is a conditional statement. In other words, the conclusion states that if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. This means that the conclusion is only true if the premise is also true.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the premise is true or false. The premise is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" This statement is true because it is a conditional statement and both sides of the condition are true.\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the conclusion based on the premise. Since the premise is true, we can conclude that if Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta. Therefore, the conclusion is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
