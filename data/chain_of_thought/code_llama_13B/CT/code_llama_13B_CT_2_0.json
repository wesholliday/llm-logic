            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement.\nThe given statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the logical relationship between the two statements.\nThe given statement is an if-then statement, which means that if the first part (the antecedent) is true, then the second part (the consequent) must also be true. In this case, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the given statement can be used to infer the opposite of the first statement.\nTo determine whether we can infer the opposite of the first statement, we need to consider the logical relationship between the two statements. In this case, since the if-then statement is a conditional statement, it implies that the consequent is only true when the antecedent is true. Therefore, we cannot infer the opposite of the first statement by simply reversing the order of the words in the statement.\n\nStep 4: Conclude whether we can infer 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest' from the given statement.\nBased on our analysis above, we cannot infer 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest' from the given statement. Therefore, the answer is no.",
