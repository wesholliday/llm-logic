The conclusion is \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. To evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Determine the logical relationship between the premise and the conclusion. The conclusion logically follows from the premise if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise. In this case, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise because it is a negation of the premise.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. Since the conclusion logically follows from the premise and the premise is true, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
