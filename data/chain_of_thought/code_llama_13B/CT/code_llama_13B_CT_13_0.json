In this case, we can say that if the car was red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the conclusion.\nWe have determined that the conclusion of the original statement is \"the truck was blue.\" If we negate this conclusion, we get \"the truck was not blue.\" Therefore, we can infer that if the car was red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: yes",
