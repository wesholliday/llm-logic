The conclusion is \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. To evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nFor example, let's say that Sam took a plane and Erin did not take a train. This would mean that Erin did not take a train, but it does not necessarily mean that Sam did not take a plane. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
