The conclusion is \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. To evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nFor example, suppose that the bear was in the cave and the wolf was in the den. However, it is possible for the wolf to be in the den without the bear being in the cave. Therefore, we cannot infer that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: No",
