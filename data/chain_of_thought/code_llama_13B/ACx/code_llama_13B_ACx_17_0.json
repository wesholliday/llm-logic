This means that if we know that the flob moved, we cannot infer that it was not skizzled.\n* The second statement simply states that the flob movated.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the information.\n\n* Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the flob was skizzled. The only thing we can say is that if the flob moved, it was not necessarily skizzled.\n\nAnswer: No",
