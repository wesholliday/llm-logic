In this case, the if-then relationship is \"if the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n* The second statement is a simple statement, which means that it does not contain any logical operators such as \"if\" or \"then.\"\n\nStep 4: Determine whether we can infer \"The shank was plooked\" from the information provided.\n\n* Based on the information provided, we cannot infer \"The shank was plooked\" because there is no direct connection between the two statements. The first statement only states a consequence of an if-then relationship, and the second statement does not provide any additional information about whether the shank was plooked or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
