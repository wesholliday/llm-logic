The statement \"If I am lying, then I am telling the truth\" leads to a contradiction if we assume that it is true. If we assume that the statement is true, then it must be false, since it says that it is lying. But if it is false, then it must be true, since it says that it is telling the truth. This creates an infinite loop of contradictions, and there is no way to resolve the paradox.\n\nAnswer: No",
