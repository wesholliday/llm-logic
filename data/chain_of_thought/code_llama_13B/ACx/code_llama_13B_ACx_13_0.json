This means that if we know that the glip was slogged, we can infer that it was also tragged.\n* The second statement simply states that the glip was tragged.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the glip was slogged from the fact that it was tragged. This is because the first statement only provides a conditional relationship between the two states, and does not provide any direct evidence that the glip was slogged. Therefore, the answer to the question is \"Answer: no.\"",
