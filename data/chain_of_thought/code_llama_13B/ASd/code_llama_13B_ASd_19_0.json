The statement \"If you fill up the gas tank, the car will run\" is not a logical conclusion and cannot be inferred from it.\n\nThe correct inference would be \"If there is a hole in the gas tank, the car will not run.\" This is because filling up the gas tank does not guarantee that the car will run if there is a hole in it. Therefore, the statement \"If you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run\" is false.\n\nAnswer: No",
