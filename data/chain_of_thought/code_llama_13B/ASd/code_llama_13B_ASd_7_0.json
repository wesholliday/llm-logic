In this case, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise because it is possible for the oven to be on and the pilot light to be out while the kitchen remains cold. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
