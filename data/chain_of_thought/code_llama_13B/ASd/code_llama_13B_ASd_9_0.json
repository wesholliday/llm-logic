The fact that the essay is well-written does not necessarily mean that it will be graded as an A if it is turned in late. There may be other factors, such as the instructor's discretion or the specific criteria for the assignment, that could influence the grade.\n\nStep 4: Reason through the conclusion based on the premise.\nThe conclusion \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A\" cannot be logically inferred from the premise \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\" Therefore, the answer to the question is \"Answer: no.\"",
