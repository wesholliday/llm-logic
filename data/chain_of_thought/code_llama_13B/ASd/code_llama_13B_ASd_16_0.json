The conclusion is \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the premise. The premise is a hypothetical statement that assumes fertilizing the lawn will result in a lush and green appearance. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, as other factors such as soil quality, water availability, and weather conditions may also play a role in determining the appearance of the lawn.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion. The conclusion is a hypothetical statement that assumes fertilizing the lawn during a drought will result in a lush and green appearance. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, as other factors such as soil quality, water availability, and weather conditions may also play a role in determining the appearance of the lawn during a drought.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion. Based on the evaluation of the premise and conclusion, it can be concluded that we cannot infer \"If I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green\" from \"If I fertilize the lawn, it will be lush and green.\" The assumption in the conclusion is not necessarily true, as other factors may also play a role in determining the appearance of the lawn during a drought.\n\nAnswer: No",
