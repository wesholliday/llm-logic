It only applies to people who are able to get enough sleep.\n\nStep 3: Consider the hypothetical scenario.\nIf we were to assume that \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired\" is true, then we can infer that \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" is also true. However, this is not necessarily a safe assumption because it does not take into account the individual's physical or mental state, as well as the specific circumstances of the labor.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion based on the premise and assumptions.\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired\" is true. The statement is not a universal truth and does not apply to all situations and individuals. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer: No",
