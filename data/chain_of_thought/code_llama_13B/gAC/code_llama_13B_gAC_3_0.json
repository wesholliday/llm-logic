Modus ponens states that if we know that a statement A implies a statement B, and we also know that A is true, then we can conclude that B is also true.\n\nStep 4: In our case, the premise \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" implies the conclusion \"The book is a mystery novel.\" Since we already know that the book is a mystery novel (premise 2), we can use modus ponens to conclude that \"The book was written by James\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
