            "content": "\nStep 1: The premises are \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" and \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nStep 2: We need to determine if the conclusion \"The shirt was cotton\" follows from these premises.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we can use a logical deduction technique called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (i.e., an if-then statement) and its antecedent is true, then we can conclude that the consequent must be true as well.\n\nStep 4: In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" The antecedent (i.e., the if-part) is \"The shirt was cotton,\" which we know to be true based on the first premise.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, by modus ponens, we can conclude that \"The pants were denim\" must be true as well.\n\nStep 6: Since we have already established that \"The pants were denim\" is true, and we are trying to determine if \"The shirt was cotton\" follows from these premises, we can use modus ponens again to conclude that \"The shirt was cotton\" must be true as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
