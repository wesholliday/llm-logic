This means that if the mummy is awake, it is possible that the vampire is not awake.\n\nStep 5: However, we are given additional information that the mummy was awake. This tells us that the mummy is indeed awake, but it does not tell us anything about whether the vampire is also awake or not.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, based on the given information, it does not follow logically that \"The vampire was awake\" is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
