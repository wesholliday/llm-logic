            "content": "\nStep 1: The premises are \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nStep 2: We need to determine if the conclusion \"The apple was red\" follows from these premises.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we can use a logical deduction method called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (i.e., an \"if-then\" statement) and its antecedent is true, then we can conclude that the consequent is also true.\n\nStep 4: In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" The antecedent (i.e., the \"if\" part) is \"The apple was red,\" which is true based on our premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent (i.e., the \"then\" part) \"The banana was yellow\" is also true.\n\nStep 5: Since we have deduced that \"The banana was yellow\" is true from the conditional statement and its antecedent being true, we can conclude that \"The apple was red\" is also true based on modus ponens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
