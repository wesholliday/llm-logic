Modus ponens states that if we have a statement A and its consequence B, then we can infer that B is true. In other words, if A implies B, and B is true, then we can conclude that A is true.\n\nStep 4: In this case, the premises are \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" and \"The wolf was in the den.\" The conclusion we want to draw is \"The bear was in the cave.\"\n\nStep 5: Using modus ponens, we can infer that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. Since the wolf was in the den, it follows that the bear was in the cave. Therefore, the conclusion \"The bear was in the cave\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
