Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (i.e., an if-then statement) and its antecedent is true, then we can conclude that the consequent is also true.\n\nStep 4: In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" The antecedent of this statement is \"The dog was inside,\" which is true based on our premise. Therefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that the consequent of this statement, \"The cat was outside,\" must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Since the conclusion \"The dog was inside\" does not follow from these premises, we can say that the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
