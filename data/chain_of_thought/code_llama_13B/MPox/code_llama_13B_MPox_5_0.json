In this case, the first statement (Premise 1) states that the zinger was fraggled, and the second statement (Premise 2) states that if the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows a logical relationship between two statements. The first statement (Premise 1) provides evidence that the zinger was fraggled, and the second statement (Premise 2) provides evidence that if the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled. Therefore, we can infer that the zinger was smoogled based on the argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
