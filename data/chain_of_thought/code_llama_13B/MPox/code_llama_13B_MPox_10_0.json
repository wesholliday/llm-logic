The wug was sproinged.\n2. If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. However, this does not necessarily mean that the wug was garpled. We need more information to make a conclusion about whether or not the wug was garpled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer \"It was garpled\" from the given statements alone. Therefore, the answer is no.",
