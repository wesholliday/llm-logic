However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the clug snugged in all cases where it was fleeked.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the information provided to determine whether or not we can infer \"The clug snugged.\"\n\n* Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the clug snugged from \"The clug was fleeked\" and \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\" The second statement only tells us that if the clug was fleeked, then it snugged, but it does not tell us whether or not the clug snugged in all cases where it was fleeked. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The clug snugged\" from this information alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
