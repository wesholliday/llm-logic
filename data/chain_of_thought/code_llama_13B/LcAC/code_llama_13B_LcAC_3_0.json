In other words, we need to determine whether the first statement implies the second statement.\n\nStep 4: The first statement is a conditional statement, which means that it only implies the second statement if the condition (i.e., \"If the book was written by James\") is true. However, we don't know for sure whether this condition is true or not. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude \"The book was written by James\" from these premises.\n\nStep 5: Based on our analysis, we can conclude that we cannot logically conclude \"The book was written by James\" from the given premises. Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: no.\"",
