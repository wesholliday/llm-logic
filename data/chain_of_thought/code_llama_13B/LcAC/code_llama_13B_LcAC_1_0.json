It only implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be there.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is a direct statement, which means it is true by definition. Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nStep 4: We can conclude that the first statement does not necessarily imply that Mary was at the wedding. It only implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be there. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on these two statements alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
