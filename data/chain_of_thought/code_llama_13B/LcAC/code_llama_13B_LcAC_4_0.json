This statement is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (the part before \"then\") is true, the consequent (the part after \"then\") must also be true.\n\nStep 4: The antecedent of this statement is \"The alien visited Mars.\" Since we know that the robot visited Jupiter, we can conclude that the antecedent must be true.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we can logically conclude that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
