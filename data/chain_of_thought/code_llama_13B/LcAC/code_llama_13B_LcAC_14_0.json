This means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true.\n\nStep 2: We are given that the wolf was in the den. Therefore, we can conclude that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\nStep 3: Since the antecedent is true, we can use the truth table for conditionals to determine the truth value of the entire statement. The truth table shows that if the antecedent is true and the consequent is true, then the whole statement is true. In this case, the consequent is \"the wolf was in the den,\" which is true because we were given that the wolf was in the den. Therefore, we can conclude that the whole statement \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" is true.\n\nStep 4: Since the whole statement is true, we can logically conclude that the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
