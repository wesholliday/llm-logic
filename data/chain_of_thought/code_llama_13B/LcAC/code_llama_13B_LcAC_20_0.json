Modus ponens is a logical rule that states that if we have a conditional statement (i.e., an if-then statement) and the consequent of that statement is true, then we can infer that the antecedent of the statement is also true.\n\nStep 3: In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" The consequent of this statement is \"The banana was yellow,\" which is true based on our premise. Therefore, we can infer that the antecedent of the statement, \"The apple was red,\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
