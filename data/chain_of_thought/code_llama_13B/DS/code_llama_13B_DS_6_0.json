Therefore, the phone must be in either the living room or somewhere else.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Since the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen and we are given two options (either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen), we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: yes",
