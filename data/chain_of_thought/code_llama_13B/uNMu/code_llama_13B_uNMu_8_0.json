To answer this question, we need to consider the context of the story and the information given about the vampire's behavior.\n\nFrom the text, we know that the vampire was able to move around during the day without being seen by anyone. This suggests that the vampire might have been awake during the day, but it does not necessarily mean that the vampire was always awake. The vampire could have been asleep at some point during the day, and still be able to move around undetected.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided in the story, we cannot infer with certainty whether the vampire was awake or not. However, it is possible that the vampire might not have been awake at some point during the day.\n\nAnswer: yes",
