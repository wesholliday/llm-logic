To answer this question, we need to consider the relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe first statement, \"it is not the case that the alien must have visited Mars,\" means that there is no evidence or proof that the alien visited Mars. This statement alone does not necessarily imply that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the alien did visit Mars and then consider the second statement, \"Can we infer that the alien might not have visited Mars?\" we can draw a conclusion that the alien might not have visited Mars. This is because the first statement suggests that there is no evidence or proof of the alien's visit to Mars, which implies that it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the alien might not have visited Mars.
