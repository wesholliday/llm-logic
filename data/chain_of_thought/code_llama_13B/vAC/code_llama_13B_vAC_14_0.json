The conclusion states that the bear was in the cave.\n4. To determine whether this argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n5. In order for an argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must logically follow from the premises.\n6. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n7. The first premise states that if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den. This means that if the bear was not in the cave, then it is possible for the wolf to be in the den without the bear being there.\n8. However, the second premise states that the wolf was in the den. This implies that the wolf must have been in the den regardless of whether or not the bear was in the cave.\n9. Therefore, the conclusion that the bear was in the cave is not logically valid because it does not follow from the premises.\n10. Answer: no",
