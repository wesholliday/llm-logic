In this case, the antecedent is \"If the sprocket was cranked.\"\n* The second premise is a negative statement, which means that it states that something is not the case. In this case, the statement is \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether we can infer the conclusion from the premises.\n\n* The conclusion we are trying to draw is \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n* We cannot infer this conclusion from the premises because the first premise only applies when the sprocket is cranked, and the second premise states that it is not the case that the sprocket must be daggered. This means that we do not know whether the sprocket was cranked or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
