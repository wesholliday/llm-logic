This means that if the dreb was vroombed, we can conclude that it was spensed.\n* The second premise states that it is not the case that the dreb must have been spensed. This means that there is no evidence to suggest that the dreb was spensed.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the premises, we can conclude that if the dreb was vroombed, then it was not spensed. Therefore, we can infer that \"the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
