This means that if we assume the splat was morphed, we can conclude that it must have quanked.\n* The second premise states that it is not the case that the splat must have quanked. This means that we cannot infer that the splat must have quanked based on this premise alone.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the evaluation of the premises, we cannot infer that \"the splat was not morphed\" from the given information. Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: no.\"",
