Therefore, we cannot infer that if the package has shipped and was misrouted, it will arrive today.\n\nTo answer your question, we would need more information about the specific circumstances surrounding the shipment. If the package was indeed misrouted, then it's possible that it may not arrive today, but rather at a later date when the issue is resolved. However, without further details, it's impossible to say for certain whether the package will arrive today or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
