While fertilizing the lawn can help maintain its health and appearance during a drought, it does not necessarily guarantee that the lawn will be lush and green even if there is no rainfall.\n\nThere are several factors that can affect the growth of a lawn, including soil quality, sunlight, water availability, and pest and disease management. If these factors are not properly managed, even with fertilization, the lawn may not be as lush and green as desired.\n\nTherefore, while it is possible to infer that if I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green, it is not entirely accurate to make such an inference without considering other factors that can affect the lawn's growth.\n\nAnswer: no",
