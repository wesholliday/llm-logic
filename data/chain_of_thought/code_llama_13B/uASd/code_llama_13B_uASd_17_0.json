The statement \"If I change the oil, the car will run smoothly\" is not necessarily true, as there are many other factors that can affect the performance of a vehicle beyond just the oil. Additionally, changing the transmission does not necessarily require changing the oil.\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if I change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will run smoothly.
