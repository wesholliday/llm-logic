Premise 1 states that the shoes aren't lined up by the door, which means that they must be in the closet. Since premise 2 states that either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door, it follows that if the shoes aren't lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises and is a valid argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
