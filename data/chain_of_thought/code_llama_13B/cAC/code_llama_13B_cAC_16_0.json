Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (i.e., an if-then statement) and its antecedent is true, then we can infer the consequent. In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim,\" and its antecedent is \"The shirt was cotton.\" Therefore, we can infer that \"The pants were denim\" by using modus ponens.\n\nStep 3: We have concluded that the shirt was cotton based on the premises provided. Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: yes.\"",
