The first statement only applies when the condition (the griffin being in the forest) is true, but we are not given any information about whether or not the griffin was actually in the forest.\n* Therefore, we cannot use the first statement to infer that the griffin was also in the forest, and we cannot conclude that it was based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
