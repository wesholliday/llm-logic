(This is a conditional statement.)\n* Premise 2: The banana was yellow. (This is a fact.)\n\nStep 3: Determine whether we can conclude \"The apple was red.\"\n\n* Based on the premises, we cannot conclude that the apple was red because the first premise is a conditional statement and does not provide enough information to determine whether the apple was red. The second premise only states that the banana was yellow, which does not necessarily imply that the apple was red. Therefore, we cannot conclude \"The apple was red\" based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
