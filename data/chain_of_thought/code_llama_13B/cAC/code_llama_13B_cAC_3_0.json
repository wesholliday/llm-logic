In other words, we need to determine whether the first premise implies the second premise.\n\nStep 4: The first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it is a mystery novel. This means that if we know that the book is a mystery novel, we can conclude that it was written by James. However, this does not necessarily mean that we can conclude the opposite - that James wrote the book.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, we cannot conclude \"The book was written by James\" from these premises alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
