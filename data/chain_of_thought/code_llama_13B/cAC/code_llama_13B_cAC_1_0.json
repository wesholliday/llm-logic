In other words, if Mary was at the wedding, then it follows that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: However, we are not given any information about whether or not Mary was actually at the wedding. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about her presence at the wedding based solely on the first statement.\n\nStep 4: The second statement, \"Sue was at the wedding,\" is a separate piece of information that does not depend on the first statement. Therefore, even if we assume that Mary was not at the wedding, we can still conclude that Sue was there based solely on this statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
