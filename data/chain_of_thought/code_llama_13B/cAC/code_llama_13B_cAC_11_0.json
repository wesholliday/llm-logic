This means that if the first part of the statement (the antecedent) is true, then the second part of the statement (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: The statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" is a factual statement. This means that it is a statement that can be proven or disproven based on evidence.\n\nStep 3: Based on the two statements, we can conclude that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were also blueberry. However, this does not necessarily mean that the cake was actually chocolate. The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement, which means that it only implies a relationship between the two statements and does not provide any evidence to support the conclusion that the cake was actually chocolate.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we cannot conclude \"The cake was chocolate\" based on the given information. The answer is \"Answer: no\".",
