The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" implies that if the keys are not in the drawer, then they must be dangling in the cabinet. However, the second statement rules out this possibility by stating that it is not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, we can conclude that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
