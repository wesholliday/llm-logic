The statement \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\" implies that the shoes cannot be both in the closet and lined up by the door at the same time.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door\" means that it is possible for the shoes to be in the closet without being lined up by the door.\n3.
