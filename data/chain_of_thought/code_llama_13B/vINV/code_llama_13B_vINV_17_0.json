In this case, the premise uses \"then\" and the conclusion uses \"then not\".\n\nAnswer: yes\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. If the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise, then the argument is invalid.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion does follow logically from the premise. If Ben did not eat pasta, then it is possible that Kate ate something else, such as salad or another type of food. Therefore, the conclusion \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" follows logically from the premise \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
