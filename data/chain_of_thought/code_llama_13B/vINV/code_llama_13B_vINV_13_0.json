However, this does not necessarily mean that the truck must be blue if the car is not red.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is a conditional statement that states \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" This means that if the car was not red, it is logically possible for the truck to be not blue. However, this does not necessarily mean that the truck must be not blue if the car is red.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the evaluation of the premise and conclusion, we can conclude that the argument is not logically valid. The argument fails to establish a logical connection between the premise and conclusion. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",
