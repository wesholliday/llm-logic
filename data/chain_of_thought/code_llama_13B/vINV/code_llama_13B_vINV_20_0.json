It means that if A is true, then B must also be true. However, it does not necessarily mean that if A is false, then B is also false. Therefore, the premise is logically valid.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is a conditional statement that states \"If not A, then not B.\" This type of statement is called a biconditional statement. It means that if A is false, then B must also be false. However, it does not necessarily mean that if A is true, then B is also true. Therefore, the conclusion is logically valid.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is logically valid.\nThe argument is logically valid because both the premise and the conclusion are logically valid statements. The argument does not rely on any false assumptions or logical fallacies. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: yes'.",
