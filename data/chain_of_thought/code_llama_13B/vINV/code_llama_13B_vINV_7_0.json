In this case, the premise uses \"if...then\" while the conclusion uses \"if...then.\"\n\nAnswer: yes\n\nStep 2: Check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. To do this, we need to determine if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nIn this case, the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise. The conclusion states that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race. However, this does not necessarily mean that Chris finished the race if Alex did finish the race. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
