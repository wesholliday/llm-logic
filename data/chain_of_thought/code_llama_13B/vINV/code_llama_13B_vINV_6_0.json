This type of statement is called a causal relationship.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is also a conditional statement that states if something (Sue not choosing pizza) does not happen, then something else (Bob not choosing pasta) will also not happen. However, this conclusion is different from the premise in that it is a negative statement.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is logically valid.\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow from the premise. The conclusion states that if something (Sue not choosing pizza) does not happen, then something else (Bob not choosing pasta) will also not happen. However, this statement is not necessarily true. It is possible for Sue to not choose pizza and Bob to still choose pasta. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
