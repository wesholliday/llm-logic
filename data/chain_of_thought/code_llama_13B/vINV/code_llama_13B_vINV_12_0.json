The premise states that if something happens (Joe went to the park), then another thing will happen (Lucy went to the zoo). The conclusion states that if the opposite of the premise happens (Joe did not go to the park), then the opposite of the conclusion will also happen (Lucy did not go to the zoo). This is a valid argument because it follows the logical form of a conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
