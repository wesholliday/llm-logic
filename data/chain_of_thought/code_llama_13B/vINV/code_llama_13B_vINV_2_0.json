However, this does not necessarily mean that the unicorn must be in the forest if the griffin is not there.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is a conditional statement that states \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\" This means that if the griffin is not in the forest, it is logically possible for the unicorn to be not in the forest as well. However, this does not necessarily mean that the unicorn must be not in the forest if the griffin is there.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is logically valid.\nThe argument is not logically valid because it does not follow from the premise to the conclusion. The premise only states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest, but it does not state that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid and the conclusion cannot be deduced from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
