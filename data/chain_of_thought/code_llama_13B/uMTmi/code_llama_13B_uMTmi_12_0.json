However, this is not explicitly stated in the premises. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Joe did not go to the park based solely on these premises.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that Joe did not go to the park. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",
