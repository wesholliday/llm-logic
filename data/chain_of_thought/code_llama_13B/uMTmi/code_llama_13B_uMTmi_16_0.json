The statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" is a logical conclusion, but it doesn't necessarily follow from the information given. It's possible that the person wearing the shirt and pants could be wearing any type of fabric for both items, including cotton and denim.\n\nTherefore, I cannot infer whether the shirt was not cotton based on the information provided. The answer is \"Answer: no\".",
