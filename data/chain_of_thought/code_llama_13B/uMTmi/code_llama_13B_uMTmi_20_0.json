This means that if the apple was red, then it is logically necessary that the banana would be yellow.\n\nStep 2: However, the statement \"The banana might not have been yellow\" contradicts the first statement. If the banana might not have been yellow, then it is no longer logically necessary that the banana would be yellow if the apple was red.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, we cannot infer that the apple was not red based on the information provided. The apple could still be red, and the banana could still be yellow or not yellow.\n\nAnswer: No",
