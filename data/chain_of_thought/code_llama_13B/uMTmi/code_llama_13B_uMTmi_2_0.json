This means that if the first part of the statement (the antecedent) is true, then the second part of the statement (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: The antecedent of this statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest.\" This means that we are assuming that the griffin was indeed in the forest.\n\nStep 3: The consequent of this statement is \"then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\" This means that if the griffin was in the forest, then it follows logically that the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nStep 4: However, we are not given any information about whether or not the unicorn was actually in the forest. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the unicorn's location based solely on the fact that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
