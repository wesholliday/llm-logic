This means that if the assumption (the car was red) is true, then the conclusion (the truck was blue) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: We are given the additional information that \"The truck was blue.\" This tells us that the assumption (the car was red) is false, because if the assumption were true, then the conclusion (the truck was blue) would not be true.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, we cannot deduce that \"The car was red\" from the given information. The statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is a conditional statement, and the assumption (the car was red) is false, so we cannot conclude that the conclusion (the truck was blue) must be true.\n\nAnswer: No",
