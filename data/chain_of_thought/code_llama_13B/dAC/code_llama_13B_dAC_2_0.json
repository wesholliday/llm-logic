This means that if we know the griffin was in the forest, we can infer that the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n* The second statement simply states that the unicorn is in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the information provided, we cannot deduce \"The griffin was in the forest\" from the given statements alone. We can only conclude that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn would also be in the forest. However, this does not necessarily mean that the griffin is in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
