In other words, if we know that the apple is red, does it follow that the banana is yellow?\n* The answer is no. Just because the apple is red does not necessarily mean that the banana is yellow. There could be many other reasons why the banana is yellow, such as it being a yellow banana or it being in a yellow environment. Therefore, we cannot deduce \"The apple was red\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
