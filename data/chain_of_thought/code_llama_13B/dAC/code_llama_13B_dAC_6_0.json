This is because the first statement states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. Therefore, if Bob chose pasta, it follows that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nStep 3: Based on the second statement, we know that Bob chose pasta. Since the first statement implies that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue must have chosen pizza, we can conclude that Sue must have chosen pizza as well.\n\nTherefore, from 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta' together with 'Bob chose pasta', we can deduce that 'Sue chose pizza'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
