This is because the \"then\" clause of the first statement implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must also have finished it.\n\nStep 3:\nNow, let's consider the second statement. We are told that Chris finished the race. This means that he did not finish the race if and only if Alex did not finish the race. In other words, we can deduce that if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have also finished it.\n\nStep 4:\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can conclude that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that we cannot deduce anything about whether or not Alex finished the race based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
