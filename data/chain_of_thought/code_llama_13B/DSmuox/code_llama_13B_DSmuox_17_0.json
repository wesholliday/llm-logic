If the flob is skizzled, then it does not need to be moved. However, if the flob is not skizzled, then it must be moved.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the premises, we cannot infer that \"the flob is skizzled\" because the second premise only states that either the flob is skizzled or it must be moved. It does not provide any information about whether the flob is actually skizzled or not. Therefore, the conclusion is \"Answer: no.\"",
