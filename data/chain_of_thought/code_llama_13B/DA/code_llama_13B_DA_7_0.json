Alex did not finish the race.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the argument.\nWe can infer that Chris did not finish the race from the first premise alone because it states a conditional statement. The conditional statement \"If A, then B\" implies that if A is true, then B must also be true. In this case, since Alex did not finish the race (premise 2), we can conclude that Chris did not finish the race as well (premise 1).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: yes.",
