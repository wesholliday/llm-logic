This means that if the doll was plastic, then it follows that the truck must be metal.\n\nStep 2: We are given that the doll was not plastic. Therefore, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nStep 3: Since the doll was not plastic, we know that the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is false. This means that the conclusion of the conditional statement, which is that the truck must be metal, is also false.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we can infer that the truck was not metal.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
