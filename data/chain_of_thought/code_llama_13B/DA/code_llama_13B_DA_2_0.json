This means that it is only true if the first part of the statement (the antecedent) is true.\n\nStep 2: In this case, the antecedent is \"The griffin was in the forest.\" However, we are given that the griffin was not in the forest. Therefore, the antecedent is false, and the conditional statement is also false.\n\nStep 3: Since the conditional statement is false, we cannot infer that the unicorn was not in the forest. In other words, \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" is not a logical conclusion from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
