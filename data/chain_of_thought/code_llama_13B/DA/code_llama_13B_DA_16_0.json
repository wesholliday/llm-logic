This means that if the first part of the statement (the antecedent) is true, then the second part of the statement (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: The antecedent of this statement is \"The shirt was cotton.\" However, we have already been told that the shirt was not cotton. Therefore, the antecedent is false.\n\nStep 3: Since the antecedent is false, we cannot infer anything about the consequent. In other words, we cannot say whether or not \"The pants were denim\" is true based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
