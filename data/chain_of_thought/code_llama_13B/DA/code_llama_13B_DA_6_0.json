This is because if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta by the logic of Premise 1. However, since Premise 2 states that Sue did not choose pizza, it follows that Bob did not choose pasta either.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Bob did not choose pasta based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
