Modus tollens states that if a conclusion follows from a premise and its negation, then the premise must be false. In this case, the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" follows from the premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" and its negation \"Joe did not go to the park.\" Therefore, we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: yes",
