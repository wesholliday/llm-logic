From \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spensed,\" we know that either the dreb is vroombed or it is spensed.\n\nStep 3: Apply logic to the information.\n\nIf the dreb is not spensed, then it must be vroombed. Therefore, we can infer \"The dreb is vroombed\" from \"The dreb is not spensed\" and \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spensed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
