    "user_prompt": "Suppose a fantole, a dribban, and a snorpul have the best odds to win this season's Rizzle Cup. Oddsmakers believe it's most probable the fantole will capture the cup, followed by the dribban, while the snorpul is a heavy longshot. Since these are the only top contenders, if the dribban doesn\u2019t win the cup, then if the fantole doesn\u2019t win, the snorpul will win. Moreover, the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, the snorpul will?",

            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument.\n\nPremise 1: The fantole has the best odds to win the Rizzle Cup.\nPremise 2: If the dribban doesn't win the cup, then if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will win.\nPremise 3: The fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the argument based on the given premises.\n\nThe argument is a conditional argument, which means that it is based on a condition or hypothesis. In this case, the condition is that the fantole has the best odds to win the Rizzle Cup and the dribban likely won't win. The conclusion is that if the fantole doesn't win the cup, then the snorpul will win.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument based on the given premises.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows a logical structure of conditional reasoning. The first premise states that the fantole has the best odds to win the Rizzle Cup, which implies that the likelihood of the fantole winning is higher than the dribban and snorpul. The second premise states that if the dribban doesn't win the cup, then if the fantole doesn't win, the snorpul will win. This premise is based on the assumption that the dribban has a lower chance of winning than the fantole and snorpul. The third premise states that the fantole likely will win the cup and hence the dribban likely won't win. This premise is based on the assumption that the fantole has a higher chance of winning than the dribban and snorpul.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows a logical structure of conditional reasoning and the given premises are true. Therefore, if the fantole doesn't win the Rizzle Cup, then the snorpul will win.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
