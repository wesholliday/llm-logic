    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

The fact that the darpil is expected to be second in the league does not necessarily mean that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, then it's likely that the votal will. There could be other factors at play that affect the outcome of the season.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on your analysis.\nTherefore, the argument is invalid. It does not follow that if the fraglen doesn't lead the league, then it's likely that the votal will.",
