    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premise of the argument.\nThe premise of the argument is that if the dringen does not have a breakout season, then if the flinker does not have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the reasoning behind the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is based on the assumption that if the dringen does not have a breakout season, then it is highly probable that the flinker will have a breakout season and hence the n\u00fcffen will not. However, this assumption is not explicitly stated in the argument. Therefore, we cannot conclude that it is likely that if the flinker does not have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion based on the premise and reasoning.\nThe conclusion does not logically follow from the premise and reasoning provided in the argument. Therefore, we cannot say that it is likely that if the flinker does not have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season.\n\nAnswer: No",
