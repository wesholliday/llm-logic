    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantug, a loperit, and a frallon are shortlisted for Blither of the Year. Industry watchers consider the fantug the front runner, followed by the loperit, while the frallon is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only products in contention, if the loperit doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the fantug doesn\u2019t win, the frallon will win. Moreover, the fantug likely will win the award and hence the loperit likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will?",

The first premise states that the fantug is considered the front runner for Blither of the Year, which implies that it is likely to win. The second premise states that if the loperit doesn't win the award, then if the fantug doesn't win, the frallon will win. This means that if the fantug does not win, the frallon will win. Finally, the third premise states that it is likely that the fantug will win the award. Therefore, based on these premises and conclusion, it follows that it is likely that, if the fantug doesn't win Blither of the Year, the frallon will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
