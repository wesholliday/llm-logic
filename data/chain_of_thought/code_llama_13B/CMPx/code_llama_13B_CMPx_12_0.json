    "user_prompt": "Suppose a stribben, a vanoon, and a jentapp are applying to rent a bondle. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant, followed by the vanoon, while the jentapp seems much less qualified to rent a bondle. Since these are the only applicants, if the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected. Moreover, the stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the stribben isn\u2019t selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be?",

            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument.\n\nThe premises of the argument are:\n\n1. The owner thinks the stribben is the strongest applicant.\n2. The vanoon seems much less qualified to rent a bondle than the stribben.\n3. If the vanoon isn\u2019t selected, then if the stribben isn\u2019t selected, the jentapp will be selected.\n4. The stribben likely will be chosen and hence the vanoon likely won\u2019t be.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the argument for validity.\n\nThe argument is invalid because it is based on a false assumption that the owner's preference for the stribben as the strongest applicant is a reliable indicator of their qualifications to rent the bondle. The argument also assumes that the vanoon is less qualified than the stribben, which may not be true.\n\nStep 3: Conclude whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nThe argument is invalid because it is based on false assumptions and does not provide a logical conclusion. Therefore, it cannot be used to determine whether it's likely that if the stribben isn't selected to rent the bondle, the jentapp will be.",
