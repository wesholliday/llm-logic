    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument.\nThe premises are:\n\n* The fantole is the most downloaded fillip app this month.\n* The dribban is likely to retain the top spot in downloads.\n* The cruggit has a significantly lower download rate than the dribban.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the argument's structure.\nThe argument is based on a series of logical implications, with each premise leading logically to the next.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument's validity.\nThe argument is valid because it follows a logical sequence of reasoning. Each premise logically implies the next, and the conclusion follows from these implications.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\nYes, the conclusion follows from the premises. If the fantole is not the most downloaded app, then it must be the dribban that is the most downloaded, since the dribban is likely to retain the top spot in downloads. And if the dribban is the most downloaded, then the cruggit's download rate must be significantly lower than the dribban's, since the cruggit has a significantly lower download rate than the dribban. Therefore, it is likely that the cruggit will be the most downloaded app if the fantole is not the most downloaded.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
