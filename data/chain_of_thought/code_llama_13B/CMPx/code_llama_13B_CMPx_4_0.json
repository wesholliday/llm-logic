    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crinel, a nafiz, and a tomul are competing to be snarggle of next year's laggle team. The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, followed by the nafiz, while the tomul is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates, if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. Moreover, the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be?",

            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument.\n\nPremise 1: The crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle.\nPremise 2: If the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle.\nPremise 3: The crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nConclusion: It is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument based on the given information.\n\nThe argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The first premise states that the crinel is considered the frontrunner for snarggle, which means that they have a higher chance of being named snarggle than the other two candidates. The second premise states that if the nafiz isn\u2019t named snarggle, then if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle. This implies that if the crinel is not named snarggle, it is likely that the tomul will be named snarggle. The third premise states that the crinel likely will be named snarggle and hence the nafiz likely won\u2019t be. This means that if the crinel is named snarggle, it is unlikely that the nafiz will be named snarggle. Therefore, based on the given information, it is likely that, if the crinel isn\u2019t named snarggle, the tomul will be named snarggle.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
