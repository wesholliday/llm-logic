    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument.\n\nPremise 1: The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant.\nPremise 2: The cramen is not as qualified as the jantiz.\nPremise 3: If the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the argument based on the given premises.\n\nThe argument is based on a series of logical implications. The first two premises suggest that the jantiz is more qualified than the cramen and the sulect, respectively. The third premise states that if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument based on the given premises.\n\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows a series of logical implications. The first two premises provide the basis for the third premise, which states that if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. This means that if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, it is likely that the sulect will get it.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question based on the given premises and the logical implications.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
