    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a vringlet, a crappen, and a strorvil are shortlisted for the Liggerton Award in bloffu this year. Bloffu critics regard the vringlet as the front runner, followed by the crappen, while the strorvil is a heavy underdog. Since these are the only finalists under consideration, if the crappen doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win, the strorvil will win. Moreover, the vringlet likely will win the award and hence the crappen likely won\u2019t win. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the vringlet doesn\u2019t win the Liggerton Award, the strorvil will?",

The first two premises are related to the probability of winning the award, while the third premise is related to the likelihood of winning the award.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument based on the given premises.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows a logical sequence of implications. The first two premises are related to the probability of winning the award, while the third premise is related to the likelihood of winning the award. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
