    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trenist, a lanken, and a draloid are shortlisted for Drij of the Year. The trenist is considered the front runner, followed by the lanken, while the draloid is a long shot. Since these are the only candidates in contention, if the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it. Moreover, the trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trenist doesn\u2019t win Drij of the Year, the draloid will?",

            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument.\n\nPremise 1: The trenist is considered the front runner.\nPremise 2: The lanken is a long shot.\nPremise 3: If the lanken doesn\u2019t win the award, then if the trenist doesn\u2019t win it, the draloid will win it.\nPremise 4: The trenist likely will win the award and hence the lanken likely won\u2019t win it.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the argument based on the given premises.\n\nThe argument is based on the idea that if the trenist doesn't win Drij of the Year, then the draloid will win it. This is because the lanken is a long shot and hence unlikely to win the award, so if the trenist doesn't win it, the draloid will be the only remaining candidate in contention.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument based on the given premises.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows logically from the given premises. The conclusion (that if the trenist doesn't win Drij of the Year, the draloid will) is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question based on the evaluation of the argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
