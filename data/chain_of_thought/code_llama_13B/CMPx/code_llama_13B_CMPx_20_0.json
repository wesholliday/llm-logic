    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a trundle, a foopet, and a crangor are likely to be the top selling whippits. The trundle will likely be #1 in sales, followed closely by the foopet, with the crangor having significantly lower expected sales. These lead whippit sales, so if the foopet isn\u2019t the top seller, then if the trundle isn\u2019t, the crangor will be. Moreover, the trundle likely will lead sales and hence the foopet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the trundle isn\u2019t the top selling whippit, the crangor will be?",

            "content": "Step 1: Identify the premises of the argument.\nThe premises are:\n\n* The trundle is likely to be the top selling whippit.\n* The foopet is likely to be the second best-selling whippit, following closely behind the trundle.\n* The crangor has significantly lower expected sales than the trundle and the foopet.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the argument's structure.\nThe argument is based on a series of logical implications. Each premise implies the next one in the chain, with the conclusion being that if the trundle isn't the top selling whippit, then it's likely that the crangor will be.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument's validity.\nThe argument is valid because each premise logically implies the next one in the chain. The conclusion follows from the premises and is therefore a logical consequence of them.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
