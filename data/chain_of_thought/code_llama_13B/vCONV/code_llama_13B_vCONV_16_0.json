However, this does not necessarily mean that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton. In other words, just because the pants are denim doesn't mean that the shirt is cotton.\n\nFor example, let's say that the shirt and pants are both made of a material called \"fabric.\" If we know that the shirt is fabric, then it could be either cotton or denim. Similarly, if we know that the pants are fabric, then they could also be either cotton or denim. Therefore, just because the pants are denim doesn't mean that the shirt is cotton.\n\nIn conclusion, this argument is not logically valid because it does not follow from the premise to the conclusion.
