In this case, the antecedent is \"Sue chose pizza\" and the consequent is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\nThe conclusion is a conditional statement that states \"If B, then A.\" This type of statement is called a biconditional statement, and it is considered logically valid as long as both the antecedent (B) and the consequent (A) are true. In this case, the antecedent is \"Bob chose pasta\" and the consequent is \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\nThe conclusion does not follow logically from the premise. The premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. However, the conclusion states that if Bob chose pasta, then Sue chose pizza. This is a different statement than the premise, and it does not necessarily follow logically from the premise.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the argument is logically valid or invalid.\nThe argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise. The conclusion is not a necessary consequence of the premise, and therefore the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
