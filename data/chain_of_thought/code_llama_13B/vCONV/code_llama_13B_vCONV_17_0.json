In this case, the premise uses \"if-then\" (i.e., \"If A, then B\") while the conclusion uses \"if-then\" again (i.e., \"If C, then D\").\n\nStep 2: Check if the logical connective used in the premise and conclusion are consistent with each other. In this case, they are both \"if-then,\" which means that the argument is using a valid form of reasoning.\n\nStep 3: Check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does logically follow from the premise, as it states that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta. This is a logical consequence of the premise, which states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. Answer: yes",
