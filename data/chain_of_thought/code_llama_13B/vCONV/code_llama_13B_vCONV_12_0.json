However, it is not necessarily true that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe must have gone to the park. The conclusion only implies that if Lucy went to the zoo and Joe did not go to the park, then the premise would be false.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the argument is logically valid.\nThe argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The conclusion only implies that if Lucy went to the zoo and Joe did not go to the park, then the premise would be false. However, there are other possible scenarios where the premise could be true but the conclusion would still be false.\n\nAnswer: No",
