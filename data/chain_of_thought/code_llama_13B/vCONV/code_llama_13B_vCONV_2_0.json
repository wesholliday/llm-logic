The premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest.\n2. The conclusion states that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was also in the forest.\n3. However, this conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. Just because the griffin and unicorn are both in the forest doesn't mean that they have to be together. There could be other animals in the forest as well.\n4. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
