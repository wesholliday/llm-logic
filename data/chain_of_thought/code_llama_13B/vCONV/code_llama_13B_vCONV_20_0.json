It only becomes true when the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is also true. In this case, the antecedent is \"If the apple was red\" and the consequent is \"Then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\nThe conclusion is a conditional statement that states \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\" This means that it is only true when the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true and the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is also true. However, this does not necessarily follow logically from the premise, which states \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\nThe conclusion does not follow logically from the premise because it is possible for the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") to be true and the consequent (the part after the \"then\") to be false. For example, if the apple was red but the banana was not yellow, then the conclusion would be false even though the premise is true.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the argument is logically valid or invalid.\nBased on the previous steps, we can conclude that the argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow logically from the premise. Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: no.\"",
