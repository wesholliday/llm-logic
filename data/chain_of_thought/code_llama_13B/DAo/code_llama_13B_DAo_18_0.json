This is because the second statement explicitly states that if the doll is plastic, then the truck will be metal.\n\nStep 4: Since we know that the doll is not plastic (from step 1), we can conclude that the truck is not metal. This is because if the doll was plastic, then by the logic of the second statement, the truck would have to be metal. However, since we know that the doll is not plastic, it follows that the truck cannot be metal either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
