This means that it is possible for Mary to have not attended the wedding, but we don't know for sure whether she did or didn't attend.\n2. The conclusion states that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding. This means that if Mary did not attend the wedding, then it is not necessarily true that she must have attended.\n3. The argument is logically valid because the premise and conclusion are consistent with each other. If Mary might not have been at the wedding, then it's not necessarily true that she must have been there. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
