The premise states that \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\" This means that it is possible, but not necessarily the case, that Sue did not choose pizza.\n2. The conclusion states that \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\" This means that it is not true that Sue had to choose pizza in order for the argument to be valid.\n3. The conclusion follows logically from the premise, because if Sue might not have chosen pizza, then it is not necessarily the case that she did choose pizza. Therefore, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
