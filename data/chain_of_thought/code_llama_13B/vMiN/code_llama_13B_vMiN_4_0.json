The conclusion states that it is not the case that the alien must have visited Mars, which means that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. However, the premise only states that the alien might not have visited Mars, which does not necessarily mean that the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
