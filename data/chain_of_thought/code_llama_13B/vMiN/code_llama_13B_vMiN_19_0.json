This statement is a possible scenario, and it does not necessarily mean that the watch must not be charging on the dresser.\n2. The conclusion states that it's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser. This statement is a logical consequence of the premise, as it implies that there is no obligation for the watch to be charging on the dresser.\n3. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
