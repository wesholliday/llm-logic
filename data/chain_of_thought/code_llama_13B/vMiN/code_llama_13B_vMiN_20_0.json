The conclusion states that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n3. The conclusion follows logically from the premise, because if the sunglasses might not be in her bag, then it's possible that they are not in her bag, which means that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
