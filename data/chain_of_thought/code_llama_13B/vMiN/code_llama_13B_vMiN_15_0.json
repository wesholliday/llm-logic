This statement is a possible scenario, and it does not necessarily mean that the shoes are definitely not in the closet.\n2. The conclusion states that it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet. This statement is logically consistent with the premise because it acknowledges that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet, which is what the premise already established.\n3. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it does not commit to a specific conclusion (i.e., whether or not the shoes are in the closet) and instead allows for the possibility of both scenarios.\n\nAnswer: yes",
