This is a form of argument called a reductio ad absurdum, which means \"reduction to absurdity.\"\n\nStep 2: Determine if the premise is logically valid. The premise states that the pen might not be in my bag, but it does not provide any evidence or reasoning to support this claim. Therefore, the premise is not logically valid.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion based on the premise. Since the premise is not logically valid, the conclusion cannot be logically deduced from it. Therefore, the argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
