This statement is a possible scenario, and it does not necessarily mean that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n2. The conclusion states that it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair. This statement is a logical consequence of the premise, as it follows from the possibility that the jacket might not be draped over the chair.\n3. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
