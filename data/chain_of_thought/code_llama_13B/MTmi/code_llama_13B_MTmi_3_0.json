This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\" does not necessarily imply that the book is a mystery novel. It only implies that if the book was written by James, it might be a mystery novel. However, the premise \"The book might not be a mystery novel\" does not provide any information about whether or not the book was written by James.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The book was not written by James\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
