However, we are also told that Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n\nStep 3: This creates a contradiction, as we cannot determine whether Bob actually chose pasta or not based solely on the information provided.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, we cannot infer that Sue did not choose pizza from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
