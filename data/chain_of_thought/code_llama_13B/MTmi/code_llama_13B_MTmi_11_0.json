In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" The argument is trying to establish a conclusion by using this premise.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"The cake was not chocolate.\" This conclusion does not follow directly from the premises. In fact, the conclusion is the opposite of what we can infer from the premises.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the argument based on the conclusion.\n\nBased on the conclusion, we cannot conclude that \"The cake was chocolate.\" Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
