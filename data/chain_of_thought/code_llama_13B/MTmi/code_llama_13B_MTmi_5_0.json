In this case, the first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. The second premise states that Amy might not have played tennis.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This conclusion can be derived from the first premise if we assume that Jeff did not play basketball, and then use the second premise to show that Amy might not have played tennis. However, this conclusion does not follow logically from the premises as stated.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the argument based on the given information.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot conclude that Jeff did not play basketball. The first premise states that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. However, the second premise only states that Amy might not have played tennis, which does not provide any information about whether or not Jeff played basketball.\n\nTherefore, the argument is invalid because the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises as stated.\n\nAnswer: No",
