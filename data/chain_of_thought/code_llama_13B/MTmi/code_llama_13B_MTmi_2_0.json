This is because the first statement only implies that if the griffin is in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. It does not rule out the possibility that the griffin is in the forest and the unicorn is not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the griffin was not in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
