Therefore, if we assume that the fleeg is bluttered, we can conclude that it is not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\n* However, if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it may or may not be surned. In this case, we cannot infer anything about whether the fleeg is surned or not.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" is a possible inference from \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned\" and \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\" Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: yes.\"",
