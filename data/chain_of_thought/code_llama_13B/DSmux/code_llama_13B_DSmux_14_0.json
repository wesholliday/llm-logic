Therefore, if we assume that the clug is fleeked, we can conclude that it must be snugged.\n* However, if we assume that the clug must be snugged, then we cannot conclude that it is fleeked. This is because the statement \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged\" contradicts this assumption.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the information provided, we cannot infer whether the clug is fleeked or not. The contradiction between the two statements makes it impossible to determine which one is true.\n\nAnswer: No",
