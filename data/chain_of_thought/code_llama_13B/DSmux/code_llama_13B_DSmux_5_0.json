Therefore, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n* If the zinger must be smoogled, then it cannot also be fraggled. Therefore, we cannot infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nStep 4: Determine the answer.\n\nBased on the evaluation in step 3, we can conclude that \"The zinger is fraggled\" is a true statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
