Therefore, if we assume that the whiffle must be tinked, we can conclude that the whiffle is not shanked.\n* However, if we assume that the whiffle is shanked, then it does not have to be tinked. This means that the statement \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked\" is true.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the analysis above, we can conclude that the whiffle is shanked. Therefore, the answer to the question is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
