In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged.\" The argument is trying to establish a conclusion by using this premise.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nThe conclusion of the argument is \"The smonk was not vreebled.\" This conclusion does not follow directly from the premises. In fact, the second premise (\"The smonk might not have plagged\") contradicts the first premise (\"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\"). Therefore, we cannot infer \"The smonk was not vreebled\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
