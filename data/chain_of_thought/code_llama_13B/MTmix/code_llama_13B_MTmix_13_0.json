However, the second statement suggests that the glip might not have tragged.\n* This creates a logical contradiction, as the two statements cannot both be true at the same time.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\n* Based on the analysis, we cannot infer \"The glip was not slogged\" from the given information. The information is logically inconsistent and does not provide enough evidence to make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
