Since we have assumed that the conclusion is true, we can conclude that the umbrella is in the car.\nStep 3: From premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet. This means that the umbrella cannot be in the closet. Therefore, the only possible location for the umbrella is in the car.\nStep 4: We have shown that if the conclusion is true, then it follows from premise 1 and premise 2 that the umbrella must be in the car. Therefore, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
