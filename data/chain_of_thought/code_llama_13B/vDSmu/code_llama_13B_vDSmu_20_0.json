Since we have assumed that the sunglasses are in her bag, it follows that they cannot be perched on her head. Therefore, premise 1 is logically valid.\nStep 3: From premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head. Since we have assumed that the sunglasses are in her bag, it follows that they cannot be perched on her head. Therefore, premise 2 is logically valid.\nStep 4: From steps 1-3, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
