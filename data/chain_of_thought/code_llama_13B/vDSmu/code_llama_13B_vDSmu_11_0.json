The first premise states that either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch, which means that if the newspaper is not in the driveway, then it must be sitting on the porch. Since the second premise states that the newspaper must not be sitting on the porch, we can conclude that the newspaper must be in the driveway. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
