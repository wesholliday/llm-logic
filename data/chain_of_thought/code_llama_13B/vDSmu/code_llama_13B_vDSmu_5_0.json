Since we have assumed that the cookies are in the jar, it follows that the cookies cannot be hidden in the pantry.\nStep 3: From premise 2, we know that it's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry. This means that there is no possibility that the cookies are hidden in the pantry.\nStep 4: Therefore, we have shown that if the conclusion is true, then the premises must also be true. This is a valid argument.\n\nAnswer: yes",
