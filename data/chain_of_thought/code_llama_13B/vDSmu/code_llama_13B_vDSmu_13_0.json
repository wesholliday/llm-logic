This means that it must be the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\nStep 6: From step 5 and premise 1, we know that either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf. Since we have assumed that premise 2 is false, this means that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\nStep 7: However, this contradicts our assumption that the conclusion is true, which means that our initial assumption was incorrect.\nStep 8: Therefore, we have shown that if premise 2 is false, then the conclusion is also false.\nStep 9: Since we have shown that both the conclusion and premise 2 are logically consistent with each other, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
