This means that if the glip is not slogged, then it must be tragged.\n\nStep 3:\nWe are also given that the glip is not tragged. This means that the glip cannot be tragged, as we have already established that either the glip is slogged or it is tragged.\n\nStep 4:\nTherefore, we can conclude that the glip must be slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
