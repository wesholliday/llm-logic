This means that if the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked.\n\nStep 3:\nFrom the second statement, we know that the splat is not quanked. Therefore, if the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked.\n\nStep 4:\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
