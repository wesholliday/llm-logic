This means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"The bear was in the cave.\"\n\nStep 2: The statement \"The wolf was in the den\" is also a fact. It does not depend on any other statements or conditions.\n\nStep 3: Based on the information provided, we can logically infer that \"The bear was in the cave\" because the antecedent of the conditional statement is true and the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is also true. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The bear was in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
