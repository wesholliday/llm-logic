The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This implies that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa must have bought the red shirt. The second premise states that Mark bought the blue shirt. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
