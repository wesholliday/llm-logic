This means that if the apple is not red, then it cannot be inferred that the banana is yellow.\n\nStep 6: However, the conclusion states that the banana is yellow. This implies that the banana is not red, since the premise states that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow.\n\nStep 7: Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"The apple was red\" from the given information. The only logical conclusion is that the apple is not red, since the premise and conclusion are in conflict.\n\nAnswer: No",
