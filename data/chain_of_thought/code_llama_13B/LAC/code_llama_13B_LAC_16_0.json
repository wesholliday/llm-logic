This is because the first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n\nStep 3: The second premise states that the pants are indeed denim. Therefore, we can logically infer that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n\nStep 4: We have now established that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. However, this does not necessarily mean that the shirt was cotton. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the shirt was cotton based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
