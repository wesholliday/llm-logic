The first premise states that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta. This means that if Bob chose pasta, then we can logically infer that Sue chose pizza. Since the second premise states that Bob chose pasta, we can use this information to draw a conclusion about Sue's choice. Therefore, the argument is valid and we can conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
