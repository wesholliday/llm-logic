It only implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be there.\n\nStep 3: The second statement is a direct statement, which means it is true by definition. Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\nStep 4: We can use the law of non-contradiction to conclude that if Mary was not at the wedding, then she would be at the wedding. This contradicts the first statement, which implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be there.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.
