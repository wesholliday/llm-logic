The second statement implies that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned. Therefore, we cannot infer that the fleeg is bluttered based on these two statements alone.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion and provide an answer.\n\nBased on the analysis above, we cannot infer that the fleeg is bluttered from the given information. Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: no.\"",
