This implies that if the fribble is not snurgled, then it is also crinkled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on your analysis.\n\nBased on the relationship between the two statements, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled\" from \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinkled.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.",
