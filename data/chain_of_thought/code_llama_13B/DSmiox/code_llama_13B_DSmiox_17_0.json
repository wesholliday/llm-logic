This creates a logical contradiction, as the first statement suggests that the flob may not be moved, but the second statement requires that the flob must be moved if it is not skizzled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on your analysis.\n\nBased on the analysis above, we cannot infer that the flob is skizzled from the two statements provided. The contradiction between the two statements suggests that there may be other factors at play that are not accounted for in this scenario. Therefore, the answer to the question \"Can we infer 'The flob is skizzled' from 'The flob might not be movated' together with 'Either the flob is skizzled or it must be movated'?\" is no.",
