Therefore, if the wug is not garpled, it must be sproinged.\n* If the wug is garpled, then it cannot be sproinged because garpling and sproinging are mutually exclusive. Therefore, if the wug is garpled, it cannot be sproinged.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the reasoning above.\n\n* Based on the reasoning above, we can infer that \"The wug is sproinged\" because either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled. Since the wug cannot be garpled if it is not sproinged, we can conclude that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
