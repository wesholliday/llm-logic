This means that if the vampire was awake, it follows that the mummy must also be awake.\n\nStep 2: However, we are not given any information about whether the mummy was awake or not. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the mummy's state of being awake based on the fact that the vampire was awake.\n\nStep 3: Based on the information provided, it is not possible to determine whether the vampire was awake or not. Therefore, we cannot say with certainty whether the mummy must have been awake or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
