This means that if the first part of the statement (the antecedent) is true, then the second part of the statement (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: The antecedent of this statement is \"If the cake was chocolate.\" This means that if the cake was indeed chocolate, then the consequent must be true.\n\nStep 3: The consequent of this statement is \"then the muffins must have been blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then it can be inferred that the muffins were also blueberry.\n\nStep 4: However, we are not given any information about the color of the muffins. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the muffins must have been blueberry based solely on the fact that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No",
