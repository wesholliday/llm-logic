However, this does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football.\n\nStep 3: The second statement tells us that it is not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that there is a possibility that Jen did not watch basketball, even if Tom did watch football.\n\nStep 4: Based on the previous steps, we can conclude that it is possible for both Tom and Jen to have watched different sports. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",
