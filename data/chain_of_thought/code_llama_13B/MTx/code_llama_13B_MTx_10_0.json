Modus tollens is a rule that states \"if p implies q and not-q, then not-p.\" In this case, premise 1 states that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled, and premise 2 states that the wug was not garpled. Therefore, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged using modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
