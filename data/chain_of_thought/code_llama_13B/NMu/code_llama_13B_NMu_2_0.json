This implies that there is a possibility that the griffin did not have to be in the forest, but we don't know for sure.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"the griffin might not have been in the forest\" from the statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\" The statement only tells us that it is not true that the griffin must have been in the forest, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: No",
