In this case, the statement asserts that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether we can infer \"the alien might not have visited Mars\" from the given statement.\n\n* The inference is possible because the negation of a proposition does not necessarily mean that the opposite of the proposition is true. In this case, the negation of \"the alien must have visited Mars\" means that it is not necessary for the alien to have visited Mars, but it does not imply that the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, we can infer that \"the alien might not have visited Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
