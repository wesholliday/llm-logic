This does not necessarily mean that they might not be in her bag, as there could still be other possibilities.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the analysis of the statement, we cannot infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag from \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\" Therefore, the answer is no.",
