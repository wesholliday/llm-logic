This does not necessarily mean that Mary might not have been at the wedding, as there could be other reasons why she was not at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the analysis above, we cannot infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding from the statement \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\" Therefore, the answer is no.",
