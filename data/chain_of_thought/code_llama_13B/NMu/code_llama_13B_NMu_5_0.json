This does not necessarily mean that Jeff might not have played basketball, as there could be other reasons why he did not play basketball.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis above, we cannot infer \"Jeff might not have played basketball\" from the statement \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball.\" The statement only tells us that it is not true that Jeff must have played basketball, but it does not provide any information about whether he did or did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: No",
