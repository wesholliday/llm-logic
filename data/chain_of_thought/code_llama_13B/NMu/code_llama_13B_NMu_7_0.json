This implies that Alex might not have finished the race, but we cannot say for certain whether he did or did not finish the race.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on our analysis, we can infer \"Alex might not have finished the race\" from the statement \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
