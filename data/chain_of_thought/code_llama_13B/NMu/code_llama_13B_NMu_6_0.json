This does not necessarily mean that she might not have chosen pizza, as there could be other reasons why she did not choose pizza.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis above, we cannot infer \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" from the statement \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\" The statement only implies that it is possible for Sue to have not chosen pizza, but it does not provide any additional information about her choice.\n\nAnswer: No",
