This does not necessarily mean that the shoes might not be in the closet, as there could still be other possibilities.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"the shoes might not be in the closet\" from the statement \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\" Therefore, the answer is no.",
