This means that it could be doing something else, such as napping on the couch.\n\nStep 2: The second statement says that either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom. This implies that if the cat is not napping on the couch, then it must be playing in the bedroom.\n\nStep 3: Based on these two statements, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch. The first statement suggests that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, which means that it could be doing something else. The second statement then implies that if the cat is not napping on the couch, then it must be playing in the bedroom. Therefore, we can conclude that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
