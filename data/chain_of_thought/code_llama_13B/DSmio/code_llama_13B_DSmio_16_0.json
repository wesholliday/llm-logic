In this case, the conclusion is \"The pen is in my bag\" and the premise is \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is valid, we need to check whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premise \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" implies that the pen is either in my bag or on my desk, but it does not exclude the possibility that the pen is not in my bag and not on my desk. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
