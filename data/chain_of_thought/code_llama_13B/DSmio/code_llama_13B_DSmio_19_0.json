In this case, the conclusion is \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" and the premise is \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid.\n\nTo determine whether the argument is valid, we need to check whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premise \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" implies that the watch is either charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist, but it does not exclude the possibility that the watch is neither charging on the dresser nor on his wrist. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
