In this case, the conclusion \"The newspaper is in the driveway\" logically follows from the premise \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid.\n\nThe argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and there are no logical fallacies or contradictions in the argument. Therefore, we can infer that \"The newspaper is in the driveway\" based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
