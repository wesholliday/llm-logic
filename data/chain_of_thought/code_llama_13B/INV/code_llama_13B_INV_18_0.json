The conclusion is \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. The argument is invalid because it is based on a false premise. If the doll was plastic, it does not necessarily follow that the truck was metal. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
