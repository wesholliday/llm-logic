The conclusion is \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. The argument is invalid because it is based on a false premise. If the shirt was cotton, it does not necessarily follow that the pants are denim. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
