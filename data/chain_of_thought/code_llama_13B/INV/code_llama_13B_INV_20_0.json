This is because if the apple is not red, then it must be some other color (e.g., green or orange). Since the banana is yellow, and the apple is not red, we can conclude that the banana is not yellow either.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on our analysis, we can infer that \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
