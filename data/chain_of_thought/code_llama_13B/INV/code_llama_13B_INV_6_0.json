The conclusion is \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. To evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In this case, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. For example, if Sue chose pizza and Bob chose pasta, but then Sue changed her mind and decided not to eat pizza, it is possible that Bob still chose pasta. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
