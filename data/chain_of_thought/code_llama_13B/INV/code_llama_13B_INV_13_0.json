The conclusion is \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument. To evaluate the validity of the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Analyze the premise and conclusion. The premise states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This means that if the car is not red, then it cannot be inferred that the truck is blue. Therefore, the conclusion \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" logically follows from the premise.\n\nStep 5: Conclude whether the argument is valid or invalid. Based on our analysis, we can conclude that the argument is valid. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: yes'.",
