The conclusion is \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument. We can infer that the conclusion follows from the premise if we assume that Sam and Erin are taking transportation to the same destination. If they are not taking transportation to the same destination, then it is possible for one of them to take a plane while the other takes a train.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the argument based on the given information. We cannot infer that the conclusion follows from the premise without additional information about Sam and Erin's destinations. Therefore, we cannot say with certainty whether the conclusion follows from the premise or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
