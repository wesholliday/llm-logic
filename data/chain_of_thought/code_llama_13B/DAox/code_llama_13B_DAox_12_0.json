Modus tollens is a rule that states \"if p implies q and not-p, then not-q.\" In this case, premise 1 states that the smip was not shripped, which implies that the smip did not lup the zoint (premise 2). Since we know that the smip did not lup the zoint, we can conclude that the smip did not lup the zoint.\n\nAnswer: yes",
