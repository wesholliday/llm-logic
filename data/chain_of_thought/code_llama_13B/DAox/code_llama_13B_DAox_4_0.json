Modus tollens is a rule that states \"if p implies q and not-q, then not-p.\" In this case, the premises are:\n\n1. The fribble was not snurgled (not-p)\n2. If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked (p implies q)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the fribble did not crink (not-q).\n\nAnswer: yes",
