This means that the splat did not undergo any changes in its shape or form.\n* The second statement states that if the splat was morphed, then it would quank. However, this does not necessarily mean that the splat quanked. It only means that if the splat was morphed, then it would experience a change in its state of being.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions.\n\n* Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"the splat did not quank.\" The fact that the splat was not morphed does not necessarily mean that it did not quank. It is possible that the splat quanked without undergoing any changes in its shape or form.\n\nAnswer: No",
