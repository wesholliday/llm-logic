Therefore, we cannot infer that the sprocket was daggled based on this information alone.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\n\n* Based on our analysis and evaluation of the information provided, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was not daggled\" from \"The sprocket was not cranked\" and \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: no.\"",
