However, the first statement states that the flugel might not have been zargled, which means that it cannot be assumed to have been zargled. Therefore, we can conclude that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\n\n* Based on our analysis, we can infer that \"The flugel was not blimmed\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
