The statement \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggered\" does not necessarily mean that the sprocket was not cranked. It only means that if the sprocket was cranked, it would have been daggered.\n* Therefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
