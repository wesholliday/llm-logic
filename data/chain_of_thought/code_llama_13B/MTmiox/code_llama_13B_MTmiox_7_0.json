This means that it is possible that the whiffle did not make a sound.\n* If we assume that the second sentence is true, then we know that if the whiffle was shanked (i.e., it made a sound), then it must have tinked. This means that if the whiffle did not make a sound, then it cannot be said to have been shanked.\n* Therefore, from the given information, we can infer that \"the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
