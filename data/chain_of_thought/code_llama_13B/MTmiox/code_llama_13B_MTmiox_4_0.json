In this case, the first statement (Premise 1) is the hypothesis or the assumption, and the second statement (Premise 2) is the conclusion or the implication. The conclusion logically follows from the hypothesis if the hypothesis is true.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nThe argument is invalid because it is based on a false premise. The assumption that the fribble was snurgled is not necessarily true, and therefore the conclusion that the fribble must have crinked does not logically follow from this assumption.\n\nAnswer: No",
