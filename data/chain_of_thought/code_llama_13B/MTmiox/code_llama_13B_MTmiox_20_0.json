The second statement says \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\" This means that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the information.\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" because we don't know for sure whether the fleeg was bluttered or not. The first statement only says that it might not have been surned, which doesn't provide any information about whether the fleeg was bluttered or not. The second statement only states a logical consequence of being bluttered and surned, but it does not provide any evidence that the fleeg was actually bluttered.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\" Answer: No.",
