This is because if the smip was shripped, then it must have been lifted (i.e., stripped) in order to be shripped.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"The smip was not shripped\" from \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\" This is because the first statement does not necessarily imply that the smip was not stripped. It only implies that it did not necessarily lup the zoint.\n\nAnswer: No",
