The statement only states that if the apple is red, then the banana will be yellow. It does not provide any information about what happens when the banana is yellow and the apple is not red.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on our analysis, we cannot infer that \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\" This statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the answer is 'No'.",
