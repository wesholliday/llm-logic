This means that if we know that Mary was at the wedding, we can conclude that Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe conclusion is \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the premise, as it states that if Sue was at the wedding, we can conclude that Mary was also at the wedding. Therefore, the conclusion follows from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on our analysis, we can infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" from \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.",
