The conclusion is \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the premise and conclusion. The premise and conclusion are not logically equivalent because they have different directions of implication. In the premise, if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. However, in the conclusion, if the muffins are blueberry, it does not necessarily follow that the cake is chocolate. Therefore, we cannot infer the conclusion from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
