The statement only states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. It does not provide any information about what happens when the truck is blue and the car is not red.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on our analysis, we cannot infer that \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\" This statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the answer is no.",
