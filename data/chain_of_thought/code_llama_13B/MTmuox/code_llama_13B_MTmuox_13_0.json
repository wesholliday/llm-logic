We need more information to determine whether or not the glip was slogged.\n\nStep 3: Conclude.\n\n* Based on the given information and our reasoning, we cannot infer \"The glip was not slogged\" from \"It's not the case that the glip must have tragged\" together with \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged\". Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No",
