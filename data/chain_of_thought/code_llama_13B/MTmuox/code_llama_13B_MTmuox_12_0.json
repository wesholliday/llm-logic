In this case, we can apply modus tollens by assuming that the premise \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint\" is true, and its negation \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint\" is false.\n\nStep 3: Deduce the conclusion.\n\nFrom premise 2, we can deduce that if the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint. Therefore, if the negation of premise 1 is true (i.e., \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint\" is false), we can conclude that the smip was shripped.\n\nStep 4: Check the conclusion against the given information.\n\nWe are asked to infer whether the smip was shripped or not. Based on our deduction, we can conclude that if \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint\" is false (i.e., the premise 1 is true), then the smip was shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
