However, this does not necessarily mean that the wug was not flooped. The second premise only states that if the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint. It does not provide any information about whether or not the wug was flooped.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The wug was not flooped\" from the given premises alone. The argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
