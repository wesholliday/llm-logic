In this case, we are given the premise \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\" We can apply modus tollens by assuming that the whiffle was not shanked (i.e., P is false), and then concluding that the whiffle did not tink (Q is false).\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\nBased on the premises and the application of modus tollens, we can conclude that \"The whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
