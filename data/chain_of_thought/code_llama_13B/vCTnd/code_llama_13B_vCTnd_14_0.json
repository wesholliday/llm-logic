This means that the conclusion must be true, regardless of whether the meal was prepared carefully or not. However, the conclusion states that if the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared. This is a contradiction, as the premise and conclusion cannot both be true at the same time. Therefore, this form of argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: no",
