Premise 1 is logically valid because it states that if something is true, then its opposite must be false. In this case, if I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal.\n2. Premise 2 is also logically valid because it states that if something is true, then its opposite must be false. In this case, if I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\n3. The conclusion follows logically from the premises because if I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal (from Premise 2), and if I did not eat a meal (from Premise 1), then I did not eat a large meal (from Premise 2).\n\nTherefore, the form of argument is logically valid.
