Premise 1 states that if Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously. This means that if Ann did exercise, it is not necessarily the case that she exercised strenuously.\n2. Premise 2 states that if Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise. This means that if Ann exercised strenuously, it is not necessary for her to have exercised at all.\n3. The conclusion logically follows from the premises. If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise. Therefore, the conclusion is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
