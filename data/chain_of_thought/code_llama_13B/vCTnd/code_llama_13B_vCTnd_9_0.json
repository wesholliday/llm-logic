The conclusion logically follows from the premise, but it does not necessarily mean that the premise is true. In other words, just because the conclusion is true, it does not mean that the premise is also true.\n\nTo see why this argument is invalid, let's consider a counterexample. Suppose we have instructions for a task, and we follow them carefully. If we do so, then we can conclude that the instructions were explained clearly because we followed them without any problems. However, it does not necessarily mean that the instructions were given in the first place.\n\nTherefore, this argument is logically invalid because it assumes that the conclusion follows from the premise, but it does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
