The conclusion logically follows from the premise, but it does not necessarily mean that the premise is true. In other words, just because the conclusion is true, it does not mean that the premise is also true.\n\nTo see why this argument is invalid, let's consider a counterexample. Suppose we are given directions to a location, and we follow them carefully. However, despite our best efforts, we still end up lost. In this case, it is clear that the directions were not explained clearly, but they were still provided. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument (that if directions were explained clearly, then they were not provided) does not logically follow from the premise (if directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly).\n\nIn summary, this argument is invalid because it affirms the consequent, which means that it assumes that the conclusion is true without providing any evidence to support that assumption.
