Premise 1 is a contradiction, which means that it cannot be true.\n2. Premise 2 is also a contradiction, which means that it cannot be true.\n3. Therefore, both premises are false, and the conclusion must also be false.\n4. The argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premises through logical reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes",
