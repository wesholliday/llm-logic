This statement is a logical contradiction and can be proven by using the law of non-contradiction.\n\nStep 2: Premise 2 is also true because it states that if someone exercises much, they do not exercise. This statement is also a logical contradiction and can be proven by using the law of non-contradiction.\n\nStep 3: The conclusion follows logically from the premises because if Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise according to Premise 2. Therefore, the conclusion that If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
