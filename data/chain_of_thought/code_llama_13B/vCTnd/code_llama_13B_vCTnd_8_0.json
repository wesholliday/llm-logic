This means that if the issue was addressed at all, it must have been done ineffectively. However, the conclusion states that if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed. This creates a logical contradiction, as the argument is trying to say that something cannot be both effective and ineffective at the same time.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",
