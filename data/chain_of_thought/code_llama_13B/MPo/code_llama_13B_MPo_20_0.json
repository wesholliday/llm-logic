In this case, the first statement (the premise) is \"If the apple was red,\" and the second statement (the conclusion) is \"Then the banana was yellow.\" The relationship between these two statements is that if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows a logical pattern of conditional reasoning. The premise states a condition (the apple being red), and the conclusion states what happens if that condition is true (the banana being yellow). Therefore, the argument is valid because it provides a logical explanation for why the banana must be yellow if the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
