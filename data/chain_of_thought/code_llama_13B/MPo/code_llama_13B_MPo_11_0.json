It means that if the cake was chocolate, then it follows that the muffins were blueberry. However, this does not necessarily mean that the muffins were blueberry just because the cake was chocolate.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the analysis.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"The muffins were blueberry\" from \"The cake was chocolate.\" The conditional statement only provides a possible connection between the two statements, but it does not guarantee that the muffins were blueberry just because the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No",
