In this case, the first statement (Premise 1) is the hypothesis or antecedent, and the second statement (Premise 2) is the conclusion or consequent. The relationship between these two statements is \"if...then.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nTo determine whether an argument is valid or invalid, we need to consider whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion (Premise 2) does not logically follow from the premises (Premise 1). Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
