In this case, the relationship is \"if-then.\" The first statement (Premise 1) states that the alien visited Mars, and the second statement (Premise 2) states that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows a logical relationship between two statements. The first statement (Premise 1) is true, and the second statement (Premise 2) logically follows from the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the robot visited Jupiter based on the premises provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
