The second premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the argument.\nTo determine whether we can infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from the given premises, we need to examine the validity of the second premise. Is it a logical conclusion based on the information provided in the first premise?\n\nStep 3: Analyze the second premise.\nThe second premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This statement is not necessarily true because there could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding, such as she was a guest of Mary or she was invited by someone else. Therefore, we cannot infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from the given premises.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nBased on our analysis, we cannot infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from the given premises. Therefore, the answer is 'Answer: no'.",
