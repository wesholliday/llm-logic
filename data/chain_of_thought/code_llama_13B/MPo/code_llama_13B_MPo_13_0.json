In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n\nTo evaluate the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. In other words, we need to determine whether it is possible for the conclusion to be true without the premises being true.\n\nStep 3: Determine the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe conclusion \"The truck was blue\" does not follow logically from the premise \"The car was red.\" In fact, it is possible for the conclusion to be false even if the premise is true. For example, if the car was actually green, then the conclusion that the truck was blue would be false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The truck was blue\" from the premises \"The car was red\" and \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
