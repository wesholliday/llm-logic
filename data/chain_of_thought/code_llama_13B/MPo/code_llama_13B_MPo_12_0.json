In this case, the second premise is a conditional statement that states \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This means that if Joe did go to the park, then it is logically necessary that Lucy also went to the zoo.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe conclusion we are asked to evaluate is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" To determine if this conclusion follows from the premises, we need to examine whether or not it is logically possible for Lucy to have gone to the zoo based on the information provided in the premises. In this case, since the second premise states that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, and we know that Joe did go to the park, it is logically necessary that Lucy also went to the zoo. Therefore, the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
