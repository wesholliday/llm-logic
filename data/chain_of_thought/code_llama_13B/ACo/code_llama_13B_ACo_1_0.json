The second piece of information tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding. However, we are not given any information about whether Mary was actually at the wedding or not.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding. The fact that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. We only know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would also be there.\n\nStep 5: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding from the information provided.",
