In this case, the condition is \"the book was written by James.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nThe argument is valid because it is a correct application of modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement (premise 2) is true and its antecedent (premise 1) is also true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, premise 1 is \"the book is a mystery novel,\" and premise 2 is \"if the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" Therefore, if we assume that the book was written by James (premise 1), then we can conclude that the book is a mystery novel (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: yes",
