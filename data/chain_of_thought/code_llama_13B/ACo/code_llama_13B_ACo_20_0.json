In this case, the antecedent is \"The apple was red,\" and the consequent is \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether we can infer \"The apple was red\" from the given information.\n\n* Based on the conditional statement, we cannot infer that \"The apple was red\" because the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is not true. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
