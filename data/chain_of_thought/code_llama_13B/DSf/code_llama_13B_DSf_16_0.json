We can't infer anything about the location of the pen from this statement alone.\n\nStep 3:\nFrom the second statement, we know that the pen isn't on my desk. This means that if the pen were on my desk, then the first statement would be false. Therefore, we can conclude that the pen is not on my desk.\n\nStep 4:\nSince we have established that the pen is not on my desk, and we know that either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag, we can infer that the pen must be in my bag. Therefore, the answer to our question is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
