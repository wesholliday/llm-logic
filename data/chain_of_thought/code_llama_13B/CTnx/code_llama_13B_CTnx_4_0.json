This means that if we know that a fribble is snurgled, we can conclude that it does not crink.\n\nStep 3: Apply the given information to the question.\nIf we assume that \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink,\" and we want to know whether we can infer \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled,\" we need to see if the opposite of the given information is true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion.\nThe opposite of \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\" is \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was snurgled.\" This means that if we know that a fribble crinks, it does not necessarily mean that it was not snurgled.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on our analysis, we cannot infer \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" from \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\" Therefore, the answer is no.",
