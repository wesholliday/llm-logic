If the flugel was zargled, it is not blimmed. Therefore, we can infer that if the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\nBased on our analysis, we can infer \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.",
