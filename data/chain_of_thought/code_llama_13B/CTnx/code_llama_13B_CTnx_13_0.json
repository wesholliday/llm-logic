This means that if something is slogged, it cannot be tragged.\n\nStep 3: Apply the given information to the question.\nTo infer \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged\", we need to apply the given information in reverse. If something is tragged, it cannot be slogged. Therefore, we can conclude that if the glip was tragged, then it was not slogged.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: yes",
