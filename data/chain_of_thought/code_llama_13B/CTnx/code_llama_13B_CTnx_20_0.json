If a fleeg surns, it would not have been bluttered. Therefore, we can infer that if a fleeg surns, it was not bluttered.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\nBased on our analysis and application of the logic, we can infer \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.",
