This means that if the shank was plooked (i.e., it was looked at), then it was not nugged (i.e., it was not eaten).\n\nStep 3: Apply logic to the given information.\nWe can infer \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" from \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged\". This is because if the shank was nugged (i.e., it was eaten), then it was not plooked (i.e., it was not looked at).\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" from \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged\". Answer: yes.",
