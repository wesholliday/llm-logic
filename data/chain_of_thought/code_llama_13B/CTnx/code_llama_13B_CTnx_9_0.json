This means that the opposite of the first statement is \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the two statements are logically equivalent.\nThe two statements are logically equivalent because they have the same logical relationship between the antecedent and consequent. Both statements imply that if the twonk was plinked or not plinked, then it was varnished or not varnished, respectively.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: yes",
