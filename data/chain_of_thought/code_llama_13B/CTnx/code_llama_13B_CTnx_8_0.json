This does not necessarily mean that if a sprocket is daggled, it is not cranked.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" from \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\" The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: No",
