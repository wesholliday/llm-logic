This means that if a flug is blummed, it is not zimmed.\n\nStep 3: Apply logic to the situation.\nWe can infer \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" from \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed\". This is because if a flug is blummed, it is not zimmed, and if a flug is zimmed, it is not blummed.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: yes",
