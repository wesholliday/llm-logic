It only means that if it were cranked, it would be daggled.\n\nStep 3: Consider the given information again.\n\n* We are told that \"The sprocket was cranked.\" This means that the sprocket was indeed cranked.\n* However, we do not know whether or not the sprocket was actually daggled. It could have been cranked without being daggled.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the information provided, it is not possible to infer that \"The sprocket was daggled\" from \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" together with \"The sprocket was cranked.\"\n* Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: no.\"",
