(This is a conditional statement.)\n\t+ The shank was plooked. (This is a fact.)\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the information provided.\n\n* Based on the given information, we can infer that \"The shank was nugged\" because \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\" and \"The shank was plooked.\" This is a valid inference because the conditional statement implies that if the antecedent (the first part of the statement) is true, then the consequent (the second part of the statement) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
