This means that the two statements are related in some way.\n* The second piece of information states that a glip was slogged. This means that we have evidence that a glip was slogged.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions.\n\n* Based on the information provided, we can infer that the glip was tragged. This is because the first statement implies that if a glip is slogged, it will be tragged, and we have evidence that a glip was slogged. Therefore, we can conclude that the glip was tragged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
