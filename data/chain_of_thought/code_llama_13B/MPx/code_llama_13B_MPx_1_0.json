This means that if we know that the flugel was blimmed, we can infer that it was also zargled.\n* The second statement simply states that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the information provided, we can infer that the flugel was zargled because if the flugel was blimmed, then it was also zargled. Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: yes.\"",
