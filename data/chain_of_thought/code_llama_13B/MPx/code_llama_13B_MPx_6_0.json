If the first statement were true, then we could infer that the grommet plopped the frink based on the second statement. However, since we do not know whether the first statement is true or false, we cannot make any conclusions about whether \"The grommet plopped the frink\" can be inferred from the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
