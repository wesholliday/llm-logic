Instead, it uses the word \"then\" to indicate that the second event follows the first event.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the statement based on the given information.\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed.\" This is because the statement does not provide any information about the relationship between the two events. It only states that the second event follows the first event.\n\nAnswer: no",
