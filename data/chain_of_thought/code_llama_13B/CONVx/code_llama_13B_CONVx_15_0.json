However, we are not told whether the dreb is actually vroombed or not.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed\" from \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This is because we are not given any information about whether the dreb is actually vroombed or not. Therefore, we cannot make a conclusion about whether the dreb was vroombed or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
