This means that if something is made springy or bouncy, it will also become garbled or unclear.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether we can infer the opposite of the premise from the conclusion.\n\n* No, we cannot infer that if the wug was garpled, then it was sproinged. This is because the two verbs have different meanings and do not necessarily follow a logical pattern.\n\nAnswer: no",
