This means that there is a causal relationship between being plinked and being varnished. However, we do not know whether the relationship is one-way or two-way.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nTo infer \"If the twonk was varnished, then it was plinked,\" we would need to know that being varnished implies being plinked. However, this is not explicitly stated in the given information. Therefore, we cannot infer this statement from the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
