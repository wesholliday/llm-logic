This means that the smonk's deformation caused it to become plagued.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether we can infer the opposite of the given statement.\n\nWe cannot infer that if the smonk plagged, then it was vreebled. The relationship between the two statements is not symmetric, as the deformation of the smonk caused its plague, but the reverse is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
