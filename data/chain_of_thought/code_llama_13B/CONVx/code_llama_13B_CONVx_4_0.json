The premise only states that if the fribble was snurgled, it would crinkle, but it does not state that if the fribble crinkles, it must have been snurgled.\n\nStep 3: Conclude whether or not we can infer the conclusion from the premise.\nBased on the reasoning above, we cannot infer \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\" from \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: no.\"",
