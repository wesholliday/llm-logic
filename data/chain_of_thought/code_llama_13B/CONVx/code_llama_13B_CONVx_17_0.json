This means that if the flob is skizzled, it will move. However, we are not told whether the flob moves when it is not skizzled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was skizzled\". This is because we do not know whether the flob moves when it is not skizzled. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if the flob moves, it must have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: No",
