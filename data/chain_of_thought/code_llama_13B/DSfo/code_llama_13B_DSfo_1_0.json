However, we also know that either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside. This means that if Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside. Therefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on our analysis of the information, we can conclude that from \"Fido is not in the garden\" together with \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside,\" we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
