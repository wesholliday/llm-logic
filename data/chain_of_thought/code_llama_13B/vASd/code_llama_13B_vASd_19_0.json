The premise states that if you fill up the gas tank, the car will run. This means that there must be enough fuel in the tank for the car to run.\n2. The conclusion states that if you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run. This means that even though there is a hole in the tank, as long as there is still enough fuel in the tank, the car will run.\n3. However, this conclusion does not follow from the premise. If there is a hole in the gas tank, then there may not be enough fuel in the tank to run the car. In other words, the presence of a hole in the tank does not guarantee that the car will run.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premise. Answer: no",
