In this case, it is \"if-then.\"\n\nStep 2: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. To do this, we need to analyze the conclusion and determine if it is a valid implication of the premise.\n\nStep 3: The conclusion states that if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue. This statement is not necessarily true, as there may be other reasons why the services would continue even if the check bounces. For example, the customer may have a backup payment method or the service provider may have a policy of allowing customers to continue using their services even if they are unable to pay their bill.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, the conclusion is not logically valid because it does not necessarily follow from the premise. The argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
