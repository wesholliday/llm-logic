However, the conclusion of the argument is \"If I exercise and eat junk food, I will lose weight,\" which is a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent.\n\nThe affirming the consequent fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because something has happened (in this case, eating junk food), it must have caused another event to happen (losing weight). However, this assumption does not necessarily follow from the available evidence and is therefore a logical fallacy.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically invalid. Answer: no",
