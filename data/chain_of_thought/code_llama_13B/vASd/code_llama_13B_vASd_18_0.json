This statement is a causal relationship between the action of watering the plants and their growth. However, it does not specify the conditions under which this relationship holds true.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the conclusion.\nThe conclusion states that if I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow. This statement is a causal relationship between the actions of watering the plants and providing no sunlight, and their growth. However, it does not specify the conditions under which this relationship holds true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the argument.\nThe argument is logically valid because it establishes a causal relationship between the actions of watering the plants and providing no sunlight, and their growth. The conclusion follows logically from the premise based on the assumption that there is no sunlight. However, it does not provide any additional information about the conditions under which this relationship holds true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
