The conclusion of the argument is \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\"\n3. To determine if this form of argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and the conclusion.\n4. The conclusion states that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A. This implies that the student will not get an A if the essay is well-written but not turned in late.\n5. However, the premise only states that if the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A. It does not mention anything about the deadline or whether the essay was turned in on time.\n6. Therefore, the conclusion is logically valid because it follows from the premise. The argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
