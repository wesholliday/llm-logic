However, this does not necessarily mean that the package will not arrive at all. It may still be delivered to a different location or to someone else who can forward it to its original recipient.\n\nStep 3: Based on Steps 1 and 2, we can conclude that if the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it is likely that it will arrive today. This conclusion logically follows from the premises because the delivery service is responsible for delivering packages on time, and since the package was misrouted, it may still be delivered to a different location or to someone else who can forward it to its original recipient.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
