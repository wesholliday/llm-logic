In this case, the major premise is \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired,\" and the minor premise is \"Doing hard labor will make you tired.\" The conclusion is \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\"\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the validity of the argument.\nThe argument is logically valid because it follows a correct logical structure and uses valid reasoning methods. The major premise states that if you get enough sleep, you will not be tired, which is a universal affirmative statement (i.e., all A's are B's). The minor premise states that doing hard labor will make you tired, which is also a universal affirmative statement. The conclusion logically follows from the major and minor premises because it is a logical consequence of them.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
