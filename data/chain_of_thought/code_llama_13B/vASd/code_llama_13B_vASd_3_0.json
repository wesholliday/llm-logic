In this case, the logical connective is \"if-then.\"\n\nStep 2: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. To do this, we need to examine the relationship between the two statements.\n\nStep 3: The conclusion states that the car is safe even though the garage is flooding. This contradicts the premise, which states that the car is safe only when it is in the garage. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
