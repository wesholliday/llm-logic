The conclusion states that the lawn will be lush and green even in the presence of a drought, which is not necessarily true. Fertilizing the lawn may help it to grow in the absence of rain, but it will not make it lush and green during a drought.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
