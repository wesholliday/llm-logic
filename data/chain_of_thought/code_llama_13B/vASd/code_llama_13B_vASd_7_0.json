This means that if the oven is not on, then it cannot be inferred that the kitchen is warm.\n\nStep 2: The conclusion states that if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm. This means that if the oven is on and the pilot light is in, then it can be inferred that the kitchen is warm.\n\nStep 3: The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then it cannot be inferred that the kitchen is warm based solely on the premise. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
