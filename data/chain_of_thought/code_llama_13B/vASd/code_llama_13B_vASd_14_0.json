The premise states that if you study hard, you will pass the test, but the conclusion states that if you study hard and the test is in Chinese, you will pass the test. This implies that studying hard is sufficient to pass the test regardless of the language it is written in, which is not necessarily true.\n\nFor example, if the test is in English and you are not fluent in the language, studying hard may not be enough to help you pass the test even if you know the material well. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, and the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
