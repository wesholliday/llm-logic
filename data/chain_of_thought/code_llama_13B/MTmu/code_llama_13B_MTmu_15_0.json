However, this does not necessarily mean that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nStep 3: The second statement tells us that it is not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that Erin may or may not have taken a train, but we do not know for sure.\n\nStep 4: Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane. The first statement does not provide enough information to make this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: No",
