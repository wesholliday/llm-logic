This means that if the doll was plastic, then it follows that the truck must be metal.\n\nStep 2: However, we are also given the information that \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\" This contradicts the first statement and implies that the truck is not necessarily metal.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, we cannot infer that the doll was not plastic from the given information. The only thing we can say for sure is that the truck is not necessarily metal.\n\nAnswer: No",
