However, this does not necessarily mean that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" from the statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest.\" The statement only implies that it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest, but it does not necessarily mean that the griffin did not have to be in the forest.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" from the statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest.\"",
