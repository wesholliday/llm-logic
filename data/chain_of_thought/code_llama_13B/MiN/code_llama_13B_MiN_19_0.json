It could be that the watch is not charging on the dresser or it could be that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser\" from the statement \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser.\" The statement does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about whether or not the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: no",
