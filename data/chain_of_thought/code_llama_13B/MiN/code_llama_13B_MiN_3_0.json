The negation only states that it's not the case that the book was written by James, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that the book was written by someone else or that the authorship is unknown. Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" from \"The book might not have been written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
