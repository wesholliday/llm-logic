Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\"\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the information provided and our analysis, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" from the statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No",
