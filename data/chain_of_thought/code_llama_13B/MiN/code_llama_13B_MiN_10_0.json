(original sentence)\n* It must not have been inside. (sentence with negated \"might\")\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the negated sentence is logically equivalent to the original sentence.\n\n* The negation of \"might\" in this case is \"must not,\" which means that the dog did not enter the house. Therefore, the negated sentence \"It must not have been inside\" implies that the dog did not enter the house, which is logically equivalent to the original sentence \"The dog might not have been inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
