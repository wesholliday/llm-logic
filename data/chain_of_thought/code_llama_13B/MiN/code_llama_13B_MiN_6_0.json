Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" from the statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\" Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No",
