This does not necessarily mean that the shoes must not be in the closet, as there could be other reasons why they are not there.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nBased on the statement \"The shoes might not be in the closet,\" we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\" This is because the statement does not provide enough information to make a definitive conclusion about whether or not the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: No",
