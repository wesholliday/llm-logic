This means that there is no evidence to suggest that the wug was definitely sproinged.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\n\n* Can we infer from the premise that the wug might not have been sproinged? Yes, we can. The absence of evidence for a certain event does not necessarily mean that it did not happen. It is possible that there was no evidence to suggest that the wug was sproinged because it did not actually occur.\n\nAnswer: yes",
