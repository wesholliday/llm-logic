This means that there is no guarantee that the clug was fleeked.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\n\n* Can we infer \"The clug might not have been fleeked\" from the premise? Yes, we can. The premise states that it is not the case that the clug must have been fleeked, which means that there is no guarantee that the clug was fleeked. Therefore, we can conclude that the clug might not have been fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
