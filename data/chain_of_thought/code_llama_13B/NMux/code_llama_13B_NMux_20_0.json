This means that there is no evidence to suggest that the fleeg was definitely bluttered.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\n\n* Can we infer from the premise that the fleeg might not have been bluttered? Yes, we can. The fact that it is not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered means that there is no evidence to suggest that the fleeg was definitely bluttered, which implies that the possibility of the fleeg not having been bluttered exists. Therefore, we can infer \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" from \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
