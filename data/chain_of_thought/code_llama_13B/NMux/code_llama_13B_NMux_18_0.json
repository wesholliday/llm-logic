This means that there is no obligation for the shank to have been plooked, but it does not necessarily mean that it was not plooked.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\n\n* The conclusion is \"The shank might not have been plooked.\" This statement implies that there is a possibility that the shank was not plooked, which is consistent with the premise.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The shank might not have been plooked\" from \"It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked.\" Answer: yes.",
