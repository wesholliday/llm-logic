This means that there is no evidence to suggest that the wug was definitely flooped.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\n\n* Can we infer from the premise that the wug might not have been flooped? Yes, we can. The fact that it is not the case that the wug must have been flooped does not necessarily mean that the wug was definitely not flooped. It only means that there is no evidence to suggest that the wug was flooped. Therefore, we can infer that the wug might not have been flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
