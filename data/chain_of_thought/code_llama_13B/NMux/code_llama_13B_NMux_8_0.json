This implies that there is a possibility that the sprocket was not cranked, but we cannot be certain of this.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the analysis above, we can infer that \"The sprocket might not have been cranked\" from the statement \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been cranked.\" Therefore, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
