This means that there is no obligation or necessity for the sneg to have been crampled.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\n\n* Can we infer \"The sneg might not have been crampled\" from the premise? Yes, we can. The fact that it is not the case that the sneg must have been crampled means that there is no obligation or necessity for the sneg to have been crampled, which implies that the sneg might not have been crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
