This means that there is no obligation for the smip to be shipped, and it is possible that it was not shipped.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion.\n\n* Based on the premise, we can infer that \"The smip might not have been shripped.\" This is because there is no obligation for the smip to be shipped, and it is possible that it was not shipped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
