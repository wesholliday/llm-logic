According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

Here we go!\n\nSo, according to financial advisors, the stock market is expected to have the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, and bonds will have significantly lower expected returns. This means that if real estate doesn't have the highest returns, then bonds will likely have even lower returns.\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that stocks don't have the highest returns. If this is the case, it means that real estate might actually have higher returns than stocks, since real estate is expected to have the second-highest returns. In this scenario, bonds would still have lower returns compared to both stocks and real estate.\n\nTherefore, if stocks don't have the highest returns, it is likely that bonds will still have lower returns compared to both stocks and real estate. This leads me to conclude that:\n\nAnswer: yes",
