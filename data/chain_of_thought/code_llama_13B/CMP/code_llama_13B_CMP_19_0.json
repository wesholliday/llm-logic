    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

Rents are expected to increase the most this year, followed by home prices, and mortgage rates will rise much less.\n2. If home prices don't increase the most, then mortgage rates will increase the most.\n3. Rents are likely to increase the most, so it is unlikely that home prices will increase the most.\n4. Therefore, if rents don't increase the most, it is likely that mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: yes",
