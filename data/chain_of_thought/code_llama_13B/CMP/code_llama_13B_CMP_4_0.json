The hiring manager thinks it\u2019s most likely Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, with Diego being a longshot. These are the only top candidates, so if Julian doesn\u2019t get the offer, then if Priya doesn\u2019t, Diego will. Moreover, it\u2019s likely Priya will get offered the role and hence that Julian won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if Priya doesn\u2019t get the offer, Diego will?",

The hiring manager thinks it's most likely that Priya will be offered the role, followed by Julian, and then Diego.\n2. If Priya doesn't get the offer, it's likely that Julian will get it instead.\n3. If neither Priya nor Julian gets the offer, then Diego has a chance.\n4. Therefore, if Priya doesn't get the offer, it's likely that Diego will get it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
