    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

Market research indicates that coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, and soda is consumed much less in the mornings.\n2. If tea doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, then soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n3. Coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, so tea is unlikely to retain the most morning drinkers.\n4. Therefore, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, it is likely that soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nAnswer: yes",
