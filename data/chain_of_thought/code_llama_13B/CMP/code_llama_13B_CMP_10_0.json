    "user_prompt": "Suppose that spring, summer, and winter are the most popular travel seasons. Forecasts show it's likely most vacations this year will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with many fewer happening in the winter. These are by far the top seasons, so if summer doesn't have the most vacations, then if spring doesn't, winter will. Moreover, spring likely will have the most travelers and hence summer likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, winter will?",

Forecasts show that this year, most vacations will happen in spring, followed closely by summer, with fewer happening in winter.\n3. If summer doesn't have the most vacations, then winter will.\n4. Spring is likely to have the most travelers, so summer is unlikely to have the most vacations.\n5. Therefore, if spring doesn't have the most vacations, it's likely that winter will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
