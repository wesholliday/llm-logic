Publishing data indicates thrillers will likely be the #1 genre this year, followed closely by romances, with mysteries far behind. These genres lead the market, so if romances aren\u2019t #1, then if thrillers aren\u2019t, mysteries will be. Moreover, thrillers likely will lead sales and hence romances likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if thrillers aren\u2019t #1, mysteries will be?",

This means that if thrillers aren't #1, then romances probably will be.\n\nSecondly, we know that thrillers will lead sales, so if thrillers aren't #1, it's unlikely that romances will be. This is because if thrillers are not selling well, it's less likely that romances will be selling well either.\n\nLastly, we know that if thrillers aren't #1, then mysteries will be. This is because mysteries are the only other genre that has a chance of being #1 if thrillers and romances are not.\n\nSo, based on these premises, it follows that if thrillers aren't #1, then mysteries will likely be #1.\n\nAnswer: yes \ud83d\ude0a",
