    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

Doctors expect the flu to infect the most patients this season, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind.\n2. If colds don't infect the most people, then strep will.\n3. Flu likely will infect the most people, so colds won't.\n\nNow, let me think... Hmmm... Okay, I've got it!\n\nAnswer: no.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\nThe argument is saying that if flu doesn't infect the most people, then strep will. However, this is based on the assumption that colds won't infect the most people if flu doesn't. But we don't know that for sure! It's possible that colds could still infect the most people even if flu doesn't. Therefore, it's not necessarily true that strep will infect the most people if flu doesn't.\n\nSo, the answer is no.",
