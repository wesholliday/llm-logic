    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides.\n2. If Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then taxis will give the most rides.\n3. Uber likely will give the most rides, so Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides.\n4. Therefore, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, it is likely that taxis will give the most rides.\n\nAnswer: yes",
