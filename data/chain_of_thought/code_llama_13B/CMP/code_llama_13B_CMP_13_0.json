    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "  Sure! I'll think step by step and explain my reasoning. Here we go!\n\nSo, let's break down the statement:\n\n1. Tennessee is projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US.\n2. Georgia is expected to add the second-most jobs, with Missouri's growth significantly lower.\n3. If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will.\n4. Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs, so Georgia is unlikely to add the most jobs.\n\nNow, let me think about the logical implications of these statements:\n\n1. If Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then it's likely that Georgia will add the most jobs, since Missouri's growth is significantly lower.\n2. However, if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will add the most jobs, since no other state has a higher projected job growth rate than Missouri.\n3. Therefore, if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, it's likely that Missouri will add the most jobs.\n\nAnswer: yes",
