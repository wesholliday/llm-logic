    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

If China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then India won't be either (since India's growth rate is expected to be higher than China's).\n3. Therefore, if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be (since Russia's growth rate is expected to be lower than both India and China's).\n\nSo, based on these premises, it follows that it is likely that if India isn't the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
