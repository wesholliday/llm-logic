This is because the information does not provide enough evidence to make such an inference.\n* In order to draw the conclusion that Sam did not take a plane, we would need more information or additional reasoning. For example, if we knew that Erin took a train and that Sam did not take a train, then we could infer that Sam did not take a plane. However, with the given information alone, we cannot make such an inference.\n\nAnswer: No",
