The first statement states that Jen did not watch basketball, while the second statement states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This does not necessarily mean that Tom did not watch football.\n\nStep 4: Conclude whether we can infer \"Tom did not watch football\" from the given information.\n\nNo, we cannot infer \"Tom did not watched football\" from the given information. The first statement only states that Jen did not watch basketball, while the second statement states a conditional relationship between Tom's actions and Jen's actions. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Tom did not watch football based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
