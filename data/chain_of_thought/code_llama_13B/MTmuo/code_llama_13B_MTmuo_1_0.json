            "content": "\nStep 1: We are given two statements:\n\n* \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n* \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n\nStep 2: We can see that the second statement is a conditional statement. The antecedent of the conditional (i.e., the part before the \"then\") is \"Mary was at the wedding.\" The consequent of the conditional (i.e., the part after the \"then\") is \"Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 3: We can also see that the first statement is a negation of the second statement. In other words, the first statement says that it is not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding, which means that she did not have to be there.\n\nStep 4: Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding. The reason for this is that the second statement only implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must also have been there. It does not say anything about what happens if Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
