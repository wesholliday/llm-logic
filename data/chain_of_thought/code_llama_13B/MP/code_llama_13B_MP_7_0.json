Alex finished the race.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the conclusion can be logically inferred from the premises.\nThe conclusion \"Chris finished the race\" cannot be logically inferred from the premises alone. The first premise states that if Alex finishes the race, then Chris will also finish the race. However, this does not necessarily mean that Chris will finish the race if Alex does not finish it. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Chris finished the race based solely on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
