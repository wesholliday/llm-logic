This means that if the first part of the statement (the antecedent) is true, then the second part of the statement (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: The antecedent of this statement is \"The cake was chocolate.\" Since we know that the cake was indeed chocolate, we can conclude that the antecedent is true.\n\nStep 3: Based on step 1 and step 2, we can infer that the consequent of the statement must also be true. In other words, if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
