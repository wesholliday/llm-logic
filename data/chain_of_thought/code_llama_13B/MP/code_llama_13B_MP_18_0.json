This means that if the doll was plastic, then it follows that the truck must be metal.\n\nStep 2: We are given that the doll is plastic. Therefore, we can infer that the doll is not metal.\n\nStep 3: Since the doll is not metal, and the statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement, it follows that the truck must be metal.\n\nTherefore, from the given information together with the statement \"The doll was plastic\", we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
