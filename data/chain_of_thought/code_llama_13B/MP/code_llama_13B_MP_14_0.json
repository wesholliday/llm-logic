This means that it is only true if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true.\n\nStep 2: We are given that the bear was in the cave. Therefore, we can infer that the antecedent of the conditional statement is true.\n\nStep 3: Since the antecedent is true, we can conclude that the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must also be true. In this case, the consequent is \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\nTherefore, from \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\" together with \"The bear was in the cave,\" we can infer that \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
