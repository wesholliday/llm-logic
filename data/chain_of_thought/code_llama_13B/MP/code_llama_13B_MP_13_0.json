This means that if the first part of the statement (the antecedent) is true, then the second part of the statement (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: In this case, the antecedent is \"The car was red.\" Since we know that the car was indeed red, we can conclude that the consequent must also be true, which is \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
