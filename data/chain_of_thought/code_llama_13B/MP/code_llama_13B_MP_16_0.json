This means that if the first part of the statement (the antecedent) is true, then the second part of the statement (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: The antecedent of this statement is \"The shirt was cotton.\" Since we know that the shirt was cotton, we can conclude that the first part of the statement is true.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, based on the conditional statement and the fact that the first part is true, we can infer that the second part must also be true. In other words, \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
