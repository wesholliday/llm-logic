            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the question.\nThe question is asking whether we can infer that \"Sue was at the wedding\" based on the premises \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the premises.\nBoth premises are true. The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This is a logical implication, as both statements are related to the same event (the wedding). The second premise simply states that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\nWe can use modus ponens to infer that \"Sue was at the wedding\" from the premises. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that states that if we have a statement and its logical consequence, then we can conclude that the logical consequence must be true. In this case, we have the premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and the premise \"Mary was at the wedding.\" We can use modus ponens to infer that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is a logical consequence of these premises.\n\nStep 4: Provide the answer.\nAnswer: yes",
