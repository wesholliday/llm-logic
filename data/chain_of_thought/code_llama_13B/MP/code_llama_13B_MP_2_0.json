This means that if we know that the griffin was in the forest, we can infer that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n* The second premise simply states that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of inference.\n\n* Based on the first premise and the second premise, we can conclude that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. Therefore, we can infer that the unicorn was in the forest based on these premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
