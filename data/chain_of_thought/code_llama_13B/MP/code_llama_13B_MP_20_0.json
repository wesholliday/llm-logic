This means that the relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana is one-to-one.\n\nStep 3: Consider the evidence.\n\n* We are given the fact that \"the apple was red.\" This tells us that the apple is indeed red, but it does not tell us anything about the color of the banana.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the premise and the evidence, we cannot infer that \"the banana was yellow\" because there is no direct connection between the color of the apple and the color of the banana. The relationship between the two fruits is one-to-one, but we do not know whether the banana is yellow or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
