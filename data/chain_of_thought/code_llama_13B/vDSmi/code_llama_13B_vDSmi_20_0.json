Premise 1 states that either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head. This means that if the sunglasses are not in her bag, then they must be perched on her head.\n2. Premise 2 states that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. This means that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n3. From premises 1 and 2, we can conclude that if the sunglasses are not in her bag and they are not perched on her head, then they must be somewhere else. This means that the conclusion is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
