Since we have assumed that the notebook is in the drawer, this means that it cannot be sitting on the nightstand.\nStep 3: From premise 2, we know that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This means that it could be in the drawer or somewhere else. Since we have assumed that the notebook is in the drawer, this means that it must be in the drawer.\nStep 4: Therefore, we can conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
