This is a conditional argument, also known as a syllogism.\n\nStep 2: Determine the conclusion based on the premises. If the first premise is true and the second premise is false, then the conclusion must be true. However, if the first premise is false or the second premise is true, then the conclusion cannot be deduced from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument based on the conclusion. If the conclusion can be deduced from the premises, then the argument is logically valid. Otherwise, it is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
