Since we have assumed that the keys are in the drawer, it follows that they cannot be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, premise 1 is logically valid.\nStep 3: From premise 2, we know that the keys might not be dangling in the cabinet. However, since we have assumed that the keys are in the drawer, it follows that they cannot be dangling in the cabinet. Therefore, premise 2 is logically valid.\nStep 4: From steps 1-3, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
