Modus ponens states that if we have a statement (P \u2192 Q) and another statement (Q), then we can conclude that P is true. In this case, we have:\n\n* If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. (Premise 1)\n* Amy played tennis. (Premise 2)\n\nTherefore, by using modus ponens, we can deduce that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
