Therefore, if Bob chose pasta, it follows that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n\nStep 3: We are also given the second statement, which states that Bob chose pasta.\n\nStep 4: Based on the first and second statements, we can logically deduce that Sue chose pizza. This is because if Bob chose pasta, it follows that Sue must have chosen pizza. Therefore, we can conclude that Sue chose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
