A logical implication is a statement of the form \"if P, then Q,\" where P is the premise and Q is the conclusion. In this case, the premise is \"the alien visited Mars\" and the conclusion is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nStep 3: We can see that the given information implies that the alien visited Mars because the conclusion follows logically from the premise. Therefore, we can deduce that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
