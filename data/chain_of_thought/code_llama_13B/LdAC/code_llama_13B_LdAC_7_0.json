This means that if Chris finished the race, then Alex must have also finished it.\n\nStep 3:\nWe are given the second statement, which states that Chris finished the race. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex must have also finished the race, since we know that if Chris finishes the race, then Alex must also finish it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
