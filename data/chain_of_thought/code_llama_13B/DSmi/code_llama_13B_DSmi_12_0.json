This is because the first statement implies that the jacket is either draped over the chair or hanging in the closet, and the second statement suggests that the jacket might not be hanging in the closet, but it could also be draped over the chair. Therefore, we can conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
