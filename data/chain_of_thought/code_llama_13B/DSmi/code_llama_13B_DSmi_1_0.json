It does not necessarily mean that Fido is inside and must be in the garden at the same time.\n\nStep 3:\nNow let's look at the second statement: \"Fido might not be in the garden.\" This means that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden, but we don't know for sure.\n\nStep 4:\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that Fido is inside. The first statement only tells us that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden, and the second statement only tells us that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden. We don't know for sure whether Fido is inside or not, so we cannot infer that Fido is inside based on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: No",
