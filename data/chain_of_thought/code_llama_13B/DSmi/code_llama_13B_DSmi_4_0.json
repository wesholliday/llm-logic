In this case, the condition is \"the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\" If we assume that the cat is not napping on the couch and is not playing in the bedroom, then the conclusion \"The cat is napping on the couch\" would be false. Therefore, we cannot infer that the cat is napping on the couch from the premises alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
