However, if the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they cannot be in the closet. Therefore, we can infer that the shoes are not in the closet.\n\nStep 2: The second statement is a logical consequence of the first statement. If the shoes are not in the closet, then they must be lined up by the door. This means that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door. Therefore, we can infer that the shoes are lined up by the door.\n\nStep 3: The third statement is a logical contradiction. If the shoes are lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet. However, if the shoes are not in the closet, then they cannot be lined up by the door. Therefore, we can infer that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\nStep 4: The fourth statement is a logical consequence of the third statement. If the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet. This means that the shoes are either in the closet or lined up by the door. Therefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
