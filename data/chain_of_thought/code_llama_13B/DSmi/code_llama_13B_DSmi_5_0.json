This is because if the cookies were not in the jar and must therefore be hidden in the pantry, then they would have to be hidden in the pantry, which contradicts the statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry.\" Therefore, it is not possible for the cookies to be hidden in the pantry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
