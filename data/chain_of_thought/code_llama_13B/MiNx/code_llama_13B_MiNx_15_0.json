However, this does not necessarily mean that the dreb must not have been vroombed.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed\" from the statement \"The dreb might not have been vroombed.\" The statement only implies that it is possible that the dreb was not vroombed, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the dreb actually was vroombed.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed\" from the statement \"The dreb might not have been vroombed.\"",
