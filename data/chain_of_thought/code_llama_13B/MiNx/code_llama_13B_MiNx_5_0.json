However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\" from the statement \"The zinger might not have been fraggled.\" The statement only implies that it is possible that the zinger was not fraggled, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the zinger must have been fraggled.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\" from the statement \"The zinger might not have been fraggled.\"",
