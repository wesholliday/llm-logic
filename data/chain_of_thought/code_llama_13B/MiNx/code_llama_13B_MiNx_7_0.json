This implies that the whiffle must have been shanked, as there is no other possibility. Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" from this statement.\n\nStep 3: Reason and answer.\nBased on our analysis, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked\" from the statement \"The whiffle might not have been shanked.\" Therefore, the answer is no.",
