However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" from the statement \"The fribble might not have been snurgled.\" The statement only implies that it is possible that the fribble was not snurgled, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the fribble must have been snurgled.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" from the statement \"The fribble might not have been snurgled.\"",
