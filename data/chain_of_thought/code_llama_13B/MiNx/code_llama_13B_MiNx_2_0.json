The conclusion suggests that it is not necessarily true that the wug was flooped. These two statements are similar in that they both suggest that there is some uncertainty about whether or not the wug was flooped.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the premise and conclusion, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the wug must have been flooped\" from \"The wug might not have been flooped.\" This means that we can conclude that it is possible, but not certain, that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
