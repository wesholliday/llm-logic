This does not necessarily mean that the clug must have been fleeked, as there are other possibilities such as the clug being fleeked or not being fleeked at all.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nBased on the statement \"The clug might not have been fleeked,\" we cannot infer that it is not the case that the clug must have been fleeked. This is because there are other possibilities such as the clug being fleeked or not being fleeked at all, which means that the statement does not provide enough information to make a conclusion about whether the clug was fleeked or not.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" from the statement \"The clug might not have been fleeked.\" The answer is no.",
