However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" from the statement \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered.\" The statement only implies that it is possible that the fleeg was not bluttered, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the fleeg actually was bluttered.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" from the statement \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered.\"",
