However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" from the statement \"The smonk might not have been vreebled.\" The statement only implies that it is possible that the smonk was not vreebled, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the smonk must have been vreebled.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" from the statement \"The smonk might not have been vreebled.\"",
