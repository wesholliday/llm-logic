Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shipped.\"\n\nStep 3: Reason logically.\nWe can conclude that the statement \"The smip might not have been shipped\" does not imply that the smip must not have been shipped. Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shipped.\"\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No.",
