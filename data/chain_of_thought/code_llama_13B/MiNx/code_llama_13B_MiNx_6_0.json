This implies that the gromment must have been sploffed at some point in the past, but we do not know if it has been sploffed recently or not.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\" from the statement \"The grommet might not have been sploffed.\" This is because the statement does not provide any information about whether the grommet has been sploffed recently or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
