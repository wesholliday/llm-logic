However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\" from the statement \"The flugel might not have been blimmed.\" The statement only implies that it is possible that the flugel was not blimmed, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the flugel must have been blimmed.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed\" from the statement \"The flugel might not have been blimmed.\"",
