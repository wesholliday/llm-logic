However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the flug must have been blummed.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" from the statement \"The flug might not have been blummed.\" The statement only implies that it is possible that the flug was not blummed, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the flug must have been blummed.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" from the statement \"The flug might not have been blummed.\"",
