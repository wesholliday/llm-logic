However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the glip must have been slogged.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" from the statement \"The glip might not have been slogged.\" The statement only implies that it is possible that the glip was not slogged, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the glip must have been slogged.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer \"It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged\" from the statement \"The glip might not have been slogged.\"",
