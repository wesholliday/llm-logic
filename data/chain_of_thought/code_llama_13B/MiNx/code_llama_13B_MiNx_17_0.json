However, this does not necessarily mean that the flob must have been skizzled.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" from the statement \"The flob might not have been skizzled.\" The statement only implies that it is possible that the flob was not skizzled, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the flob was actually skizzled.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer \"It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled\" from the statement \"The flob might not have been skizzled.\"",
