Therefore, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed.\"\n\nStep 3: Reason and answer.\nBased on our analysis, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" from the statement \"The splat might not have been morphed.\" Therefore, the answer is no.",
