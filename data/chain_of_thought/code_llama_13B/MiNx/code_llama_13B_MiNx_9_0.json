However, this does not necessarily mean that it is not the case that the twonk must have been plinked.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference.\nWe cannot infer \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" from the statement \"The twonk might not have been plinked.\" The statement only implies that it is possible that the twonk was not plinked, but it does not provide any information about whether or not the twonk must have been plinked.\n\nStep 4: Provide an answer.\nAnswer: No. We cannot infer \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" from the statement \"The twonk might not have been plinked.\"",
