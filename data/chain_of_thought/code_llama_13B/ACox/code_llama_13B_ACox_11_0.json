However, this statement does not necessarily imply that the flug was blummed.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the information provided to determine whether we can infer \"The flug was blummed.\"\n\n* Based on the information provided, we cannot infer that the flug was blummed from \"The flug was zimmed\" and \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\" The second statement does not necessarily imply that the flug was blummed.\n\nAnswer: No",
