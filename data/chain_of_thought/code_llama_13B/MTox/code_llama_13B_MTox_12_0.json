Modus tollens is a rule that states \"if p implies q and not-q, then not-p.\" In this case, premise 1 (the smip did not lup the zoint) implies premise 2 (if the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint), and the conclusion (the smip was not shripped) follows from these premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
