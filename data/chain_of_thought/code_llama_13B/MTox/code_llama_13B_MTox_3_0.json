The second statement only states a hypothetical scenario where the splat quanks if it is morphed, but it does not provide any evidence to support this claim.\n\nStep 4: Reach a conclusion.\n\n* Based on the analysis of the information provided, we cannot infer that \"the splat was not morphed\" because there is no evidence to support this claim. Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: no.\"",
