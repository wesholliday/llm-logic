This means that if we assume that the book was written by James, we can conclude that it is a mystery novel.\n2. The second premise states that the book was written by James. This means that we have established that the book was indeed written by James.\n3. Based on the first and second premises, we can logically deduce that the conclusion must be true: the book is a mystery novel.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid. Answer: yes",
