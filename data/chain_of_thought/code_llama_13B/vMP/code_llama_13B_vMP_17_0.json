This is an argument from conditional premises (if-then) because it has two premises, one of which is a condition and the other is its consequence.\n\nStep 2: Determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion 'Kate ate salad' does not logically follow from the premise 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad' and the premise 'Ben ate pasta'. The conclusion is not necessarily true if the premise 'Ben ate pasta' is false.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument based on the logical validity of its conclusion. Since the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
