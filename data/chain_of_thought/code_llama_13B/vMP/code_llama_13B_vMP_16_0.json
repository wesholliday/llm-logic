            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the type of argument. This is a conditional argument, as it uses an if-then statement.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the premises are logically valid. The first premise states that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. This is a logical implication, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the 'if') is true, then the consequent (the part after the 'then') must also be true. However, this does not mean that the consequent is necessarily true even if the antecedent is false. Therefore, the first premise is logically valid.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. The second premise states that the shirt was cotton. Since we know that the first premise is logically valid, we can conclude that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim. Therefore, the conclusion 'The pants were denim' follows from the premises.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the argument is logically valid. Since the first and second premises are logically valid, and the conclusion follows from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
