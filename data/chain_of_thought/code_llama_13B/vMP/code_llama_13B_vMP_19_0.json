            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the type of argument. This is a conditional argument, as it uses an if-then statement.\n\nStep 2: Determine whether the premises are logically valid. The first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. This is a logical statement, as it is based on a known fact (Tom watching football) and a conclusion that can be drawn from that fact (Jen watching basketball).\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The second premise states that Tom watched football. This is also a logical statement, as it is based on a known fact (Tom's actions).\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. Since the first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball, and the second premise states that Tom watched football, we can conclude that Jen watched basketball. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
