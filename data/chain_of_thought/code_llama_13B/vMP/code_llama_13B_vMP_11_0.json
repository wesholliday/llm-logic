The first premise states that \"if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This is a logical implication, which means that if the antecedent (the part before the 'then') is true, then the consequent (the part after the 'then') must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The second premise states that \"the cake was chocolate.\" This is a statement of fact, and it does not necessarily imply anything about the muffins. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the muffins were blueberry based solely on this premise.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether the argument is logically valid. Since the conclusion does not follow logically from the premises, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
