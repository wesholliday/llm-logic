The first premise is \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" The second premise is \"The dog was inside.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument based on the given information. The argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premises. The first premise states that if the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside. Since we know that the dog was inside, we can conclude that the cat must be outside. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
