Therefore, Chris finished the race (conclusion)\n\nThis argument is logically valid because it follows the rules of logical reasoning. The first premise states that if something is true, then its conclusion must also be true. In this case, if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have also finished the race. Since we know that Alex did finish the race (premise 2), we can conclude that Chris must have also finished the race (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: yes",
