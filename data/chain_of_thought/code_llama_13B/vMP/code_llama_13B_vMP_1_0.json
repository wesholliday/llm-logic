The first premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was also at the wedding. This means that if we assume that Mary was at the wedding (the second premise), we can conclude that Sue was also at the wedding (the conclusion). Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
