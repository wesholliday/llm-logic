The first premise is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" The second premise is \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument based on the given information. The argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows from the premises. The first premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. Since Lisa bought the red shirt (the second premise), we can conclude that Mark also bought the blue shirt (the conclusion).\n\nAnswer: yes",
