The first premise states that \"if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a logical statement, as it uses a conditional statement to make a claim about the relationship between two objects (the apple and the banana).\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises. The second premise states that \"the apple was red.\" However, this does not necessarily imply that the banana is yellow. In fact, it could be any color. Therefore, the conclusion \"The banana was yellow\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises alone.\n\nStep 4: Conclude whether the argument is logically valid. Since the conclusion cannot be logically deduced from the premises, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
