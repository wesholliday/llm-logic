This means that if the antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must also be true. In this case, the antecedent is \"Ben ate pasta,\" and the consequent is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nStep 3: We are also given that the second statement, \"Kate ate salad,\" is true.\n\nStep 4: Based on the information we have been given, it follows logically that Ben ate pasta. This is because if Kate ate salad and the implication \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is true, then it must be the case that Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
