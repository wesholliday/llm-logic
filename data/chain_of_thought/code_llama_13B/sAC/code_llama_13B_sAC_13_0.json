            "content": "\nStep 1: The premises are \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nStep 2: We need to determine if the conclusion \"The car was red\" follows from these premises.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we can use a logical deduction method called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (i.e., an \"if-then\" statement) and its antecedent is true, then we can conclude that the consequent is also true.\n\nStep 4: In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" The antecedent (i.e., the \"if\" part) is \"The car was red,\" which is true based on our premise. Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent (i.e., the \"then\" part) is also true: \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nStep 5: Since the conclusion follows from the premises using modus ponens, we can say that \"The car was red\" is a logical consequence of the premises. Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: yes.\"",
