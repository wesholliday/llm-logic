In this case, we can use a syllogism with three premises and one conclusion. The first premise is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" The second premise is \"The robot visited Jupiter.\" And the third premise is \"The alien visited Mars.\"\n\nStep 4: We can now use a syllogism to determine if the conclusion follows from the premises. In this case, we have a valid syllogism, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The alien visited Mars\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
