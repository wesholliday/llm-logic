Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement (i.e., an \"if-then\" statement) is true and its antecedent (the part before the \"then\") is also true, then the consequent (the part after the \"then\") must be true as well.\n\nStep 4: In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" The antecedent of this statement is \"The griffin was in the forest,\" and the consequent is \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nStep 5: Since we know that \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is true, and since \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" is a conditional statement with an antecedent that is true, it follows by modus ponens that the consequent of this statement must also be true.\n\nStep 6: Therefore, we can conclude that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
