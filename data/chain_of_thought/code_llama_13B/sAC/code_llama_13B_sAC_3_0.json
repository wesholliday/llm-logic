Modus ponens states that if a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is true and its antecedent (P) is also true, then the consequent (Q) must be true as well.\n\nStep 4: In this case, we can apply modus ponens to the premises as follows:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (Premise 1)\n2. The book is a mystery novel. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the book was written by James. (Modus ponens)\n\nStep 5: Since we have applied modus ponens correctly and our conclusion logically follows from our premises, we can conclude that \"The book was written by James\" is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
