Therefore, if the fleeg is bluttered, we can infer that it must be surned.\n* If the fleeg might not be surned, then it is possible that it is bluttered. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is bluttered.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the reasoning provided.\n\n* Based on the information given and the logical reasoning applied, we cannot infer that the fleeg is bluttered. Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: no\".",
