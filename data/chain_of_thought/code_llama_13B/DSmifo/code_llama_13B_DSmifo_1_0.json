This means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside. This means that if Fido is not in the garden, then he must be inside.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions.\n\nBased on the information provided, it can be inferred that Fido is inside. This conclusion is drawn because if Fido were not in the garden, then he would have to be inside by the second statement. Therefore, we can conclude that Fido is indeed inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
