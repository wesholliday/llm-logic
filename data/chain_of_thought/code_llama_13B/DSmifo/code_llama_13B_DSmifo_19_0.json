This means that there is a possibility that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser. This means that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser. This is because the second statement implies that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser. Since we know that the watch might not be on his wrist, this means that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
