The first premise states that the cat might not be playing in the bedroom, which means it could be doing something else. The second premise provides two possibilities for what the cat could be doing: either it's playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch. Since we know that the cat is not playing in the bedroom (per the first premise), the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
