Therefore, the second statement can be rewritten as follows:\n\n* The watch must not be on his wrist.\n* Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is not charging on the dresser.\n\nStep 3:\nFrom the second statement, we know that either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is not charging on the dresser. Since we have already established that the watch cannot be on his wrist, we can conclude that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, from 'It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist' together with 'Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser', we can infer that 'The watch is charging on the dresser'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
