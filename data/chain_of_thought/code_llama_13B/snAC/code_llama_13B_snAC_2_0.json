            "content": "\nStep 1: The premises are \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" and \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nStep 2: We need to determine whether the conclusion \"The griffin was in the forest\" follows logically from these premises.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we can use a logical deduction technique called modus ponens. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (i.e., an \"if-then\" statement) and its antecedent is true, then we can conclude that the consequent must also be true.\n\nStep 4: In this case, the conditional statement is \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" The antecedent (i.e., the \"if\" part) is \"The griffin was in the forest,\" which we know to be true based on our premises.\n\nStep 5: Therefore, by modus ponens, we can conclude that \"The unicorn was in the forest\" must also be true.\n\nStep 6: Since we have established that \"The unicorn was in the forest\" is true, and since this statement implies that \"The griffin was in the forest,\" we can conclude that \"The griffin was in the forest\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
