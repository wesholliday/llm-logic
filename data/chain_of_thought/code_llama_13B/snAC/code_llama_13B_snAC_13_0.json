            "content": "\nStep 1: The premises are \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" and \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nStep 2: We need to determine whether the conclusion \"The car was red\" follows from these premises.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we can use a logical argument form called a syllogism. A syllogism consists of three parts: a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. In this case, the major premise is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" which is the first premise. The minor premise is \"The truck was blue,\" which is the second premise.\n\nStep 4: To determine whether the conclusion \"The car was red\" follows from these premises, we need to see if it is logically possible for the conclusion to be true while the premises are false. In other words, we need to check for a logical contradiction between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nStep 5: To do this, we can use a tool called a truth table. A truth table shows all possible combinations of the premises and the conclusion, and it helps us determine whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nStep 6: Using a truth table, we can see that if \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true and \"The truck was blue\" is true, then \"The car was red\" is also true. Therefore, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
