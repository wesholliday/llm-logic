To do this, we can use a logical argument form, such as a syllogism or a deductive argument.\n\nSyllogism:\n\n1. All A are B. (Premise 1)\n2. The book is an A. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the book is a mystery novel. (Conclusion)\n\nDeductive Argument:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (Premise 1)\n2. The book is a mystery novel. (Premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the book was written by James. (Conclusion)\n\nStep 3: We can see that both the syllogism and deductive argument are valid, which means that the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Therefore, we can conclude that 'The book was written by James' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
