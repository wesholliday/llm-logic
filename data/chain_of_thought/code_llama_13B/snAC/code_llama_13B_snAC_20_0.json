            "content": "\nStep 1: The premises are \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nStep 2: We need to determine whether the conclusion \"The apple was red\" follows from these premises.\n\nStep 3: To do this, we can use a logical argument form called a syllogism. A syllogism consists of three parts: a major premise, a minor premise, and a conclusion. In this case, the major premise is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow,\" which is the first premise. The minor premise is \"The banana was yellow,\" which is the second premise.\n\nStep 4: To determine whether the conclusion \"The apple was red\" follows from these premises, we need to see if it is logically possible for the conclusion to be true while the premises are false. In other words, we need to check for a logical contradiction between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nStep 5: To do this, we can use a tool called a truth table. A truth table shows all possible combinations of the premises and the conclusion, and allows us to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. In this case, the truth table would look like this:\n\n| Premise 1 | Premise 2 | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| True | True | True |\n| False | True | False |\n| True | False | False |\n| False | False | False |\n\nStep 6: From the truth table, we can see that the conclusion \"The apple was red\" follows from the premises \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow.\" Therefore, the answer is \"Answer: yes.\"",
