Therefore, we know that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n\nStep 3: Since the first statement implies that either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen, and we have already established that the phone is not ringing in the kitchen, we can conclude that the phone must be in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
