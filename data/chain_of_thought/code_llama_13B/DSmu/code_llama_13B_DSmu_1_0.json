Let's call this statement A.\n\nStep 3:\nFrom the second statement, we know that it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. Let's call this statement B.\n\nStep 4:\nWe are asked to infer whether Fido is inside or not. To do this, we need to consider the relationship between statements A and B.\n\nStep 5:\nIf statement A is true, then either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. If statement B is true, then it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that if statement A is true and statement B is true, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nStep 6:\nHowever, if statement A is false, then either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden cannot be true. If statement B is true, then it's not the case that Fido must be in the garden. This means that if statement A is false and statement B is true, we cannot infer anything about whether Fido is inside or not.\n\nStep 7:\nTherefore, to determine whether we can infer that Fido is inside from statements A and B, we need to consider the relationship between these two statements. If statement A is true and statement B is true, then we can infer that Fido is inside. However, if statement A is false or statement B is false, then we cannot infer anything about whether Fido is inside or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
