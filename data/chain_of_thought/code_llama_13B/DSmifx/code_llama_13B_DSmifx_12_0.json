This means that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n* The second statement suggests that the smip might not be lupped. This means that there is a possibility that the smip is not lupped.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the analysis.\n\n* Based on the analysis, we can conclude that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped. Therefore, we cannot infer that the smip is shripped from the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: No",
