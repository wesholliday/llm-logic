If the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n* However, the second statement tells us that the splat might not be quanked. This means that there is a possibility that the splat is not morphed either.\n* Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The splat is morphed\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
