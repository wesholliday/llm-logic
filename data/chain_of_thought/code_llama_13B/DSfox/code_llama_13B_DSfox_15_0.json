The dreb is not spened.\n2. Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed.\n\nFrom these statements, we can conclude that the dreb is either spened or vroombed. However, we are also told that the dreb is not spened. Therefore, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
