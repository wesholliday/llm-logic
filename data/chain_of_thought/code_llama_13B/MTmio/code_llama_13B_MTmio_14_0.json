In this case, the first statement (Premise 1) is the antecedent of the second statement (Premise 2), and the conclusion is the opposite of the antecedent.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the argument is valid or invalid.\n\nThe argument is invalid because it is based on a false premise. The first premise states that the wolf might not have been in the den, which means that there is no guarantee that the wolf was not in the den. However, the second premise assumes that the wolf was in the den, which is a conclusion that cannot be drawn from the given information. Therefore, the argument is invalid and we cannot infer that the bear was not in the cave based on the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
