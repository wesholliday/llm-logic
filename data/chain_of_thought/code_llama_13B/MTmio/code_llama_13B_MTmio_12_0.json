In this case, the conditional statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo,\" which is true because we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo. The negation of this statement is \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo,\" which is also true because we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo. Therefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
