If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the argument.\nThe argument is based on a logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. This occurs when we assume that the conclusion of a conditional statement is true, without providing any evidence to support this assumption. In this case, we are assuming that Mark must have bought the blue shirt, without any evidence to support this claim.\n\nStep 3: Draw the conclusion.\nBased on the premises and the fallacy identified in step 2, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. The argument is invalid, and we cannot draw a conclusion based on it.\n\nAnswer: No",
