This means that there is at least one possibility that Kate did not eat salad.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the second premise.\nThe second premise states that if Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad. This means that if Ben ate pasta, it is certain that Kate also ate salad.\n\nStep 4: Draw conclusions from the premises.\nFrom the first and second premises, we can conclude that if Ben did not eat pasta, then it is possible that Kate did not eat salad. However, if Ben did eat pasta, then it is certain that Kate also ate salad. Therefore, we cannot infer that Ben did not eat pasta from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
