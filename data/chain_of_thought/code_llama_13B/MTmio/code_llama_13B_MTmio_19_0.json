This means that there is a possibility that she did not watch basketball, but it does not necessarily mean that she did not watch basketball.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the second premise.\nThe second premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This means that if Tom watched football, then there is a possibility that Jen watched basketball. However, it does not necessarily mean that Jen did watch basketball.\n\nStep 4: Draw conclusions.\nBased on the given premises, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football. The first premise only states that Jen might not have watched basketball, and the second premise only states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. There is no information provided about whether or not Tom watched football.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Answer: No.",
