In this case, the conclusion \"Sue did not choose pizza\" logically follows from the premise \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta,\" which is true because it is a conditional statement that is based on the assumption that Bob might not have chosen pasta. Therefore, the argument is valid and we can infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
