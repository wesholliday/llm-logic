This means that if the cake was chocolate, then it follows that the muffins were also blueberry.\n\nStep 2: We are given the information that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This contradicts the conditional statement we were given earlier, as if the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake must not have been chocolate.\n\nStep 3: Therefore, we can infer that the cake was not chocolate. The contradiction between the two statements means that the first statement is false, and therefore the second statement must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
