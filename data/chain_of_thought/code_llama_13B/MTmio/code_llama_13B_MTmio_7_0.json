This is because if Alex finished the race and Chris did not finish the race, then we would have a contradiction since we are assuming that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nStep 4: Therefore, from 'If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race', we can conclude that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris might not have finished the race either.\n\nAnswer: No",
