The first premise is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The apple was not red.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion \\( \\neg A \\) logically follows from the premises \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and we know that \\( \\neg B \\) is true, we can conclude \\( \\neg A \\). \n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n- Premise 1: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg B \\)\n- By modus tollens, from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg A \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
