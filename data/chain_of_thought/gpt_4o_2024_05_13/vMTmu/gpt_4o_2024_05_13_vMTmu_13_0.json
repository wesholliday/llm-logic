            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( R \\rightarrow B \\)\n     where \\( R \\) represents \"the car was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the truck must have been blue.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The car was not red.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg R \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n- From the first premise \\( R \\rightarrow B \\), we know that if \\( R \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg B \\) tells us that \\( B \\) is false.\n- Given \\( R \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can use the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive of \\( R \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg R \\).\n- Since \\( \\neg B \\) is true (from the second premise), and \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg R \\) is logically equivalent to the first premise, we can conclude \\( \\neg R \\).\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg R \\) logically follows from the premises \\( R \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
