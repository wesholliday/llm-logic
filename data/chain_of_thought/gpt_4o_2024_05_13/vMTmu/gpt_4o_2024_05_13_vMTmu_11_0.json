            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg M \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nThis argument follows the form of Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus Tollens states that if \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\) are true, then \\( \\neg C \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
