            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logical terms, we have:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n2. \\( \\neg Q \\)\n3. Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis is a classic example of Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus Tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
