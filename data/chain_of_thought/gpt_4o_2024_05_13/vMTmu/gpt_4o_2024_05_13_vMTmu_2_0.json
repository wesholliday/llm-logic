The first premise is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n     where \\( G \\) represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg U \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg G \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( \\neg G \\) logically follows from \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\).\n\nTo do this, we can use the rules of logical inference. Specifically, we can use Modus Tollens, which states that if \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\) are true, then \\( \\neg G \\) must be true.\n\n- Modus Tollens: If \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\), then \\( \\neg G \\).\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n2. \\( \\neg U \\)\n\nBy Modus Tollens:\n- From \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg G \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg G \\) logically follows from the premises \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
