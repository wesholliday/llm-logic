            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n     where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n- From the first premise \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), we know that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg S \\) tells us that \\( S \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\), we can use the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\). This means that if \\( S \\) is false, then \\( M \\) must also be false.\n\nSince the second premise \\( \\neg S \\) tells us that \\( S \\) is indeed false, we can apply the contrapositive to conclude that \\( \\neg M \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg M \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
