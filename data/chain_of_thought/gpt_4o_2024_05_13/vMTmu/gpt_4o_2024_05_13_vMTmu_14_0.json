The first premise is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n     where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg W \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nNow, let's put the premises and conclusion together:\n- Premise 1: \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg W \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nTo check if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion \\( \\neg B \\) logically follows from the premises \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) and \\( \\neg W \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically Modus Tollens, which states that if \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) and \\( \\neg W \\) are true, then \\( \\neg B \\) must also be true, we can see that:\n\n- From \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) and \\( \\neg W \\), we can infer \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg B \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
