            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin must have taken a train.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically Modus Tollens, we know that:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If P then Q)\n- And \\( \\neg Q \\) (Not Q)\n- Then \\( \\neg P \\) (Not P)\n\nThis is because if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would have to be true (according to the first premise). Since \\( Q \\) is not true (according to the second premise), \\( P \\) cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
