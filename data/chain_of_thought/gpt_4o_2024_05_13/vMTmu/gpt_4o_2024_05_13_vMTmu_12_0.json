The first premise is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know that \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis is a valid form of argument known as modus tollens. Therefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
