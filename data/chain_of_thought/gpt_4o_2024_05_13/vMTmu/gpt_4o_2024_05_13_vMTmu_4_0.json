The first premise is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow R \\)\n     where \\( A \\) represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( R \\) represents \"the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg R \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n- From the first premise \\( A \\rightarrow R \\), we know that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( R \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg R \\) tells us that \\( R \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and \\( \\neg R \\), we can use the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) is \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). \n\nSince we have \\( \\neg R \\) from the second premise, we can apply the contrapositive to conclude \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg A \\) logically follows from the premises \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and \\( \\neg R \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
