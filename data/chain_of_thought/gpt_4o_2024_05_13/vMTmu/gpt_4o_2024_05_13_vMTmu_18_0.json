            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck must have been metal.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, let's put the premises and conclusion together:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus Tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
