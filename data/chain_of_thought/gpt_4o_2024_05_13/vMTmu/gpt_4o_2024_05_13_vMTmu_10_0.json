First premise: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n     where \\( D \\) represents \"the dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the cat must have been outside.\"\n\n2. Second premise: \"It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The dog was not inside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg D \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- We have \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) (If \\( D \\), then \\( C \\))\n- We also have \\( \\neg C \\) (Not \\( C \\))\n\nFrom the premises, we need to determine if \\( \\neg D \\) (Not \\( D \\)) logically follows.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, we know that:\n- If \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\), then \\( \\neg D \\).\n\nThis is because modus tollens states that if \\( D \\) implies \\( C \\), and \\( C \\) is false, then \\( D \\) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg D \\) logically follows from the premises \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
