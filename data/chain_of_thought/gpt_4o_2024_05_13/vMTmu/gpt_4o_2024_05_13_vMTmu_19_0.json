            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n     where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg J \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg T \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n- From the first premise \\( T \\rightarrow J \\), we know that if \\( T \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must also be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg J \\) tells us that \\( J \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg J \\) (Jen did not watch basketball), we need to determine if \\( \\neg T \\) (Tom did not watch football) logically follows.\n\n- If \\( J \\) is false, then for the implication \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) to hold true, \\( T \\) must also be false. This is because an implication \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is true when:\n  - Both \\( T \\) and \\( J \\) are true.\n  - \\( T \\) is false (regardless of \\( J \\)).\n  - \\( J \\) is true (regardless of \\( T \\)).\n\nSince \\( J \\) is false (\\( \\neg J \\)), the only way for \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) to be true is if \\( T \\) is also false (\\( \\neg T \\)).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg T \\) logically follows from the premises \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
