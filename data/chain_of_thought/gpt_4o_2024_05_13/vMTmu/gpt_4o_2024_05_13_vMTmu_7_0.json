            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n     where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris must have finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n- From the first premise \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), we know that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg C \\) tells us that \\( C \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg C \\) (Chris did not finish the race), we need to determine if \\( \\neg A \\) (Alex did not finish the race) logically follows.\n\n- If \\( A \\) were true (Alex finished the race), then \\( C \\) would have to be true (Chris must have finished the race) because of the first premise \\( A \\rightarrow C \\).\n- However, we know from the second premise that \\( C \\) is false (\\( \\neg C \\)).\n\nSince \\( C \\) is false, \\( A \\) cannot be true. If \\( A \\) were true, it would contradict the second premise. Therefore, \\( A \\) must be false.\n\nThus, \\( \\neg A \\) (Alex did not finish the race) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
