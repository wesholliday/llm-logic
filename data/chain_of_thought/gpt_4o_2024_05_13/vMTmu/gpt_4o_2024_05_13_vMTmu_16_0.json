            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow P \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( P \\) represents \"the pants must have been denim.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n- From the first premise \\( S \\rightarrow P \\), we know that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg P \\) tells us that \\( P \\) is false.\n- Given \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n- Since \\( \\neg P \\) is true (from the second premise), and \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is logically equivalent to \\( S \\rightarrow P \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg S \\) logically follows from the premises \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
