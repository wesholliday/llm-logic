The first premise is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens:\n- If we have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If P then Q)\n- And we have \\( \\neg Q \\) (Not Q)\n- Then we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\) (Not P)\n\nThis is because if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would have to be true (according to the first premise). Since \\( Q \\) is not true (according to the second premise), \\( P \\) cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
