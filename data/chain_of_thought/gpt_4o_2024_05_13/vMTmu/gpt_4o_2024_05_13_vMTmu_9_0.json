            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n   - Symbolically: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n2. Premise 2: It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg M \\)\n3. Conclusion: Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg L \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we can use the rules of logical inference. Specifically, we can use Modus Tollens, which states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nApplying Modus Tollens to our premises:\n\n- From Premise 1: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n- From Premise 2: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nAccording to Modus Tollens, if \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\) are true, then \\( \\neg L \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg L \\) (Lisa did not buy the red shirt) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
