            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n     where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy must have played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg J \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n- From the first premise \\( J \\rightarrow A \\), we know that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg A \\) tells us that \\( A \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), we can use the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\). This means that if \\( A \\) is false, then \\( J \\) must also be false.\n\nSince the second premise \\( \\neg A \\) tells us that \\( A \\) is false, we can apply the contrapositive to conclude that \\( J \\) must be false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg J \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
