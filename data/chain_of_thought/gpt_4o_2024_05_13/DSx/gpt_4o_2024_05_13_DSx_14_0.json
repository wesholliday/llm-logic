The first statement is: \"Either the clug is fleeked or it is snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( F \\lor S \\)\n     where \\( F \\) represents \"The clug is fleeked\" and \\( S \\) represents \"The clug is snugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The clug is not snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n     where \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"The clug is not snugged.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( F \\) (The clug is fleeked) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement, \\( F \\lor S \\), at least one of \\( F \\) or \\( S \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement, \\( \\neg S \\), \\( S \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( S \\) is false, then the only way for \\( F \\lor S \\) to be true is if \\( F \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( S \\) is false and \\( F \\lor S \\) must be true, \\( F \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
