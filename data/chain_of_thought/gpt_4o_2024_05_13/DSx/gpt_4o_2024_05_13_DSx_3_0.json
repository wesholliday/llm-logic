The first statement is: \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( M \\lor Q \\)\n   - Where \\( M \\) represents \"The splat is morphed\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"The splat is quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The splat is not quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( M \\) (The splat is morphed) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement, \\( M \\lor Q \\), at least one of \\( M \\) or \\( Q \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement, \\( \\neg Q \\), \\( Q \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( Q \\) is false, then the only way for \\( M \\lor Q \\) to be true is if \\( M \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( Q \\) is false and \\( M \\lor Q \\) must be true, \\( M \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
