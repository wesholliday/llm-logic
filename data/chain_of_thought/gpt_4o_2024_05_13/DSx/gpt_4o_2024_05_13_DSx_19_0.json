The first statement is: \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it is plagged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( V \\lor P \\)\n     - Where \\( V \\) represents \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n     - And \\( P \\) represents \"The smonk is plagged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The smonk is not plagged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"The smonk is not plagged.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( V \\) (The smonk is vreebled) from \\( V \\lor P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( V \\lor P \\) (either \\( V \\) or \\( P \\)) and \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)), we can conclude \\( V \\) (the other part of the disjunction must be true).\n\nTherefore, from \\( V \\lor P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we can indeed infer \\( V \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
