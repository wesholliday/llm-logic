The first statement is: \"Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( S \\lor T \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"The glip is slogged.\"\n     - And \\( T \\) represents \"The glip is tragged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The glip is not tragged.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg T \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg T \\) means \"not T\" or \"The glip is not tragged.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The glip is slogged) from these two statements.\n\n3. We have:\n   - \\( S \\lor T \\) (Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged)\n   - \\( \\neg T \\) (The glip is not tragged)\n\n4. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( S \\lor T \\) and \\( \\neg T \\), we can use the process of elimination to infer \\( S \\). This is because if \\( T \\) is false, the only way for \\( S \\lor T \\) to be true is if \\( S \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the glip is slogged or it is tragged\" and \"The glip is not tragged,\" we can indeed infer \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
