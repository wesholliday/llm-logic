The first statement is: \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( B \\lor S \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"The fleeg is bluttered\" and \\( S \\) represents \"The fleeg is surned.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fleeg is not surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (The fleeg is bluttered) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement, \\( B \\lor S \\), at least one of \\( B \\) or \\( S \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement, \\( \\neg S \\), \\( S \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( S \\) is false, then the only way for \\( B \\lor S \\) to be true is if \\( B \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( S \\) is false and \\( B \\lor S \\) must be true, we can conclude that \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
