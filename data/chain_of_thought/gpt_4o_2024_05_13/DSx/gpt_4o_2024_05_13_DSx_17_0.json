The first statement is: \"Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( S \\lor M \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n     - And \\( M \\) represents \"The flob is movated.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flob is not movated.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"The flob is not movated.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The flob is skizzled) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement \\( S \\lor M \\), at least one of \\( S \\) or \\( M \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement \\( \\neg M \\), \\( M \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( M \\) is false, then the only way for \\( S \\lor M \\) to be true is if \\( S \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, given \\( S \\lor M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can logically infer that \\( S \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
