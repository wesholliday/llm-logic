The first statement is: \"Either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( F \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( F \\) represents \"The wug is flooped\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The wug is bimmed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug is not bimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( F \\) (The wug is flooped) from \\( F \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction (\\( F \\lor B \\)) and we know that one of the components of the disjunction is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), then the other component must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\n4. Since \\( \\neg B \\) is true, \\( B \\) is false. Therefore, for the disjunction \\( F \\lor B \\) to hold true, \\( F \\) must be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The wug is flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
