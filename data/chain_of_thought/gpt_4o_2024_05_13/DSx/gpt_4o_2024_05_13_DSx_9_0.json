The first statement is: \"Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor V \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) stands for \"The twonk is plinked.\"\n     - And \\( V \\) stands for \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The twonk is not plinked.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) stands for \"The twonk is not plinked.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( V \\) (The twonk is varnished) from \\( P \\lor V \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( P \\lor V \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( V \\)) and we know that \\( P \\) is false (\\( \\neg P \\)), then the only way for the disjunction to be true is if \\( V \\) is true.\n\n4. Therefore, from \\( P \\lor V \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we can infer \\( V \\).\n\nSo, based on the logical analysis, we can indeed infer that \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
