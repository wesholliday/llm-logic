The first statement is: \"Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( S \\lor L \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents \"The smip is shripped\" and \\( L \\) represents \"The smip is lupped.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The smip is not lupped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg L \\)\n     where \\( \\neg L \\) represents \"The smip is not lupped.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The smip is shripped) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement, \\( S \\lor L \\), at least one of \\( S \\) or \\( L \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement, \\( \\neg L \\), \\( L \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( L \\) is false, then the only way for \\( S \\lor L \\) to be true is if \\( S \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, given \\( S \\lor L \\) and \\( \\neg L \\), we can logically infer that \\( S \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
