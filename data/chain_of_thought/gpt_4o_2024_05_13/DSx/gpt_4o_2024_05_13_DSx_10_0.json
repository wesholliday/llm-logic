The first statement is: \"Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( S \\lor G \\)\n     where \\( S \\) stands for \"The wug is sproinged\" and \\( G \\) stands for \"The wug is garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug is not garpled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg G \\)\n     where \\( \\neg G \\) means \"The wug is not garpled.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The wug is sproinged) from \\( S \\lor G \\) and \\( \\neg G \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( S \\lor G \\) (either \\( S \\) or \\( G \\)) and \\( \\neg G \\) (not \\( G \\)), we can conclude \\( S \\) (the other disjunct must be true).\n\nTherefore, given the statements:\n- \\( S \\lor G \\) (Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled)\n- \\( \\neg G \\) (The wug is not garpled)\n\nWe can logically infer:\n- \\( S \\) (The wug is sproinged)\n\nAnswer: yes",
