The first statement is: \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( S \\lor C \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents \"The fribble is snurgled\" and \\( C \\) represents \"The fribble is crinked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fribble is not crinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The fribble is snurgled) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement, \\( S \\lor C \\), at least one of \\( S \\) or \\( C \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement, \\( \\neg C \\), \\( C \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( C \\) is false, then the only way for \\( S \\lor C \\) to be true is if \\( S \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( C \\) is false and \\( S \\lor C \\) must be true, we can conclude that \\( S \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
