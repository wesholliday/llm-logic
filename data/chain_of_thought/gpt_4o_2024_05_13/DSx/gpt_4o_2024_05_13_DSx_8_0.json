The first statement is: \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( C \\lor D \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents \"The sprocket is cranked\" and \\( D \\) represents \"The sprocket is daggled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The sprocket is not daggled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg D \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( C \\) (The sprocket is cranked) from \\( C \\lor D \\) and \\( \\neg D \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( C \\lor D \\) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\\( \\neg D \\)), then the other disjunct must be true. This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\n4. Applying the disjunctive syllogism:\n   - From \\( C \\lor D \\) and \\( \\neg D \\), we can infer \\( C \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
