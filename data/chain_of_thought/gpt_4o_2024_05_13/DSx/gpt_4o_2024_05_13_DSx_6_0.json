The first statement is: \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( S \\lor P \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents \"The grommet is sploffed\" and \\( P \\) represents \"The grommet is plopped.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The grommet is not plopped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"The grommet is not plopped.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The grommet is sploffed) from \\( S \\lor P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logical inference, if we have \\( S \\lor P \\) (either \\( S \\) or \\( P \\) is true) and \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)), then \\( S \\) must be true. This is because if \\( P \\) is false, the only way for \\( S \\lor P \\) to be true is if \\( S \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\" and \"The grommet is not plopped,\" we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
