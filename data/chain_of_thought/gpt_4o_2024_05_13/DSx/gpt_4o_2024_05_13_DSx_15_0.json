The first statement is: \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( A \\vee B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"The dreb is vroombed\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The dreb is spened.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The dreb is not spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (The dreb is vroombed) from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( A \\vee B \\) and we know that \\( B \\) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), then \\( A \\) must be true in order for the disjunction to hold true.\n\nTherefore, from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can infer \\( A \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
