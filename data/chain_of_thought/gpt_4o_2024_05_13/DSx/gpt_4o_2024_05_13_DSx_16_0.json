The first statement is: \"Either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( C \\lor S \\)\n     - Where \\( C \\) represents \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n     - And \\( S \\) represents \"The sneg is sproted.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The sneg is not sproted.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"The sneg is not sproted.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( C \\) (The sneg is crampled) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement, \\( C \\lor S \\), at least one of \\( C \\) or \\( S \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement, \\( \\neg S \\), \\( S \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( S \\) is false, then the only way for \\( C \\lor S \\) to be true is if \\( C \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( S \\) is false and \\( C \\lor S \\) must be true, we can infer that \\( C \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
