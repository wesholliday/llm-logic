The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mary was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (Sue was at the wedding) from these two statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and we know that \\( M \\) is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens to infer that \\( S \\) must also be true.\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n2. \\( M \\)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can conclude:\n\\( S \\)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
