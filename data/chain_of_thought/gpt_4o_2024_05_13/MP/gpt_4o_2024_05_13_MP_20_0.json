The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"The apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The apple was red.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( B \\) (\"The banana was yellow\") can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( A \\).\n\nIn propositional logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and we know that \\( A \\) is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens to infer that \\( B \\) is true.\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n2. \\( A \\)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can conclude:\n\\( B \\)\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The apple was red,\" we can infer \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
