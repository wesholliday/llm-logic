The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Alex finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( C \\) (Chris finished the race) from the given statements \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( A \\).\n\nIn propositional logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and we know that \\( A \\) is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens to infer \\( C \\). Modus ponens states that if \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is true and \\( A \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must also be true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) (If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race)\n- \\( A \\) (Alex finished the race)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can infer:\n- \\( C \\) (Chris finished the race)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical reasoning, we can infer that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
