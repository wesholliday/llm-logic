            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Jen watched basketball' from the given statements, let's break down the logical structure step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Tom watched football.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( T \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( J \\) (Jen watched basketball) from these two statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and we know that \\( T \\) is true, then we can conclude that \\( J \\) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens, a valid form of argument.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball)\n- \\( T \\) (Tom watched football)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can infer:\n- \\( J \\) (Jen watched basketball)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical reasoning, we can conclude that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
