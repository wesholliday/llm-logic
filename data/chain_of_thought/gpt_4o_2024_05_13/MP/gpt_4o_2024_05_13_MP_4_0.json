The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"The alien visited Mars\" and \\( B \\) is \"The robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The alien visited Mars.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( B \\) (The robot visited Jupiter) can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( A \\).\n\nIn propositional logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and we know that \\( A \\) is true, then we can conclude that \\( B \\) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n- \\( A \\)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can conclude:\n- \\( B \\)\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
