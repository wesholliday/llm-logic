The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( L \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( M \\) (Mark bought the blue shirt) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and we know that \\( L \\) is true, then we can conclude that \\( M \\) must also be true. This is known as Modus Ponens, a valid form of argument.\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n2. \\( L \\)\n\nBy Modus Ponens, we can conclude:\n\\( M \\)\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \"Lisa bought the red shirt,\" we can infer that \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
