The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n     where \\( D \\) represents \"The dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"The cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The dog was inside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \"The cat was outside\" (i.e., \\( C \\)) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) and we know that \\( D \\) is true, we can use modus ponens to infer that \\( C \\) must also be true.\n\n- Given \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\n- And given \\( D \\) (The dog was inside)\n- By modus ponens, we can conclude \\( C \\) (The cat was outside)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the rules of inference, we can indeed infer that \"The cat was outside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
