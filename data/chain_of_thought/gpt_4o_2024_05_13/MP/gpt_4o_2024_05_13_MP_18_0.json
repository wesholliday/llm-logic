            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"The truck was metal\" from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck was metal\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The doll was plastic.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - P (the doll was plastic).\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer Q (the truck was metal) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can infer that Q must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nGiven:\n- If P, then Q (If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal).\n- P (The doll was plastic).\n\nBy modus ponens, we can infer:\n- Q (The truck was metal).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical reasoning, we can infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes",
