The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow B \\)\n     - Where \\( C \\) represents \"The cake was chocolate.\"\n     - And \\( B \\) represents \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cake was chocolate.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( B \\) (The muffins were blueberry) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow B \\) and we know that \\( C \\) is true, then we can conclude that \\( B \\) must also be true. This is known as Modus Ponens.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C \\rightarrow B \\) (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry)\n- \\( C \\) (The cake was chocolate)\n\nBy Modus Ponens, we can infer:\n- \\( B \\) (The muffins were blueberry)\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
