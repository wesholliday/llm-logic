The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as:\n   - If P, then Q\n   - Where P: The book was written by James\n   - And Q: The book is a mystery novel\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book was written by James.\" This can be represented as:\n   - P\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer Q (The book is a mystery novel) from these statements.\n\n- According to the rules of logical inference, specifically modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nGiven:\n- If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n- P (The book was written by James)\n\nWe can infer:\n- Q (The book is a mystery novel)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the rules of inference, we can conclude that the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes",
