            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"The truck was blue\" from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\text{Car was red} \\rightarrow \\text{Truck was blue} \\).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The car was red.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\text{Car was red} \\).\n\nIn logical terms, we have:\n- \\( \\text{Car was red} \\rightarrow \\text{Truck was blue} \\)\n- \\( \\text{Car was red} \\)\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) and we know that \\( p \\) is true, we can infer that \\( q \\) is true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nHere:\n- \\( p \\) is \"The car was red.\"\n- \\( q \\) is \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nSince both \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) and \\( p \\) are true, we can infer \\( q \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
