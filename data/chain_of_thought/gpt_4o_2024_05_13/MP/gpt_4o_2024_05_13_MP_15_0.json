The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sam took a plane.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( Q \\) (Erin took a train) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nIn propositional logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know that \\( P \\) is true, then we can conclude that \\( Q \\) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train)\n- \\( P \\) (Sam took a plane)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can infer:\n- \\( Q \\) (Erin took a train)\n\nAnswer: yes",
