            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"Amy played tennis\" from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a simple assertion: \"Jeff played basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( J \\)\n\n3. To infer whether \"Amy played tennis\" follows from these statements, we need to apply the rules of logical implication. According to the rules of modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know \\( P \\) is true, then we can conclude \\( Q \\) is true.\n\n4. Applying modus ponens to our statements:\n   - We have \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis).\n   - We also have \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball).\n\n5. By modus ponens, from \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( J \\), we can conclude \\( A \\) (Amy played tennis).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
