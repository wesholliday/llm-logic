            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   - Where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg L \\) represents \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" and \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) can be inferred from \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), we need to understand the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\).\n   - The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) are always true together.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( L \\rightarrow M \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement.\n   - The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) from \\( L \\rightarrow M \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
