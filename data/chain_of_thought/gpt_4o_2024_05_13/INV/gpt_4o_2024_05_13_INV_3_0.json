The original statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the book was not written by James\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\n3. The logical relationship between \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is known as the inverse. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the inverse is not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel' from 'If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.'\n\nAnswer: no",
