            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo' from 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The statement we are trying to infer is: \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"Joe did not go to the park\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (the inverse) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (the original statement).\n\nAnswer: no",
