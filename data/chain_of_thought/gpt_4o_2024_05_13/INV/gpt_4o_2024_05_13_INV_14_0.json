            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den' from 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the bear was not in the cave\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the wolf was not in the den.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between these statements. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
