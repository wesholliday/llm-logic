            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) logically follows from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow B \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) (the inverse) from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) (the original statement).\n\nAnswer: no",
