            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train' from 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"Sam did not take a plane\"\n     - And \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"Erin did not take a train\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between these statements.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n   - However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\); it is the inverse.\n\n4. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
