The given statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n     where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n\n3. To check the validity of this inference, we need to understand the contrapositive of the given statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n   - The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. The statement \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow C \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement.\n   - The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) directly from \\( A \\rightarrow C \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
