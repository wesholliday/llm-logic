The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\), we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive in logic.\n   - The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n   - The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) is true, then \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is also true.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow M \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement.\n   - The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
