            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta' from 'If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n     where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"Sue did not choose pizza\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between these statements.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n   - However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\); it is a different statement known as the inverse.\n\n4. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
