            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mary was not at the wedding\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) implies \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between these statements.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n   - However, \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow S \\); it is the inverse.\n\n4. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) does not imply \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nBased on this logical analysis, we cannot infer 'If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.'\n\nAnswer: no",
