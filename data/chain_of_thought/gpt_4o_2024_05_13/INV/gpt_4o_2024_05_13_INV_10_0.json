The original statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n     where \\( D \\) represents \"the dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n     where \\( \\neg D \\) represents \"the dog was not inside\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the cat was not outside.\"\n\n3. To check if \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) can be inferred from \\( D \\rightarrow C \\), we need to understand the contrapositive of the original statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) is \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\).\n   - The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. The statement \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( D \\rightarrow C \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement.\n   - The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) from \\( D \\rightarrow C \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
