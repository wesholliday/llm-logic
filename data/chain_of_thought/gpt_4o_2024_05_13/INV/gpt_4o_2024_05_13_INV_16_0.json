            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim' from 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', we need to understand the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the shirt was not cotton\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the pants were not denim.\"\n\n3. The logical relationship between \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is known as the contrapositive. However, the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is actually \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), not \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\n4. Therefore, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not logically imply \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). Instead, it implies \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot infer 'If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim' from 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim'.\n\nAnswer: no",
