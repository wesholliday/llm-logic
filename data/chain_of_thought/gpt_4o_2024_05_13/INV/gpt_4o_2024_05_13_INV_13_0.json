            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the car was not red\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the truck was not blue.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) logically follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) (the inverse) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (the original statement).\n\nAnswer: no",
