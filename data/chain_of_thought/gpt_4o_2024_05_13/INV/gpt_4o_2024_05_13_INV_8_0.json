            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake' from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   - Where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg V \\) represents \"the vampire was not awake\" and \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"the mummy was not awake.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) can be inferred from \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between these statements.\n   - The original statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) means that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n\n4. However, the statement \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( V \\rightarrow M \\). Instead, it is the inverse.\n   - The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. In fact, \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is not a valid inference from \\( V \\rightarrow M \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake' from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake'.\n\nAnswer: no",
