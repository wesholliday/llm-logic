            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the doll was not plastic\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the truck was not metal.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between these statements.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n   - However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive; it is the inverse of the original statement.\n\n4. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
