            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis' from 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy played tennis (Q).\" This can be written as P \u2192 Q.\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If Jeff did not play basketball (\u00acP), then Amy did not play tennis (\u00acQ).\" This can be written as \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, which is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is not the contrapositive; it is the inverse of the original statement.\n\nThe inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ from P \u2192 Q.\n\nAnswer: no",
