            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball' from 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\)\n   where \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"Tom did not watch football\" and \\( \\neg J \\) represents \"Jen did not watch basketball\".\n\n3. To determine if \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) implies \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between these statements. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( T \\rightarrow J \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) from \\( T \\rightarrow J \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
