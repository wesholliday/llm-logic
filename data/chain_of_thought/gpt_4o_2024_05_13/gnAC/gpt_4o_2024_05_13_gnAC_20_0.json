The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"The apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( B \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if \\( A \\) (The apple was red) necessarily follows from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nIn logic, the truth of \\( B \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( A \\). The conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) only tells us that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must be true. However, \\( B \\) being true does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( A \\). \\( B \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( A \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( A \\) (The apple was red) is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
