The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The book was written by James) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply that \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). In other words, just because \\( Q \\) is true, it does not mean that \\( P \\) must be true. The truth of \\( Q \\) only confirms that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would also be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot conclude that 'The book was written by James' is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
