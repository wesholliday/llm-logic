The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Kate ate salad.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Ben ate pasta) is necessarily true given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\). The conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( P \\). \\( Q \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( P \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that 'Ben ate pasta' is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
