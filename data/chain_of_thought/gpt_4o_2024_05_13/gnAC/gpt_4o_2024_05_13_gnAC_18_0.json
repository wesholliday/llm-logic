The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was metal.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (the doll was plastic) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply that \\( P \\) is true just because \\( Q \\) is true. The truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( P \\). \\( Q \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( P \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that 'The doll was plastic' is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
