The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( C \\) represents \"The cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( C \\) (The cake was chocolate) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) does not imply that \\( C \\) is true just because \\( M \\) is true. The truth of \\( M \\) does not provide any information about the truth of \\( C \\). The conditional statement only tells us what happens if \\( C \\) is true, not what happens if \\( M \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( C \\) (The cake was chocolate) is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
