The first statement is a conditional: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Sue chose pizza) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply that \\( P \\) is true if \\( Q \\) is true. The truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not provide information about the truth of \\( P \\). The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not mean \\( P \\) must be true; \\( Q \\) could be true for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that 'Sue chose pizza' is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
