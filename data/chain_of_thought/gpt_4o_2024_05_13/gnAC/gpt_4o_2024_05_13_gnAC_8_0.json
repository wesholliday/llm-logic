The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( V \\) represents \"The vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The mummy was awake.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( V \\) (the vampire was awake) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) tells us that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true.\n- The statement \\( M \\) is true tells us that the mummy was indeed awake.\n\nHowever, the truth of \\( M \\) alone does not provide information about \\( V \\). The conditional statement does not imply that \\( V \\) must be true if \\( M \\) is true. It only tells us what happens if \\( V \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( V \\) is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
