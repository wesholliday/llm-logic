            "content": "To determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is necessarily true, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( M \\) (Mary was at the wedding) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, the conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) means that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if \\( S \\) is true. The truth of \\( S \\) alone does not imply the truth of \\( M \\). \n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- If the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" is true, and we know \"the ground is wet,\" it does not necessarily mean \"it is raining\" because the ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., someone watered the garden).\n\nTherefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. \n\nAnswer: no",
