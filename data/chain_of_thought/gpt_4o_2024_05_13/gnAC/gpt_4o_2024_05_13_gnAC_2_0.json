The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n   where \\( G \\) represents \"The griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( U \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( G \\) (the griffin was in the forest) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) tells us that if \\( G \\) is true, then \\( U \\) must be true.\n- The statement \\( U \\) is true, but this does not provide any information about \\( G \\). The truth of \\( U \\) does not imply that \\( G \\) must be true because \\( U \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( G \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, the truth of \\( U \\) alone does not allow us to conclude that \\( G \\) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
