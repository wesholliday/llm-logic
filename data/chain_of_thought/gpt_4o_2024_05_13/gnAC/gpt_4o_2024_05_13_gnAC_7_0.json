The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written as:\n   - If A, then C (A \u2192 C)\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Chris finished the race.\" This can be written as:\n   - C is true\n\nWe need to determine if A (Alex finished the race) is necessarily true given these statements.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The conditional statement (A \u2192 C) tells us that if A is true, then C must be true.\n- The second statement tells us that C is true.\n\nHowever, the truth of C does not provide any information about the truth of A. The conditional statement (A \u2192 C) does not imply that A must be true if C is true. It only tells us what happens if A is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that A (Alex finished the race) is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
