The first statement is a conditional: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( D \\) represents \"The dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"The cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cat was outside.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( C \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( D \\) (The dog was inside) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\n3. The conditional statement \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) tells us that if \\( D \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be true. However, it does not provide information about what happens if \\( C \\) is true. The truth of \\( C \\) does not imply the truth of \\( D \\); it only tells us that if \\( D \\) were true, then \\( C \\) would be true.\n\n4. Since \\( C \\) is true, it satisfies the condition of the implication \\( D \\rightarrow C \\), but it does not provide any information about \\( D \\). \\( D \\) could be true or false independently of \\( C \\) being true.\n\nTherefore, the truth of \"The cat was outside\" does not necessarily imply that \"The dog was inside.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
