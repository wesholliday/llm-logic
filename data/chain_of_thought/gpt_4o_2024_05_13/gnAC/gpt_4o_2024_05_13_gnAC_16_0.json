The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The pants were denim.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The shirt was cotton) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply that \\( P \\) is true just because \\( Q \\) is true. The truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not provide information about the truth of \\( P \\). The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not mean that \\( P \\) must be true; \\( Q \\) could be true for other reasons unrelated to \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \"The shirt was cotton\" is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
