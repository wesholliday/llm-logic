The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Amy played tennis.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) tells us that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must be true.\n- The statement \\( A \\) is true tells us that Amy played tennis.\n\nHowever, the truth of \\( A \\) alone does not provide information about \\( J \\). The conditional statement does not imply that \\( J \\) must be true if \\( A \\) is true. It only tells us what happens if \\( J \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
