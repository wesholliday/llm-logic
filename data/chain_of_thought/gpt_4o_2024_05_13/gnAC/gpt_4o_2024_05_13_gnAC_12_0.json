The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply that \\( P \\) is true if \\( Q \\) is true. The truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not provide any information about the truth of \\( P \\). The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not mean that \\( P \\) must be true; \\( Q \\) could be true for other reasons unrelated to \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that 'Joe went to the park' is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
