The original statement is: \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow G \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents \"the tizzer is on\" and \\( G \\) represents \"the goom is snurpled.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (T \\land P) \\rightarrow G \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the plink light is out.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (T \\land P) \\rightarrow G \\) from \\( T \\rightarrow G \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( P \\) (the plink light being out) affects the original implication.\n\n- The original statement \\( T \\rightarrow G \\) tells us that whenever \\( T \\) is true, \\( G \\) must also be true.\n- Adding the condition \\( P \\) (the plink light is out) does not change the fact that \\( T \\rightarrow G \\). The truth of \\( G \\) still depends only on \\( T \\) being true, regardless of \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, the additional condition \\( P \\) does not affect the original implication, and we can still conclude that \\( G \\) will be true if \\( T \\) is true, even if \\( P \\) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
