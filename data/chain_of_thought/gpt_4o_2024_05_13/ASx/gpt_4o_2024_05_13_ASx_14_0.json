The original statement is: \"If the frizzle is dinked, then the zarp will splunk.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( F \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   - Where \\( F \\) represents \"the frizzle is dinked\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"the zarp will splunk.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped, then the zarp will splunk.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (F \\land S) \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the sklonk is grooped.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (F \\land S) \\rightarrow Z \\) from \\( F \\rightarrow Z \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( S \\) (the sklonk is grooped) affects the outcome.\n\n- The original statement \\( F \\rightarrow Z \\) tells us that whenever \\( F \\) is true, \\( Z \\) must be true.\n- The new statement \\( (F \\land S) \\rightarrow Z \\) tells us that whenever both \\( F \\) and \\( S \\) are true, \\( Z \\) must be true.\n\nSince \\( F \\rightarrow Z \\) already guarantees that \\( Z \\) will be true whenever \\( F \\) is true, adding the condition \\( S \\) does not change the outcome. The truth of \\( Z \\) is still guaranteed by the truth of \\( F \\), regardless of \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \\( (F \\land S) \\rightarrow Z \\) from \\( F \\rightarrow Z \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
