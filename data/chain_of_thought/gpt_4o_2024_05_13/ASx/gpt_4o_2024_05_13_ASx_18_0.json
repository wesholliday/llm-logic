The original statement is: \"If the zonk is twiddled, then it will pluzzle.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: Twiddled(Z) \u2192 Pluzzle(Z)\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the zonk is twiddled and it is blorped, then it will pluzzle.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: (Twiddled(Z) \u2227 Blorped(Z)) \u2192 Pluzzle(Z)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\n- The original statement (Twiddled(Z) \u2192 Pluzzle(Z)) tells us that twiddling the zonk is sufficient for it to pluzzle.\n- The statement we want to infer ((Twiddled(Z) \u2227 Blorped(Z)) \u2192 Pluzzle(Z)) adds an additional condition (Blorped(Z)) to the antecedent.\n\nIn logic, if a condition (Twiddled(Z)) is sufficient to cause an outcome (Pluzzle(Z)), then adding more conditions to the antecedent (such as Blorped(Z)) does not change the sufficiency of the original condition. Therefore, if Twiddled(Z) alone is enough to ensure Pluzzle(Z), then Twiddled(Z) combined with any other condition (like Blorped(Z)) will also ensure Pluzzle(Z).\n\nThus, we can infer that if the zonk is twiddled and it is blorped, then it will pluzzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
