The original statement is: \"If the klonk is fizzered, then the meeping will nurple.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"the klonk is fizzered\" and \\( B \\) is \"the meeping will nurple.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the klonk is fizzered and the splat dangles, then the meeping will nurple.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (A \\land C) \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) is \"the splat dangles.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (A \\land C) \\rightarrow B \\) from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( C \\) (the splat dangles) affects the outcome.\n\n- The original statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) tells us that whenever \\( A \\) is true, \\( B \\) must be true.\n- Adding \\( C \\) to the condition does not change the fact that \\( A \\) being true implies \\( B \\) is true. The presence of \\( C \\) does not negate or alter the relationship between \\( A \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nTherefore, the statement \\( (A \\land C) \\rightarrow B \\) logically follows from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
