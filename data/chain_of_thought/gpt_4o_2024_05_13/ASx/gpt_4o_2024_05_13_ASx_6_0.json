            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs' from 'If you glurp, it will hurt my snarfs', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: 'If you glurp, it will hurt my snarfs.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\text{Glurp} \\rightarrow \\text{Hurt my snarfs} \\)\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: 'If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (\\text{Glurp} \\land \\text{Wearing plorks}) \\rightarrow \\text{Hurt my snarfs} \\)\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we need to check if the first statement logically implies the second.\n\n- The first statement says that glurping is a sufficient condition for hurting snarfs.\n- The second statement adds an additional condition (wearing plorks) to the glurping.\n\nIn logical terms, if \\( \\text{Glurp} \\rightarrow \\text{Hurt my snarfs} \\) is true, then adding an additional condition (wearing plorks) to the antecedent (glurping) does not change the fact that glurping alone is sufficient to hurt snarfs. Therefore, the presence of the additional condition (wearing plorks) does not affect the outcome.\n\nThus, the second statement can be inferred from the first because the additional condition does not negate the original sufficient condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
