The original statement is: \"If you bringle the splotch, then the bloop will floosh.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"you bringle the splotch\" and \\( B \\) is \"the bloop will floosh.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If you bringle the splotch and the crungle is splooted, then the bloop will floosh.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (A \\land C) \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) is \"the crungle is splooted.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (A \\land C) \\rightarrow B \\) from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( C \\) (the crungle is splooted) affects the outcome.\n\n- The original statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) tells us that whenever \\( A \\) is true, \\( B \\) will be true.\n- The new statement \\( (A \\land C) \\rightarrow B \\) adds an extra condition \\( C \\) to \\( A \\).\n\nHowever, the truth of \\( B \\) (the bloop will floosh) is already guaranteed by \\( A \\) (you bringle the splotch) alone, regardless of \\( C \\). Therefore, adding \\( C \\) does not change the outcome because \\( A \\) alone is sufficient to ensure \\( B \\).\n\nThus, we can infer that if you bringle the splotch and the crungle is splooted, then the bloop will floosh, because the additional condition \\( C \\) does not affect the truth of \\( B \\) given \\( A \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
