            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped' from 'If the snark was blimmed, then it flooped', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: 'If the snark was blimmed, then it flooped.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow F \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents 'the snark was blimmed' and \\( F \\) represents 'it flooped'.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: 'If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (B \\land S) \\rightarrow F \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents 'the snark was sproinged'.\n\nTo infer \\( (B \\land S) \\rightarrow F \\) from \\( B \\rightarrow F \\), we need to check if the truth of \\( B \\rightarrow F \\) guarantees the truth of \\( (B \\land S) \\rightarrow F \\).\n\n3. Let's consider the truth table for \\( B \\rightarrow F \\):\n   - \\( B \\) | \\( F \\) | \\( B \\rightarrow F \\)\n   - T   | T   | T\n   - T   | F   | F\n   - F   | T   | T\n   - F   | F   | T\n\n4. Now, let's consider the truth table for \\( (B \\land S) \\rightarrow F \\):\n   - \\( B \\) | \\( S \\) | \\( F \\) | \\( B \\land S \\) | \\( (B \\land S) \\rightarrow F \\)\n   - T   | T   | T   | T          | T\n   - T   | T   | F   | T          | F\n   - T   | F   | T   | F          | T\n   - T   | F   | F   | F          | T\n   - F   | T   | T   | F          | T\n   - F   | T   | F   | F          | T\n   - F   | F   | T   | F          | T\n   - F   | F   | F   | F          | T\n\n5. From the truth tables, we see that \\( (B \\land S) \\rightarrow F \\) is true in all cases where \\( B \\rightarrow F \\) is true. This is because if \\( B \\) is false, \\( (B \\land S) \\) is also false, making \\( (B \\land S) \\rightarrow F \\) true by default. If \\( B \\) is true, then \\( F \\) must be true for \\( B \\rightarrow F \\) to hold, which also makes \\( (B \\land S) \\rightarrow F \\) true regardless of \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the snark was blimmed and sproinged, then it flooped' from 'If the snark was blimmed, then it flooped'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
