The original statement is: \"If the ploofle is blorped, then the fliggle will get a nurple.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow N \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the ploofle is blorped\" and \\( N \\) represents \"the fliggle will get a nurple.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the ploofle is blorped and zooned, then the fliggle will get a nurple.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (P \\land Z) \\rightarrow N \\)\n   - Where \\( Z \\) represents \"the ploofle is zooned.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (P \\land Z) \\rightarrow N \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow N \\), we need to check if the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) guarantees the truth of \\( (P \\land Z) \\rightarrow N \\).\n\n3. Let's analyze the logical implications:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) means that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( N \\) must also be true.\n   - \\( (P \\land Z) \\rightarrow N \\) means that whenever both \\( P \\) and \\( Z \\) are true, \\( N \\) must be true.\n\n4. If \\( P \\) is true, then \\( N \\) must be true according to \\( P \\rightarrow N \\). The additional condition \\( Z \\) being true does not change the fact that \\( P \\) being true implies \\( N \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) does indeed guarantee the truth of \\( (P \\land Z) \\rightarrow N \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
