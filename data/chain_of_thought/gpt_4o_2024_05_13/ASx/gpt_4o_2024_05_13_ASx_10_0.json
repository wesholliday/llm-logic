The original statement is: \"If the klank is hooped, then the wuggy will zink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( K \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   - Where \\( K \\) represents \"the klank is hooped\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"the wuggy will zink.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the klank is hooped and the wuggy is out of zloat, then the wuggy will zink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (K \\land \\neg L) \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   - Where \\( K \\) represents \"the klank is hooped,\" \\( \\neg L \\) represents \"the wuggy is out of zloat,\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"the wuggy will zink.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (K \\land \\neg L) \\rightarrow Z \\) from \\( K \\rightarrow Z \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( \\neg L \\) (the wuggy is out of zloat) affects the original implication.\n\n- The original statement \\( K \\rightarrow Z \\) means that whenever \\( K \\) is true, \\( Z \\) must also be true, regardless of any other conditions.\n- Adding the condition \\( \\neg L \\) does not change the fact that \\( K \\) being true implies \\( Z \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the additional condition \\( \\neg L \\) does not affect the original implication, and we can still conclude that if \\( K \\) is true, \\( Z \\) will be true, even if \\( \\neg L \\) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
