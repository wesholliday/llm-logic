The original statement is: \"If the glop is on the brink, then the skrizzle is plonked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( G \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( G \\) represents \"the glop is on the brink\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the skrizzle is plonked.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the glop is on the brink and the bloop is zorped, then the skrizzle is plonked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (G \\land B) \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the bloop is zorped.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (G \\land B) \\rightarrow S \\) from \\( G \\rightarrow S \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( B \\) (the bloop is zorped) affects the outcome.\n\n- The original statement \\( G \\rightarrow S \\) tells us that whenever \\( G \\) is true, \\( S \\) must be true.\n- The new statement \\( (G \\land B) \\rightarrow S \\) tells us that whenever both \\( G \\) and \\( B \\) are true, \\( S \\) must be true.\n\nSince \\( G \\rightarrow S \\) already guarantees that \\( S \\) is true whenever \\( G \\) is true, adding the condition \\( B \\) does not change the outcome. Therefore, \\( (G \\land B) \\rightarrow S \\) is still valid because \\( G \\) being true is sufficient to ensure \\( S \\) is true, regardless of \\( B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
