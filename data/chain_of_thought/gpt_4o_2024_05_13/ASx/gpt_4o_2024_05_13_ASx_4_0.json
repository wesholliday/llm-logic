The original statement is: \"If the zink is in the snaffle, then it is tinking.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"the zink is in the snaffle\" and \\( B \\) is \"it is tinking.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the zink is in the snaffle and it is bazoogled, then it is tinking.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (A \\land C) \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) is \"it is bazoogled.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (A \\land C) \\rightarrow B \\) from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( C \\) (it is bazoogled) affects the truth of \\( B \\) (it is tinking).\n\n- The original statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) tells us that whenever \\( A \\) is true, \\( B \\) must be true.\n- The new statement \\( (A \\land C) \\rightarrow B \\) adds an extra condition \\( C \\) to \\( A \\).\n\nHowever, the truth of \\( B \\) (it is tinking) is already guaranteed by \\( A \\) (the zink is in the snaffle) alone, regardless of whether \\( C \\) (it is bazoogled) is true or false. Therefore, adding \\( C \\) does not change the outcome that \\( B \\) must be true if \\( A \\) is true.\n\nThus, we can infer \\( (A \\land C) \\rightarrow B \\) from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
