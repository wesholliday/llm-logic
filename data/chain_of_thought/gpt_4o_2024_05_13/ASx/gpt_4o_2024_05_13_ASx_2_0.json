The original statement is: \"If we crink the snoogle, then we'll plook a nurp.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\text{crink the snoogle} \\rightarrow \\text{plook a nurp} \\).\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If we crink the snoogle and a wug zites, then we'll plook a nurp.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (\\text{crink the snoogle} \\land \\text{a wug zites}) \\rightarrow \\text{plook a nurp} \\).\n\nTo infer the second statement from the first, we need to check if the second statement logically follows from the first. \n\n- The first statement tells us that crinking the snoogle is a sufficient condition for plooking a nurp.\n- The second statement adds an additional condition (a wug zites) to the sufficient condition (crink the snoogle).\n\nIn logic, if \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is true, then \\( (A \\land C) \\rightarrow B \\) is also true because adding an additional condition \\( C \\) does not change the fact that \\( A \\) is sufficient for \\( B \\).\n\nTherefore, the second statement logically follows from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
