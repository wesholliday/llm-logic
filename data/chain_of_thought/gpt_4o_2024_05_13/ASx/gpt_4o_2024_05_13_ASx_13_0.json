The original statement is: \"If the quop is in the blarf, then it becomes gloobed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow G \\)\n   - Where \\( Q \\) represents \"the quop is in the blarf\" and \\( G \\) represents \"it becomes gloobed.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the quop is in the blarf and the blarf is twinkling, then it becomes gloobed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (Q \\land T) \\rightarrow G \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents \"the blarf is twinkling.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (Q \\land T) \\rightarrow G \\) from \\( Q \\rightarrow G \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( T \\) (the blarf is twinkling) affects the outcome.\n\n- The original statement \\( Q \\rightarrow G \\) tells us that whenever \\( Q \\) is true, \\( G \\) must be true.\n- Adding the condition \\( T \\) does not change the fact that \\( Q \\) being true implies \\( G \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, if \\( Q \\) is true (the quop is in the blarf), then \\( G \\) (it becomes gloobed) must be true regardless of whether \\( T \\) (the blarf is twinkling) is true or not.\n\nThus, the statement \\( (Q \\land T) \\rightarrow G \\) logically follows from \\( Q \\rightarrow G \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
