The original statement is: 'If the trankle is sploofed, then the zorple will quibble.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents 'the trankle is sploofed' and \\( Z \\) represents 'the zorple will quibble'.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: 'If the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (T \\land D) \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   - Where \\( D \\) represents 'the drib is flanked'.\n\nTo infer \\( (T \\land D) \\rightarrow Z \\) from \\( T \\rightarrow Z \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( D \\) (the drib is flanked) affects the outcome.\n\n- The original statement \\( T \\rightarrow Z \\) tells us that whenever \\( T \\) is true, \\( Z \\) must be true.\n- The new statement \\( (T \\land D) \\rightarrow Z \\) tells us that whenever both \\( T \\) and \\( D \\) are true, \\( Z \\) must be true.\n\nSince \\( T \\rightarrow Z \\) already guarantees that \\( Z \\) will be true whenever \\( T \\) is true, adding the condition \\( D \\) does not change the outcome. Therefore, \\( (T \\land D) \\rightarrow Z \\) is logically consistent with \\( T \\rightarrow Z \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
