The original statement is: \"If the plim is grobbled, then the whiffle will sploosh.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow W \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the plim is grobbled\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the whiffle will sploosh.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (P \\land D) \\rightarrow W \\)\n   - Where \\( D \\) represents \"the drazzle is drooped.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (P \\land D) \\rightarrow W \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow W \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( D \\) (the drazzle is drooped) affects the outcome.\n\n- The original statement \\( P \\rightarrow W \\) tells us that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( W \\) must be true.\n- The new statement \\( (P \\land D) \\rightarrow W \\) tells us that whenever both \\( P \\) and \\( D \\) are true, \\( W \\) must be true.\n\nSince \\( P \\rightarrow W \\) already guarantees that \\( W \\) will be true whenever \\( P \\) is true, adding an additional condition \\( D \\) does not change the outcome. Therefore, \\( (P \\land D) \\rightarrow W \\) is logically consistent with \\( P \\rightarrow W \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
