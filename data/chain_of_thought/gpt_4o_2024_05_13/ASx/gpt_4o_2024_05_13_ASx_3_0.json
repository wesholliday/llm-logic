The original statement is: \"If the fribble is in the snarp, then it is flugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the fribble is in the snarp\" and \\( Q \\) is \"it is flugged.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the fribble is in the snarp and the snarp is flooping, then it is flugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( R \\) is \"the snarp is flooping.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( R \\) (the snarp is flooping) affects the original implication.\n\n- The original implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) states that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- Adding \\( R \\) to the antecedent (the condition part) does not change the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). If \\( P \\) alone implies \\( Q \\), then \\( P \\) combined with any other condition \\( R \\) will still imply \\( Q \\).\n\nTherefore, the additional condition \\( R \\) does not affect the validity of the original implication. The statement \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically valid given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
