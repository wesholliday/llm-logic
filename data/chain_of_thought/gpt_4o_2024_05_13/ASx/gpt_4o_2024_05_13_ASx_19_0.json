Original statement: 'If the krimp is in the zool, then the snarf will be glonked.'\n   - This can be written as: If K (krimp in the zool), then S (snarf will be glonked).\n   - Symbolically: K \u2192 S\n\n2. New statement to infer: 'If the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will be glonked.'\n   - This can be written as: If K (krimp in the zool) and Z (zool is zapped), then S (snarf will be glonked).\n   - Symbolically: (K \u2227 Z) \u2192 S\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship:\n- The original statement (K \u2192 S) tells us that whenever K is true, S must be true.\n- The new statement (K \u2227 Z) \u2192 S adds an additional condition (Z) to the antecedent.\n\nTo infer the new statement from the original, we need to check if the additional condition (Z) affects the truth of the conclusion (S). Since the original statement (K \u2192 S) guarantees that S is true whenever K is true, adding an additional condition (Z) does not change the fact that S will be true if K is true.\n\nTherefore, the new statement (K \u2227 Z) \u2192 S is logically consistent with the original statement (K \u2192 S).\n\nAnswer: yes",
