The original statement is: \"If the zibble is zapped, then the glorp will zoon.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Z \\rightarrow G \\)\n   - Where \\( Z \\) represents \"the zibble is zapped\" and \\( G \\) represents \"the glorp will zoon.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (Z \\land Q) \\rightarrow G \\)\n   - Where \\( Q \\) represents \"the quib is squinked.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (Z \\land Q) \\rightarrow G \\) from \\( Z \\rightarrow G \\), we need to check if the truth of \\( Z \\rightarrow G \\) guarantees the truth of \\( (Z \\land Q) \\rightarrow G \\).\n\n- \\( Z \\rightarrow G \\) means that whenever \\( Z \\) is true, \\( G \\) must also be true.\n- \\( (Z \\land Q) \\rightarrow G \\) means that whenever both \\( Z \\) and \\( Q \\) are true, \\( G \\) must be true.\n\nSince \\( Z \\rightarrow G \\) already ensures that \\( G \\) is true whenever \\( Z \\) is true, adding an additional condition \\( Q \\) (whether true or false) does not change the outcome for \\( G \\). Therefore, \\( (Z \\land Q) \\rightarrow G \\) is logically consistent with \\( Z \\rightarrow G \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
