The original statement is: \"If the glunk snarbles, then the blip will be floinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( G \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( G \\) represents \"the glunk snarbles\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the blip will be floinked.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the glunk snarbles and the troon is zibbled, then the blip will be floinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (G \\land T) \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents \"the troon is zibbled.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (G \\land T) \\rightarrow B \\) from \\( G \\rightarrow B \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( T \\) (the troon is zibbled) affects the outcome.\n\n- The original statement \\( G \\rightarrow B \\) tells us that whenever \\( G \\) is true, \\( B \\) must be true.\n- The new statement \\( (G \\land T) \\rightarrow B \\) tells us that whenever both \\( G \\) and \\( T \\) are true, \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nSince \\( G \\rightarrow B \\) already guarantees that \\( B \\) will be true whenever \\( G \\) is true, adding the condition \\( T \\) does not change the outcome. Therefore, \\( (G \\land T) \\rightarrow B \\) is still valid because \\( G \\) being true is sufficient to ensure \\( B \\) is true, regardless of \\( T \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
