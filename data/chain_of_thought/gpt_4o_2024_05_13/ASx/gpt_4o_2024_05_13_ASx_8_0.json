The original statement is: \"If the plink has morphed, then it will tizzle.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow T \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the plink has morphed\" and \\( T \\) represents \"it will tizzle.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the plink has morphed and it was misglommed, then it will tizzle.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (P \\land M) \\rightarrow T \\)\n   - Where \\( M \\) represents \"it was misglommed.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (P \\land M) \\rightarrow T \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow T \\), we need to check if the additional condition \\( M \\) (it was misglommed) affects the outcome \\( T \\) (it will tizzle).\n\n- The original statement \\( P \\rightarrow T \\) tells us that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( T \\) must be true.\n- The additional condition \\( M \\) does not change the fact that \\( P \\) being true implies \\( T \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, adding the condition \\( M \\) does not affect the logical relationship between \\( P \\) and \\( T \\). The statement \\( (P \\land M) \\rightarrow T \\) is still valid because \\( P \\) alone is sufficient to ensure \\( T \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
