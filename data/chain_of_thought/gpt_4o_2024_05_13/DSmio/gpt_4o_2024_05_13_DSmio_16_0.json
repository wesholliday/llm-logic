It does not definitively state that the pen is not on the desk, only that it might not be.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n     a. The pen is in my bag.\n     b. The pen is on my desk.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the pen is not on the desk.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag (because the \"or\" statement requires at least one of the conditions to be true).\n\nGiven that Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the pen is not on the desk, and Statement 2 states that if the pen is not on the desk, it must be in the bag, we can infer that the pen must be in the bag if it is not on the desk.\n\nHowever, Statement 1 does not definitively state that the pen is not on the desk; it only suggests the possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the pen is in the bag based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
