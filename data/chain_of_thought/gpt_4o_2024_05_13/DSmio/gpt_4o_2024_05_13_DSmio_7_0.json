However, it does not definitively state that the umbrella is not in the closet; it only suggests a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n     - The umbrella is in the car.\n     - The umbrella is tucked away in the closet.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the umbrella is not in the car, then it must be in the closet.\n- Statement 1 suggests that it is possible the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\nIf the umbrella is not in the closet (as suggested by Statement 1), then according to Statement 2, the only remaining possibility is that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the umbrella must be in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
