It does not definitively state that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n     - The cat is napping on the couch.\n     - The cat is playing in the bedroom.\n\n3. **Combining the Statements:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the cat is not playing in the bedroom.\n   - From Statement 2, if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, then the only remaining possibility is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\n4. **Inference:**\n   - Since Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, and Statement 2 states that if the cat is not playing in the bedroom, it must be napping on the couch, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
