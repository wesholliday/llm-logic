It does not definitively state that Fido is not in the garden, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n   - This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n     - Fido is inside.\n     - Fido must be in the garden.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if Fido is not inside, then Fido must be in the garden.\n\nGiven that it is possible that Fido is not in the garden (Statement 1), and if Fido is not inside, then Fido must be in the garden (Statement 2), the only way to reconcile these statements is if Fido is inside. Otherwise, there would be a contradiction because Fido would have to be in the garden if he is not inside, but Statement 1 allows for the possibility that Fido is not in the garden.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
