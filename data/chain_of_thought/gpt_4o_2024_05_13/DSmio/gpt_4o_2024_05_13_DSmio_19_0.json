It does not definitively state that the watch is not on his wrist, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the watch is charging on the dresser, or it is on his wrist.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the watch is not on his wrist.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser (because the \"or\" statement requires at least one of the conditions to be true).\n\nGiven that it is possible (but not certain) that the watch is not on his wrist, and knowing that if it is not on his wrist, it must be charging on the dresser, we can infer that the watch could be charging on the dresser. However, we cannot definitively conclude that it is charging on the dresser because Statement 1 only suggests a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
