This can be broken down into two separate requirements:\n1. The plimp must be fizzle snork.\n2. The plimp must blimp frazzle.\n\nWhen we combine these two requirements into a single statement, we get: 'The plimp must be fizzle snork and blimp frazzle'. This combined statement maintains the same meaning as the original statement, as it still requires the plimp to meet both conditions.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The plimp must be fizzle snork and blimp frazzle' from 'The plimp must be fizzle snork and it must blimp frazzle'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
