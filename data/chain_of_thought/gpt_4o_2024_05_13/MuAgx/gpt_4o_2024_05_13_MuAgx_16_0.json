This can be broken down into two parts:\n1. The flibbit must be quibble crunk.\n2. The flibbit must snork zooble wozzle.\n\nThe inferred statement is: 'The flibbit must be quibble crunk and snork zooble wozzle'. This combines the two requirements into a single statement.\n\nSince the original statement explicitly states both conditions (quibble crunk and snork zooble wozzle) separately, combining them into a single statement does not change the meaning. Both conditions still apply to the flibbit.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the combined statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
