The original statement is: 'The glorp must be wobble and it must be zooble.'\n2. This can be broken down into two separate conditions:\n   - The glorp must be wobble.\n   - The glorp must be zooble.\n\n3. When we combine these two conditions, we get: 'The glorp must be wobble and zooble.'\n\nTherefore, the combined statement 'The glorp must be wobble and zooble' logically follows from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
