This can be broken down into two parts:\n1. The quorple must be at snork gribble.\n2. The quorple must be in the wibble plonk.\n\nThe inferred statement is: 'The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk'. This statement combines the two conditions into a single sentence.\n\nBoth statements convey the same requirements for the quorple: it must be at snork gribble and it must be in the wibble plonk. The inferred statement is simply a more concise way of expressing the same information.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
