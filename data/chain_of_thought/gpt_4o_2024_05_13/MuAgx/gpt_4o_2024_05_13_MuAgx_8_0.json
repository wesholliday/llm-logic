'The gribble must be flim on snork'\n2. 'It must blimple quazzle flim'\n\nThese two parts are connected by the conjunction 'and', indicating that both conditions must be true simultaneously.\n\nThe inferred statement 'The gribble must be flim on snork and blimple quazzle flim' combines the two conditions into a single statement using 'and'. This is essentially a rephrasing of the original statement, maintaining the same logical structure and meaning.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement accurately represents the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
