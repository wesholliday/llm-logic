This statement does not provide any information about 'blimp quank' or any additional conditions or actions.\n\nTo infer the extended statement, 'The flimble might be grazzle by glorp and be blimp quank', we would need additional information that links 'blimp quank' to the original scenario. Since the original statement does not mention 'blimp quank' or provide any context that would allow us to logically connect 'blimp quank' to 'grazzle by glorp', we cannot make this inference.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, we cannot infer the extended statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
