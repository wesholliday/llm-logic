The original statement is 'The blimp might be zooble'. This means there is a possibility that the blimp is zooble.\n2. The second statement we are trying to infer is 'The blimp might be zooble and be blurble by froodle'. This statement combines two possibilities:\n   - The blimp might be zooble.\n   - The blimp might be blurble by froodle.\n\nThe original statement only addresses the possibility of the blimp being zooble. It does not provide any information about the blimp being blurble by froodle. Therefore, we cannot infer the combined statement 'The blimp might be zooble and be blurble by froodle' solely based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
