The original statement is 'The wumble might be plonk flump'. This indicates a possibility that the wumble could be described as 'plonk flump'.\n2. The new statement we want to infer is 'The wumble might be plonk flump and snork zibber quank'. This statement suggests that the wumble could simultaneously be described as both 'plonk flump' and 'snork zibber quank'.\n\nTo infer the new statement from the original, we need to establish that the possibility of the wumble being 'plonk flump' also implies the possibility of it being 'snork zibber quank'. However, the original statement does not provide any information about 'snork zibber quank'. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the wumble might also be 'snork zibber quank' based solely on the information given in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
