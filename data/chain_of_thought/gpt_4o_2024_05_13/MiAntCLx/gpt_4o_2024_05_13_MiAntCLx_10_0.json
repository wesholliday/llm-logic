The original statement is 'The snork might be bimboozle'. This means there is a possibility that 'The snork' has the property of being 'bimboozle'.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The snork might be bimboozle and grooble'. This means there is a possibility that 'The snork' has both properties: 'bimboozle' and 'grooble'.\n\nThe key point here is that the original statement only mentions the possibility of 'The snork' being 'bimboozle'. It does not provide any information about 'The snork' being 'grooble'. Therefore, we cannot infer the additional property 'grooble' from the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement does not mention 'grooble' at all, we cannot logically conclude that 'The snork' might be both 'bimboozle' and 'grooble' based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
