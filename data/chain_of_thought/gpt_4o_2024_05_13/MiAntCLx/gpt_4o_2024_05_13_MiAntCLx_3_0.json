The original statement is 'The zazzle might be in the quibble'. This means there is a possibility that the zazzle is located in the quibble.\n2. The statement we are trying to infer is 'The zazzle might be in the quibble and flump shimble'. This means there is a possibility that the zazzle is located in both the quibble and the flump shimble simultaneously.\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the possibility of the zazzle being in the quibble. It does not provide any information about the flump shimble. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the zazzle's location in the flump shimble from the original statement alone.\n\nSince the original statement does not mention the flump shimble at all, we cannot logically infer that the zazzle might be in both the quibble and the flump shimble.\n\nAnswer: no",
