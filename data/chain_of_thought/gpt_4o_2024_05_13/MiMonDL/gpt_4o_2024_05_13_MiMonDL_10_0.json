            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The computer might be broken or working' from 'The computer might be broken', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement 'The computer might be broken' suggests that there is a possibility that the computer is not functioning properly.\n2. The statement 'The computer might be broken or working' is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement) that covers all possible states of the computer: either it is broken or it is working.\n\nIn logic, if one part of a disjunction is true, the entire disjunction is true. Since 'The computer might be broken' is true, it implies that there is a possibility that the computer is in one of the two states mentioned in the disjunction (broken or working).\n\nTherefore, the statement 'The computer might be broken' logically supports the broader statement 'The computer might be broken or working' because it encompasses all possible states of the computer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
