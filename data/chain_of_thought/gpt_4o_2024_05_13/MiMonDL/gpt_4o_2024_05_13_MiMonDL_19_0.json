It does not provide information about other possible outcomes directly. However, in general, when considering the outcomes of a project, if there is a possibility of success, there is also typically a possibility of failure, unless explicitly stated otherwise. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that if a project might be successful, it also might fail, as these are the two primary outcomes of any project.\n\nAnswer: yes",
