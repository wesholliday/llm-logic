The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( C \\) represents \"The cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( M \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( C \\) (The cake was chocolate) from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\), we cannot directly infer \\( C \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) only tells us what happens if \\( C \\) is true, but it does not tell us what happens if \\( M \\) is true. \\( M \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( C \\) must be true; it only means that if \\( C \\) were true, then \\( M \\) would be true, which is already given.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that the cake was chocolate based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
