The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( S \\rightarrow P \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"The shirt was cotton\" and \\( P \\) represents \"The pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The shirt was cotton) from \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) means that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must also be true. However, knowing that \\( P \\) is true (the pants were denim) does not necessarily mean that \\( S \\) must be true. There could be other reasons why the pants were denim that do not involve the shirt being cotton.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
