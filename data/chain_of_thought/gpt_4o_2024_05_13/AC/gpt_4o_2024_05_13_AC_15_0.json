The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( S \\rightarrow E \\)\n   where \\( S \\) represents \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( E \\) represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Erin took a train.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( E \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if \\( S \\) (Sam took a plane) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) and \\( E \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) and \\( E \\), we cannot directly infer \\( S \\). The conditional statement \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) only tells us that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( E \\) must be true. However, knowing that \\( E \\) is true does not provide any information about whether \\( S \\) is true or false. \\( E \\) could be true regardless of \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Sam took a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
