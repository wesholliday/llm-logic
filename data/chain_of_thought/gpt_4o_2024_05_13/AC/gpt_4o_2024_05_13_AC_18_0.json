The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (\"The doll was plastic\") from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot directly infer \\( P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The truth of \\( Q \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\); \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The doll was plastic\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
