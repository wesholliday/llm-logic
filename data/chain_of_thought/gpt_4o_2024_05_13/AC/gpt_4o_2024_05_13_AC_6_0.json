The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (Sue chose pizza) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) means that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, it does not state that \\( P \\) must be true if \\( Q \\) is true. \\( Q \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true; \\( Q \\) could be true for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot infer \\( P \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
