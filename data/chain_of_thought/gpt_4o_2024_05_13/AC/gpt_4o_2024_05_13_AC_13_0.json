The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was blue.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( P \\) (\"The car was red\") can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot directly infer \\( P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true. There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The car was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
