The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Z \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) means that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Z \\) must also be true. However, it does not imply that \\( P \\) must be true if \\( Z \\) is true. The truth of \\( Z \\) alone does not provide any information about the truth of \\( P \\).\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Suppose the conditional statement is \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n- If we know \"the ground is wet,\" it does not necessarily mean \"it is raining\" because the ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., someone watered the garden).\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy went to the zoo,\" we cannot infer that \"Joe went to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
