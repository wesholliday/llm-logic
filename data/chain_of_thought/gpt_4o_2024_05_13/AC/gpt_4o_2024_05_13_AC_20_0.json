The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"The apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( B \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (The apple was red) from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\), we cannot directly infer \\( A \\). This is because the truth of \\( B \\) (the banana was yellow) does not necessarily mean that \\( A \\) (the apple was red) is true. \\( B \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( A \\).\n\nFor example, the banana could be yellow regardless of the color of the apple. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the apple is red, not that the apple being red is the only way for the banana to be yellow.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The apple was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
