The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( C \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (Alex finished the race) from these two statements.\n\n3. The conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) tells us that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if \\( C \\) is true. In other words, \\( C \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( A \\) is true.\n\n4. The second statement \\( C \\) tells us that Chris finished the race. However, this does not provide any information about whether Alex finished the race or not. The truth of \\( C \\) alone does not imply the truth of \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
