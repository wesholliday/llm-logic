The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( L \\) (Lisa bought the red shirt) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) means that if \\( L \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true. However, it does not imply that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( L \\) must be true. \\( M \\) being true does not provide any information about \\( L \\) on its own.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- If it rains (L), then the ground will be wet (M).\n- The ground is wet (M).\n\nFrom the fact that the ground is wet, we cannot conclude that it rained, as there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (e.g., someone watering the garden).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements:\n1. \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n2. \\( M \\)\n\nWe cannot infer \\( L \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
