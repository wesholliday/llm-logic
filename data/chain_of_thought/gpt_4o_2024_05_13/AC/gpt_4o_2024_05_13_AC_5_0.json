The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) means that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must also be true. However, it does not imply that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must be true. The truth of \\( A \\) alone does not provide any information about the truth of \\( J \\).\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and \"Amy played tennis,\" we cannot conclude that \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
