The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( D \\) represents \"The dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"The cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cat was outside.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( C \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( D \\) (The dog was inside) from \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( C \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( C \\), we cannot directly infer \\( D \\). The conditional statement \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) only tells us that if \\( D \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be true. However, knowing that \\( C \\) is true does not provide information about whether \\( D \\) is true or false. \\( C \\) could be true regardless of \\( D \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dog was inside\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
