The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( V \\) represents \"The vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( V \\) (The vampire was awake) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\), we cannot directly infer \\( V \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) only tells us that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true. However, \\( M \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( V \\) is true. \\( M \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( V \\) being true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The vampire was awake\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
