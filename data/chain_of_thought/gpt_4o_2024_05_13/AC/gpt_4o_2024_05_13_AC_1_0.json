            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( M \\) (Mary was at the wedding) from these two statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) means that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if \\( S \\) is true. Specifically, \\( S \\) being true does not necessarily imply that \\( M \\) is true. \n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Suppose \\( M \\) is false (Mary was not at the wedding). According to the conditional statement, if Mary was not at the wedding, the conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is still true as long as Sue was at the wedding (which we know is true from the second statement).\n\nTherefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding (\\( S \\)) does not allow us to conclude that Mary was at the wedding (\\( M \\)).\n\nAnswer: no",
