            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened' from 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and \\( B \\) is \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n\n3. The logical form \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is known as the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow B \\).\n\n4. In classical logic, a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
