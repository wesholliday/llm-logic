            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink' from 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked', we need to understand the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive in logic.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n   - The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). Instead, it is the inverse.\n   - The inverse of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the fribble was not snurgled, then the fribble did not crink' from 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked'.\n\nAnswer: no",
