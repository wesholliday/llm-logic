The original statement is: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the sneg was crampled\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between these statements.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n   - However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive; it is the inverse of the original statement.\n\n4. The inverse of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (i.e., \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)) is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink' from 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'.\n\nAnswer: no",
