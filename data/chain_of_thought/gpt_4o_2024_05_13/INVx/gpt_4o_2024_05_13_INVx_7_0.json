            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink' from 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow T \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the whiffle was shanked\" and \\( T \\) represents \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the whiffle was not shanked\" and \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"the whiffle did not tink.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow T \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between these statements.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) is \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\). This means \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n   - The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow T \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement.\n   - The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) (If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink) from \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) (If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked).\n\nAnswer: no",
