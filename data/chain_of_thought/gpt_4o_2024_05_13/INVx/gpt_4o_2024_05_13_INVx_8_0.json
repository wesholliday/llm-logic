            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled' from 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled', we need to understand the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is 'If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled'. This can be written in logical terms as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is 'the sprocket was cranked' and \\( Q \\) is 'the sprocket was daggled'.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled'. This can be written in logical terms as:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically equivalent to \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\); it is the inverse.\n\n5. The inverse of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
