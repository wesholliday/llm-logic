The original statement is: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( F \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( F \\) represents \"the zinger was fraggled\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the zinger was smoogled\".\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) can be inferred from \\( F \\rightarrow S \\), we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive in logic.\n   - The contrapositive of a statement \\( F \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\).\n   - The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( F \\rightarrow S \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement.\n   - The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) directly from \\( F \\rightarrow S \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
