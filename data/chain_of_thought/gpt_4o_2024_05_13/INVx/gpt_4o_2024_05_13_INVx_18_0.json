The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   - P \u2192 Q\n   - Where P is \"the shank was plooked\" and Q is \"the shank was nugged.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\" In logical terms, this can be written as:\n   - \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n   - Where \u00acP is \"the shank was not plooked\" and \u00acQ is \"the shank was not nugged.\"\n\n3. To determine if \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ can be inferred from P \u2192 Q, we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP. A conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other is also true.\n\n4. However, \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is not the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q. Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ directly from P \u2192 Q.\n\nAnswer: no",
