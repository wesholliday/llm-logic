The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the twonk was plinked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the twonk was varnished.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the twonk was not plinked\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the twonk was not varnished.\"\n\n3. The logical relationship between \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished' from 'If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.'\n\nAnswer: no",
