            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged' from 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged', we need to understand the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the smonk plagged.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The logical form \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is known as the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n4. In classical logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
