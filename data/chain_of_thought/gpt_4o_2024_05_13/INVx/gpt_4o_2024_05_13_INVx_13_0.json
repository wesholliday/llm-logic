The original statement is: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow T \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the glip was slogged\" and \\( T \\) represents \"the glip was tragged.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow T \\), we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive in logic.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) is \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n   - The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow T \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement.\n   - The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) directly from \\( S \\rightarrow T \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
