The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   - P: The grommet was sploffed.\n   - Q: The grommet plopped the frink.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If not P, then not Q\" where:\n   - not P: The grommet was not sploffed.\n   - not Q: The grommet did not plop the frink.\n\n3. The logical form of the original statement is: P \u2192 Q.\n\n4. The statement we want to infer is the contrapositive of the original statement: \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ.\n\n5. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then its contrapositive is also true.\n\nTherefore, if 'If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink' is true, we can infer 'If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
