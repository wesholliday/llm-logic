            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank' from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( M \\) represents \"the splat was morphed\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the splat quanked.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) can be inferred from \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive in logic.\n   - The contrapositive of a statement \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n   - The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is also true.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement.\n   - The inverse of a statement \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n   - The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we cannot infer 'If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank' from 'If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked'.\n\nAnswer: no",
