The given statement is: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"the smip was shripped\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"the smip lupped the zoint\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the smip was not shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive in logic.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n   - The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. However, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). Instead, it is the inverse.\n   - The inverse of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is not necessarily logically equivalent to \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
