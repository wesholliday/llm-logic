The original statement is 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'. This can be written in logical terms as:\n   - P \u2192 Q\n   - Where P is 'the clug was fleeked' and Q is 'the clug snugged'.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged'. This can be written in logical terms as:\n   - \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n\n3. To determine if \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ can be inferred from P \u2192 Q, we need to understand the concept of the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a statement P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. However, \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ is not the contrapositive of P \u2192 Q. Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ (If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged) from P \u2192 Q (If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged).\n\nAnswer: no",
