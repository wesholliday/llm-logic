Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\n2. The sunglasses might not be perched on her head.\n\nLet's analyze these statements step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a logical \"either-or\" statement. It means that there are two possibilities: \n   - The sunglasses are in her bag.\n   - The sunglasses are perched on her head.\n\n2. The second statement introduces uncertainty about one of the possibilities mentioned in the first statement. It says that the sunglasses might not be perched on her head. This implies that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not on her head.\n\nGiven these two statements, let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the sunglasses are not perched on her head (as suggested by the second statement), then according to the first statement, the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that if the sunglasses are not on her head, they must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
