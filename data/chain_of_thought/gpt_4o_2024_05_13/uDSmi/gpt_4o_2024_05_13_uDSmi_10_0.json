This means that it is possible that the sock is not under the bed. If the sock is not under the bed, then according to statement 1, the only remaining possibility is that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, if the sock is not under the bed, it must be in the laundry basket. Since statement 2 allows for the possibility that the sock is not under the bed, we can infer that the sock must be in the laundry basket if it is not under the bed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
