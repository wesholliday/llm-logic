This means that it is possible that the remote control is not under the couch.\n\nIf the remote control is not under the couch, then according to statement 1, the only remaining possibility is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, given that the remote control might not be under the couch, we can infer that it must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
