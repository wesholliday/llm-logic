This means that the scenario where the scarf is not on the coat rack is a valid possibility.\n\nGiven the first statement, if the scarf is not on the coat rack, then it must be in the backpack. Since the second statement allows for the possibility that the scarf is not on the coat rack, we can conclude that in that case, the scarf must be in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
