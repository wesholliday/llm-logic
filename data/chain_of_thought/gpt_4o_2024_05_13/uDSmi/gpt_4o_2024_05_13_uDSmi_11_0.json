This means that it is possible for the newspaper to not be on the porch.\n\nGiven these two statements together:\n- If the newspaper is not on the porch (as suggested by statement 2), then according to statement 1, the only remaining possibility is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
