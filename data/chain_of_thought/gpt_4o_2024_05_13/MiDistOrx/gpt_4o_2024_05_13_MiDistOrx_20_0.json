            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The froodle might be flump or fribble\" suggests that there are two possibilities for what the froodle could be: either flump or fribble. This implies that the froodle could be one or the other, but not necessarily both at the same time. The rephrased statement \"The froodle might be flump or it might be fribble\" essentially breaks down the original statement into two separate possibilities, maintaining the same meaning. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
