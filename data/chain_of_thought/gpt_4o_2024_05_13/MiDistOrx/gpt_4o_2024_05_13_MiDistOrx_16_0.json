The rephrased statement, 'The snorkel might be flibbit wibble or it might be flump wibble,' essentially breaks down the original statement into two separate possibilities, explicitly stating that the snorkel might be one or the other. Both statements convey the same meaning: there are two potential descriptions for the snorkel. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
