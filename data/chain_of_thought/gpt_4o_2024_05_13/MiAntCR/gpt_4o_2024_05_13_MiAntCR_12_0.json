The original statement is 'The project might be under budget'. This indicates a possibility regarding the financial aspect of the project.\n2. The inferred statement is 'The project might be completed by Friday and be under budget'. This statement combines two conditions: the project being under budget and the project being completed by Friday.\n\nThe original statement only addresses the budget aspect and does not provide any information about the timeline or completion date of the project. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the project's completion date from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
