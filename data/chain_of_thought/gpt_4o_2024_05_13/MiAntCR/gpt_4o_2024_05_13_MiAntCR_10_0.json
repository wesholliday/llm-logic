            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document might be signed and notarized' from 'The document might be notarized', we need to consider the relationship between notarization and signing. Notarization typically involves a notary public verifying the identity of the signer and witnessing the signing of the document. Therefore, for a document to be notarized, it generally must be signed. \n\nHowever, the original statement only says 'The document might be notarized', which implies the possibility of notarization but does not explicitly confirm that the document is signed. It leaves open the possibility that the document is not yet signed but could be signed and notarized in the future.\n\nGiven this, while notarization implies signing, the statement 'The document might be notarized' does not provide enough information to definitively infer that the document is both signed and notarized at this moment. It only suggests the potential for notarization, which includes signing as part of the process.\n\nAnswer: no",
