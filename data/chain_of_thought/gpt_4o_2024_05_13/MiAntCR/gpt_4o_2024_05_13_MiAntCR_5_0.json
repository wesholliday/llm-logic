However, it does not provide any information about the timing of the delivery. The phrase \"might be delivered today and signed for\" introduces a specific time frame (today) that is not mentioned in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the specific timing of the delivery from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
