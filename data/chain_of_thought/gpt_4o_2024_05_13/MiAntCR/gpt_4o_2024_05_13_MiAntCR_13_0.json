However, it does not provide any information about the language of the movie. Subtitles can be present in movies of any language, including English. Therefore, while it is possible that the movie is in English and has subtitles, the original statement does not provide enough information to definitively infer that the movie is in English. It only suggests the possibility of subtitles without specifying the language of the movie.\n\nAnswer: no",
