The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). \n\n- The contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is logically equivalent to the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
