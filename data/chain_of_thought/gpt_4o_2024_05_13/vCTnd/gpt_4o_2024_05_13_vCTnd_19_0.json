The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n- The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( \\neg (\\neg Q) \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which simplifies to \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nNotice that the contrapositive \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is exactly the same as the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
