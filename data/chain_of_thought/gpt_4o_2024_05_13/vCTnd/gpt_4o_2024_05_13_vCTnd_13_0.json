One way to do this is to use the contrapositive of the premise.\n\n- The contrapositive of \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg E \\).\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the contrapositive of the premise \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg E \\), which is exactly the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
