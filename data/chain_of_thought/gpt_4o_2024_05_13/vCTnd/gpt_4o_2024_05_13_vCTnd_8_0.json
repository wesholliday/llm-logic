            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise:** If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)\n     - Where \\( A \\) represents \"the issue was addressed\"\n     - \\( \\neg E \\) represents \"it was not addressed effectively\"\n\n2. **Conclusion:** If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n     - Where \\( E \\) represents \"the issue was addressed effectively\"\n     - \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"it was not addressed\"\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n3. **Contrapositive of the Premise:**\n   - The contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg E \\) is \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n   - This is because the contrapositive of an implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n4. **Comparison:**\n   - The contrapositive of the premise \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg E \\) is \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n   - The conclusion is \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n\nSince the conclusion \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is exactly the contrapositive of the premise \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg E \\), and a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
