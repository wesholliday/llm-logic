One way to do this is to use the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n- The contrapositive of the premise \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) is \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of the premise \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) is exactly the conclusion \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
