            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If the job was completed, then it was not completed well.\n   - Symbolically: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the job was completed\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the job was completed well\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\n   - Symbolically: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nLet's find the contrapositive of the premise:\n- Premise: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n- Contrapositive: \\( \\neg (\\neg Q) \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n- Simplifying: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\nWe see that the contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is exactly the conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
