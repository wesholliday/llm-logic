            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"I went to the store\" and \\( Q \\) is \"I bought vegetables.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n- The contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nSince the conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is exactly the contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), and a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
