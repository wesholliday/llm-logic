One way to do this is to use the contrapositive.\n\n- The contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nSince the conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is exactly the contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
