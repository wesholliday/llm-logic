            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise:** If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\n   - Symbolically: \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\)\n   - Where \\( R \\) represents \"It's raining\" and \\( H \\) represents \"It's raining hard\".\n\n2. **Conclusion:** If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\n   - Symbolically: \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to use the contrapositive, which states that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically equivalent to \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nLet's find the contrapositive of the premise:\n- Premise: \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\)\n- Contrapositive: \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\)\n\nThe contrapositive of the premise \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\) is \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\), which is exactly the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and contrapositives are logically equivalent to their original statements, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
