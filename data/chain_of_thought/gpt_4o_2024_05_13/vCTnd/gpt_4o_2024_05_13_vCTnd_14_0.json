One way to do this is to use the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n- The contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is exactly the conclusion \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
