            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\n   - Symbolically: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the customer was served\" and \\( P \\) represents \"the customer was served promptly\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\n   - Symbolically: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to use the contrapositive, which states that \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is logically equivalent to \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\n- The contrapositive of the premise \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is \\( \\neg (\\neg P) \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), which simplifies to \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of the premise \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is exactly the conclusion \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and contrapositives are logically equivalent to their original statements, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
