            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise:** If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"instructions were given\" and \\( Q \\) is \"instructions were explained clearly\".\n\n2. **Conclusion:** If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n- The contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of the premise is exactly the conclusion. Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, the conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must be true if the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
