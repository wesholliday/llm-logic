            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly.\n   - Symbolically: \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( W \\) represents \"the clothes were washed\" and \\( P \\) represents \"the clothes were washed properly\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\n   - Symbolically: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg W \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to use the contrapositive of the premise.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nLet's find the contrapositive of the premise:\n- Original premise: \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n- Contrapositive: \\( \\neg (\\neg P) \\rightarrow \\neg W \\)\n- Simplifying: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg W \\)\n\nWe see that the contrapositive of the premise \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg W \\), which is exactly the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
