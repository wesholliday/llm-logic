The premise is: \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n     where \\( E \\) represents \"Ann exercised\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Ann exercised strenuously.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nLet's find the contrapositive of the premise:\n- The premise is \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n- The contrapositive of \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)\n\nNotice that the contrapositive of the premise \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\) is exactly the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
