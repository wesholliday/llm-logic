            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise:** If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly.\n   - Symbolically: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the customer was greeted\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the customer was greeted warmly\".\n\n2. **Conclusion:** If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted.\n   - Symbolically: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nLet's find the contrapositive of the premise:\n- Premise: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n- Contrapositive: \\( \\neg (\\neg Q) \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n- Simplifying: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\nWe see that the contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is exactly the conclusion.\n\nSince the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
