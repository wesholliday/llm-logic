The original statement is 'The grazzle must flump a bimboozle quazzle'.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The grazzle must glorp a zibble snizzle and flump a bimboozle quazzle'.\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the grazzle flumping a bimboozle quazzle. It does not mention anything about glorp or a zibble snizzle. \n\nTo infer the second statement, we would need additional information that connects the grazzle to glorp a zibble snizzle. Since the original statement does not provide this information, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
