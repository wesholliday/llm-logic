The original statement is 'The glorp must be flump'. This means that being flump is a necessary condition for the glorp.\n2. The inferred statement is 'The glorp must be snizzle and be flump'. This implies two conditions: the glorp must be snizzle and the glorp must be flump.\n\nFor the inference to be valid, the original statement must imply both conditions in the inferred statement. However, the original statement only specifies that the glorp must be flump and does not mention anything about being snizzle. Therefore, we cannot infer the additional condition of being snizzle from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
