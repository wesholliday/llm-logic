The original statement is 'The zump must be shimble'. This means that being shimble is a necessary condition for the zump.\n2. The inferred statement is 'The zump must be zazzle and be shimble'. This statement introduces an additional condition, zazzle, which is not mentioned in the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement only specifies that the zump must be shimble and does not mention anything about being zazzle, we cannot logically infer that the zump must also be zazzle. The additional condition (zazzle) is not supported by the original information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
