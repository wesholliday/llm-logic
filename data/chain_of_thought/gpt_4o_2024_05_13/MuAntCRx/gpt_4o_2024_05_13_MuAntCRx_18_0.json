The original statement is 'The wobble must be quork fizzle frozz'.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The wobble must be glorp quank quork and be quork fizzle frozz'.\n\nThe original statement asserts that 'The wobble must be quork fizzle frozz'. It does not provide any information about 'glorp quank quork'. \n\nThe inferred statement adds new information ('glorp quank quork') that is not present in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the additional information ('glorp quank quork') from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
