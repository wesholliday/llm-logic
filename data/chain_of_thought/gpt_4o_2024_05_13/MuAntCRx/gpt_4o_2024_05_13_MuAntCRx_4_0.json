The original statement is 'The glorp must be in the flibbit blimp'.\n2. The inferred statement is 'The glorp must be in the plonk wump and be in the flibbit blimp'.\n\nThe original statement only specifies that the glorp must be in the flibbit blimp. It does not provide any information about the glorp being in the plonk wump. The inferred statement adds an additional condition (being in the plonk wump) that is not present in the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement does not mention anything about the plonk wump, we cannot logically infer that the glorp must be in both the plonk wump and the flibbit blimp based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
