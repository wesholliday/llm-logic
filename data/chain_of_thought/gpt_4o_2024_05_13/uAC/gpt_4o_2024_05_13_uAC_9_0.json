The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written as:\n   - If L, then M (where L represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and M represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written as:\n   - M is true.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer L (Lisa bought the red shirt) from the given information.\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \"If L, then M\" does not imply that L is true just because M is true. The truth of M does not provide any information about the truth of L. The only thing the conditional statement tells us is that if L were true, then M would also be true. However, M being true on its own does not necessarily mean that L is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
