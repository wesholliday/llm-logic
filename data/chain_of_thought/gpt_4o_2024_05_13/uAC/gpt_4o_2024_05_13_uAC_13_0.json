However, it does not tell us what happens if the truck is blue. The truck being blue could be true regardless of the color of the car. \n\nTo infer that the car was red, we would need the converse of the original conditional statement, which would be: \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red.\" However, we do not have this information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that the car was red just because the truck was blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
