However, it does not state that if \\( L \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must be true. The truth of \\( L \\) alone does not provide information about the truth of \\( J \\).\n\nTherefore, knowing that Lucy went to the zoo (\\( L \\)) does not allow us to conclude that Joe went to the park (\\( J \\)).\n\nAnswer: no",
