However, the converse is not necessarily true. Just because \\( M \\) is true, it does not mean that \\( J \\) must be true. There could be other authors who write mystery novels, and the book being a mystery novel does not exclusively imply that it was written by James.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: no",
