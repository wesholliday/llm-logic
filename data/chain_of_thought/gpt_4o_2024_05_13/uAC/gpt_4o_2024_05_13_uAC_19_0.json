The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( J \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( T \\) (Tom watched football) can be inferred from the given information.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) tells us that if \\( T \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must also be true.\n- The statement \\( J \\) tells us that Jen watched basketball, so \\( J \\) is true.\n\nHowever, knowing that \\( J \\) is true does not provide any information about whether \\( T \\) is true or false. The conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) does not imply that \\( T \\) must be true if \\( J \\) is true. It only tells us what happens if \\( T \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer from the given information that Tom watched football.\n\nAnswer: no",
