The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written as: \n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( M \\) (Mary was at the wedding) can be inferred from the given information.\n\nFrom the conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. However, the fact that Sue was at the wedding (\\( S \\)) does not necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding. The conditional statement does not provide information about what happens if Sue was at the wedding without knowing whether Mary was there or not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
