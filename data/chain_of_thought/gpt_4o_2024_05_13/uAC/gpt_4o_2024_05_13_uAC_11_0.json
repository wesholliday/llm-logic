However, knowing that \\( B \\) is true does not necessarily mean that \\( C \\) is true. \\( B \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( C \\).\n\nFor example, the muffins could be blueberry regardless of whether the cake was chocolate or not. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the cake is chocolate, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the cake was chocolate just because the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: no",
