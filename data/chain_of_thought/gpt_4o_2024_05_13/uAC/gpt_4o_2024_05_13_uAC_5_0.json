The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball) can be inferred from these statements.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) tells us that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must be true.\n- The statement \\( A \\) tells us that \\( A \\) is true.\n\nHowever, knowing that \\( A \\) is true does not provide any information about \\( J \\). The truth of \\( A \\) does not imply the truth of \\( J \\); it only confirms that if \\( J \\) were true, \\( A \\) would also be true. But since \\( A \\) is true regardless, we cannot conclude anything about \\( J \\) based solely on these statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
