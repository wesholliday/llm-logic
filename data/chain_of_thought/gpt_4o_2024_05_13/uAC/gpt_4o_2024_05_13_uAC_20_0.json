However, knowing that \\( B \\) is true does not necessarily mean that \\( A \\) is true. \\( B \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( A \\).\n\nFor example:\n- If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (Given)\n- The banana was yellow. (Given)\n- This does not provide information about whether the apple was red or not. The banana being yellow could be true regardless of the apple's color.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the apple was red based solely on the information that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: no",
