The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical terms as:\n   - If P (Sue chose pizza), then Q (Bob chose pasta).\n\n2. The second statement is a factual statement: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical terms as:\n   - Q (Bob chose pasta).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer P (Sue chose pizza) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not imply that Q being true means P must be true. It only states that if P is true, then Q will definitely be true. However, Q being true does not necessarily mean that P is true. There could be other reasons for Q being true that are not related to P.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements:\n- \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" (If P, then Q)\n- \"Bob chose pasta\" (Q)\n\nWe cannot definitively infer that Sue chose pizza (P).\n\nAnswer: no",
