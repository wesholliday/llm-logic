The conditional statement \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) does not provide information about what happens if \\( C \\) is true independently of \\( D \\). \\( C \\) being true could be the result of other conditions not specified in the problem.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \\( D \\) (the dog was inside) based solely on the information provided.\n\nAnswer: no",
