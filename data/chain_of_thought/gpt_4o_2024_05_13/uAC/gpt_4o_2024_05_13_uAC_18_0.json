However, knowing that \\( Q \\) is true (the truck was metal) does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true. \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\) being true.\n\nFor example, the truck being metal could be true regardless of whether the doll was plastic or not. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the doll is plastic, not what happens if the truck is metal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the doll was plastic just because the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: no",
