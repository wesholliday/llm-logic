However, knowing that \\( T \\) is true (Erin took a train) does not necessarily mean that \\( S \\) is true. \\( T \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( S \\).\n\nFor example, Erin could have taken a train regardless of whether Sam took a plane or not. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Sam took a plane, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that Sam took a plane just because Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: no",
