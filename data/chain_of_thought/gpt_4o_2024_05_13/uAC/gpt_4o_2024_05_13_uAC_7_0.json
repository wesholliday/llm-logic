The conditional statement only tells us what happens if \\( A \\) is true, but it does not tell us what happens if \\( C \\) is true. In other words, \\( C \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( A \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that Alex finished the race based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
