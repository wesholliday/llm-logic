The truth table for a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is as follows:\n\n| \\( A \\) | \\( C \\) | \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     |\n| T      | F      | F                     |\n| F      | T      | T                     |\n| F      | F      | T                     |\n\nFrom the table, we see that when \\( A \\) is false (\\( \\neg A \\)), the conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is true regardless of the truth value of \\( C \\). This means that \\( C \\) can be either true or false when \\( \\neg A \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information that Alex did not finish the race (\\( \\neg A \\)), we cannot infer whether Chris finished the race or not. Chris finishing the race (\\( C \\)) or not finishing the race (\\( \\neg C \\)) are both possible scenarios.\n\nAnswer: no",
