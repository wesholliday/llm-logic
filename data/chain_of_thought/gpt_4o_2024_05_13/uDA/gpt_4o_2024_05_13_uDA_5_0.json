The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball), then \\( A \\) (Amy played tennis).\n   - Symbolically: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - Not \\( J \\).\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg A \\) (Amy did not play tennis) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) does not provide any information about what happens if \\( J \\) is false. The only thing it tells us is that if \\( J \\) were true, then \\( A \\) would have to be true. However, since \\( J \\) is false (\\( \\neg J \\)), the conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) does not apply, and we cannot make any conclusions about \\( A \\) based solely on \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg A \\) from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
