The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg W \\) (the wolf was not in the den) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) is \\( \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, we are given \\( \\neg B \\) (the bear was not in the cave), and we need to determine if \\( \\neg W \\) follows from this.\n\nFrom the conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow W \\), if \\( B \\) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), the conditional statement does not provide any information about \\( W \\). The conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) only tells us what happens if \\( B \\) is true. If \\( B \\) is false, \\( W \\) can be either true or false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg W \\) (the wolf was not in the den) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
