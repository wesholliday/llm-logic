The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow R \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( R \\) represents \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The alien did not visit Mars.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nWe need to determine whether \\( \\neg R \\) (the robot did not visit Jupiter) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) is \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, we are given \\( \\neg A \\), not \\( \\neg R \\).\n\nGiven \\( \\neg A \\), we cannot directly infer \\( \\neg R \\) from the conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow R \\). The conditional statement only tells us what happens if \\( A \\) is true, not what happens if \\( A \\) is false. Therefore, \\( \\neg A \\) does not provide enough information to conclude \\( \\neg R \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
