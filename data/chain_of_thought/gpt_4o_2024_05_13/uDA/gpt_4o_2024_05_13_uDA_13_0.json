The only thing we know from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would have to be true. However, if \\( P \\) is false, \\( Q \\) can be either true or false.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\text{Car is red} \\rightarrow \\text{Truck is blue} \\)\n- \\( \\neg (\\text{Car is red}) \\)\n\nFrom these, we cannot infer \\( \\neg (\\text{Truck is blue}) \\) because the conditional statement does not specify what happens when the car is not red. The truck could still be blue or not blue independently of the car's color.\n\nAnswer: no",
