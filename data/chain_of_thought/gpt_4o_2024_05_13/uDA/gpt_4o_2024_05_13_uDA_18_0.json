The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - \\( P \\): The doll was plastic.\n     - \\( Q \\): The truck was metal.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg Q \\) (the truck was not metal) can be inferred from \\( \\neg P \\) (the doll was not plastic).\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide any information about \\( Q \\) when \\( P \\) is false. The truth of \\( Q \\) is independent of \\( P \\) being false. Therefore, from \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot infer \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nTo summarize:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- \\( \\neg P \\) tells us that \\( P \\) is false.\n- From \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot conclude anything about \\( Q \\).\n\nThus, we cannot infer that the truck was not metal based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
