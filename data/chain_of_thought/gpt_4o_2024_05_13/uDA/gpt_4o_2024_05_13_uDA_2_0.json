The only thing it tells us is that if \\( G \\) were true, then \\( U \\) would have to be true. However, since \\( G \\) is false (\\( \\neg G \\)), the conditional statement \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) does not impose any constraints on \\( U \\). Therefore, \\( U \\) could be either true or false.\n\nGiven that \\( G \\) is false, we cannot definitively conclude the truth value of \\( U \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
