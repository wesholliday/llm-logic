The conditional statement only tells us what happens if \\( D \\) is true. When \\( D \\) is false, the conditional statement \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) does not impose any constraints on \\( C \\).\n\nTherefore, from \\( \\neg D \\) alone, we cannot infer \\( \\neg C \\). The cat could be outside or not outside; the given information does not allow us to make a definitive conclusion about the cat's position.\n\nAnswer: no",
