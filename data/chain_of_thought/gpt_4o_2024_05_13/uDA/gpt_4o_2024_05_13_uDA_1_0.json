The only thing it tells us is that if \\( M \\) were true, then \\( S \\) would also be true. However, since \\( M \\) is false (\\( \\neg M \\)), the conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) does not apply, and we cannot infer anything about \\( S \\) based solely on \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that Sue was not at the wedding just because Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
