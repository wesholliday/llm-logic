The truth table for \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) is as follows:\n\n| \\( V \\) | \\( M \\) | \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     |\n| T      | F      | F                     |\n| F      | T      | T                     |\n| F      | F      | T                     |\n\nFrom the truth table, we see that when \\( V \\) is false (\\( \\neg V \\)), the conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) is true regardless of whether \\( M \\) is true or false. This means that \\( \\neg V \\) does not provide any information about \\( M \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given information that the vampire was not awake (\\( \\neg V \\)), we cannot infer whether the mummy was awake or not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
