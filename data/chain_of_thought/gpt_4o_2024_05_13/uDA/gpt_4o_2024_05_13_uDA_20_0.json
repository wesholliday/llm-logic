The truth table for \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is as follows:\n\n| \\( A \\) | \\( B \\) | \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     |\n| T      | F      | F                     |\n| F      | T      | T                     |\n| F      | F      | T                     |\n\nFrom the table, we see that when \\( A \\) is false (\\( \\neg A \\)), \\( B \\) can be either true or false. Therefore, knowing that the apple was not red (\\( \\neg A \\)) does not allow us to infer anything about the color of the banana (\\( B \\)).\n\nAnswer: no",
