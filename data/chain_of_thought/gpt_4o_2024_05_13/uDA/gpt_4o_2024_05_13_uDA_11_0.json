The truth of \\( M \\) is not determined by the falsity of \\( C \\). The conditional statement only tells us what happens if \\( C \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from \\( \\neg C \\), we cannot infer \\( \\neg M \\). The muffins could still be blueberry or not; the given information does not allow us to conclude either way.\n\nAnswer: no",
