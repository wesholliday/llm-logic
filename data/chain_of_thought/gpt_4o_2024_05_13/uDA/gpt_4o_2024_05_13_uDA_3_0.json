The conditional statement only tells us what happens if \\( J \\) is true. Therefore, knowing that \\( J \\) is false (\\( \\neg J \\)) does not allow us to make any definitive conclusions about \\( M \\).\n\nThus, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
