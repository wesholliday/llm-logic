The truth table for \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is as follows:\n\n| \\( P \\) | \\( Q \\) | \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) |\n|--------|---------|-----------------------|\n| T      | T       | T                     |\n| T      | F       | F                     |\n| F      | T       | T                     |\n| F      | F       | T                     |\n\nFrom the table, we see that when \\( P \\) is false (\\( \\neg P \\)), the implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is always true regardless of the truth value of \\( Q \\). Therefore, knowing \\( \\neg P \\) (Sam did not take a plane) does not provide any information about \\( Q \\) (whether Erin took a train or not).\n\nThus, we cannot infer \\( \\neg Q \\) (Erin did not take a train) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
