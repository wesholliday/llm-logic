            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo, let's analyze the given statements step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Joe did not go to the park.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg P \\) (Joe did not go to the park) allows us to infer \\( \\neg Z \\) (Lucy did not go to the zoo).\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) does not provide any information about what happens if \\( P \\) is false. The only thing it tells us is that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Z \\) would also be true. However, if \\( P \\) is false, \\( Z \\) could be either true or false. Therefore, from \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot infer \\( \\neg Z \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
