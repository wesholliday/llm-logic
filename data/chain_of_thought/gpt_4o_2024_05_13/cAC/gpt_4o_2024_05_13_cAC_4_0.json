The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow R \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"The alien visited Mars\" and \\( R \\) represents \"The robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( R \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can conclude \\( A \\) (The alien visited Mars) from the given statements \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and \\( R \\).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) means that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( R \\) must also be true. However, it does not imply that if \\( R \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must be true. The truth of \\( R \\) alone does not provide any information about the truth of \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" and \"The robot visited Jupiter,\" we cannot conclude that \"The alien visited Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
