The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"The apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( B \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can conclude \\( A \\) (\"The apple was red\") from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) means that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must also be true. However, knowing that \\( B \\) is true does not necessarily mean that \\( A \\) is true. \\( B \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( A \\) being true.\n\nFor example, the banana could be yellow regardless of the color of the apple. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the apple is red, not what happens if the banana is yellow.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow,\" we cannot logically conclude that \"The apple was red.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
