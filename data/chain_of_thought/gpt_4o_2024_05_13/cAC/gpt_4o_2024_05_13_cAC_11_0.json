The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) represents \"The cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( M \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can conclude \\( C \\) (The cake was chocolate) from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\).\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) means that if \\( C \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true. However, knowing that \\( M \\) is true does not necessarily mean that \\( C \\) is true. \\( M \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( C \\) being true.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Suppose the cake was vanilla (not chocolate), and the muffins were still blueberry. This scenario does not violate the given statements because the conditional \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) does not require \\( C \\) to be true for \\( M \\) to be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot definitively conclude that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
