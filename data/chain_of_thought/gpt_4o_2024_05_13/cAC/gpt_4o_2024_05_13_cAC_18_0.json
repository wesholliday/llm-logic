The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The doll was plastic) necessarily follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal) and \\( Q \\) (The truck was metal).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot conclude \\( P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The truth of \\( Q \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\). There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that are not related to \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
