The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( C \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude \\( A \\) (Alex finished the race) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) does not provide information about the truth of \\( A \\) if \\( C \\) is true. It only tells us that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be true. However, knowing \\( C \\) is true does not necessarily mean \\( A \\) is true. \\( C \\) could be true regardless of \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and \"Chris finished the race,\" we cannot conclude that \"Alex finished the race.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
