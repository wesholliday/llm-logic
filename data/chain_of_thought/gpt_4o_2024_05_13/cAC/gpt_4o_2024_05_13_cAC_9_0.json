The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can conclude \\( L \\) (Lisa bought the red shirt) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) means that if \\( L \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true. However, it does not imply that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( L \\) must be true. The truth of \\( M \\) alone does not provide information about the truth of \\( L \\).\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Suppose \\( L \\) is false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt). The conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) would still hold true as long as \\( M \\) is true (Mark bought the blue shirt), which is given in the second statement.\n\nTherefore, knowing that \\( M \\) is true does not allow us to conclude that \\( L \\) is true. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if \\( L \\) is true, not the other way around.\n\nAnswer: no",
