The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( V \\) represents \"The vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude \\( V \\) (The vampire was awake) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) means that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide information about what happens if \\( M \\) is true. Specifically, \\( M \\) being true does not necessarily imply that \\( V \\) is true. \n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Suppose \\( V \\) is false (the vampire was not awake). According to the conditional statement, if \\( V \\) is false, the conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) is still true regardless of the truth value of \\( M \\). Therefore, \\( M \\) can be true or false independently of \\( V \\).\n\nGiven that \\( M \\) is true (the mummy was awake), we cannot conclude that \\( V \\) must be true (the vampire was awake) because the conditional statement does not provide information about the truth value of \\( V \\) when \\( M \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude \"The vampire was awake\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
