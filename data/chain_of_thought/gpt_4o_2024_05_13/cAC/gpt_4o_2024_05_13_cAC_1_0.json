The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( S \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can conclude \\( M \\) (Mary was at the wedding) from these two statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) means that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( M \\) if \\( S \\) is true. The truth of \\( S \\) alone does not imply the truth of \\( M \\).\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Suppose \\( M \\) is false (Mary was not at the wedding). The conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) would still hold true as long as \\( S \\) is true (Sue was at the wedding), because a false antecedent (Mary was not at the wedding) makes the conditional statement true regardless of the consequent.\n\nTherefore, knowing that \\( S \\) is true (Sue was at the wedding) does not allow us to conclude that \\( M \\) is true (Mary was at the wedding).\n\nAnswer: no",
