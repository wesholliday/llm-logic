The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Z \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can conclude \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) means that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Z \\) must also be true. However, it does not imply that if \\( Z \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be true. The truth of \\( Z \\) alone does not provide any information about the truth of \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy went to the zoo,\" we cannot conclude that \"Joe went to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
