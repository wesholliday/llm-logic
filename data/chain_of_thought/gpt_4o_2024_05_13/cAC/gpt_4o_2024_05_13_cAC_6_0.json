The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can conclude \\( P \\) (i.e., \"Sue chose pizza\") from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot directly conclude \\( P \\). This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. The fact that \\( Q \\) is true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) must be true, because \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude \"Sue chose pizza\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
