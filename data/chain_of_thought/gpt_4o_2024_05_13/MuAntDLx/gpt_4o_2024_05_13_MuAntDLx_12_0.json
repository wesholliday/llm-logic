This can be simplified to 'The zizz must be quank by blimp' because the repetition of 'blimp' in the 'or' clause does not add any additional information or options. Essentially, the statement is saying that there is only one way for the zizz to be quank, which is by blimp.\n\nTherefore, the simplified form of the original statement is exactly 'The zizz must be quank by blimp'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
