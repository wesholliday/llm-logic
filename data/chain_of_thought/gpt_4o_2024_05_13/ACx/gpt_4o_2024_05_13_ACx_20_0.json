The first statement is: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"The fleeg was bluttered\" and \\( S \\) represents \"The fleeg surned.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fleeg surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (The fleeg was bluttered) from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we are given:\n- \\( B \\rightarrow S \\)\n- \\( S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( B \\) necessarily follows from these premises.\n\nIn logic, from \\( B \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( S \\), we cannot directly infer \\( B \\). This is because \\( S \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( B \\). The implication \\( B \\rightarrow S \\) only tells us that if \\( B \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must be true, but it does not tell us that \\( S \\) being true implies \\( B \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( B \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
