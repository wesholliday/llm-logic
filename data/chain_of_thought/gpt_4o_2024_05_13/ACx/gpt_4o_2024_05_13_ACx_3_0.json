The first statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( M \\) represents \"The splat was morphed\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"The splat quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The splat quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( M \\) (The splat was morphed) from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we are given:\n- \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to find out if \\( M \\) necessarily follows from these.\n\nThe logical rule that applies here is called \"modus ponens,\" which states that if \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( M \\) are both true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, we are not given \\( M \\); we are given \\( Q \\).\n\nThe situation we have is:\n- \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( Q \\)\n\nThis is a case of affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Just because \\( Q \\) is true, it does not necessarily mean that \\( M \\) is true. There could be other reasons for \\( Q \\) to be true that do not involve \\( M \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( M \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
