The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If B, then Z (B \u2192 Z)\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flugel was zargled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - Z\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer 'The flugel was blimmed' (B) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement (B \u2192 Z) and the affirmation of the consequent (Z), we cannot infer the antecedent (B). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because Z is true, it does not necessarily mean that B is true; there could be other reasons why Z is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flugel was blimmed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
