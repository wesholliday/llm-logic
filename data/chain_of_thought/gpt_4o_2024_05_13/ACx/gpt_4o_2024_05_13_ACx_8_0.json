The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( C \\rightarrow D \\)\n   where \\( C \\) represents \"The sprocket was cranked\" and \\( D \\) represents \"The sprocket was daggled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The sprocket was daggled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( D \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( C \\) (The sprocket was cranked) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) and \\( D \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) and \\( D \\), we cannot directly infer \\( C \\). This is because \\( D \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( C \\). The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( C \\) is true, then \\( D \\) must be true, but it does not tell us that \\( D \\) being true necessarily means \\( C \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The sprocket was cranked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
