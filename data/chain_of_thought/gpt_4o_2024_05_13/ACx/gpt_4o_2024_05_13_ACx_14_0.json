In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the clug was fleeked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the clug snugged.\"\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The clug snugged.\"\n   - This is a straightforward statement. In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( Q \\).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (\"The clug was fleeked\") from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot directly infer \\( P \\). This is because \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\). The truth of \\( Q \\) does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true; it only means that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would be true. \n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- If it rains (P), then the ground will be wet (Q).\n- The ground is wet (Q).\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that it rained (P) because the ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., someone watered the garden).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot infer that \"The clug was fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
