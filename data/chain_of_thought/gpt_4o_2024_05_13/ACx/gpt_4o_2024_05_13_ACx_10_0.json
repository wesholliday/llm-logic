The first statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow G \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"The wug was sproinged\" and \\( G \\) represents \"The wug was garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug was garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( G \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The wug was sproinged) from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we are given:\n- \\( S \\rightarrow G \\)\n- \\( G \\)\n\nWe need to check if \\( S \\) necessarily follows from these premises.\n\nIn logic, from \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) and \\( G \\), we cannot directly infer \\( S \\). This is because \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) only tells us that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( G \\) must be true. However, \\( G \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( S \\) is true; \\( G \\) could be true for other reasons not related to \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( S \\) from \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) and \\( G \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
