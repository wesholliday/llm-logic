The first statement is: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The flob was skizzled\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The flob movated.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flob movated.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The flob was skizzled) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot directly infer \\( P \\). This is a common logical fallacy known as affirming the consequent. Just because \\( Q \\) is true, it does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) must be true. There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The flob was skizzled' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
