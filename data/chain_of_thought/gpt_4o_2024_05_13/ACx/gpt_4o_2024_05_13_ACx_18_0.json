The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow N \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"The shank was plooked\" and \\( N \\) represents \"The shank was nugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The shank was nugged.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( N \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (The shank was plooked) from the given statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) and \\( N \\), we cannot directly infer \\( P \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( N \\) must be true. However, knowing that \\( N \\) is true does not provide information about whether \\( P \\) is true or false. \\( N \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The shank was plooked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
