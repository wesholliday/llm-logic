The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Where P is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and Q is \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fribble crinked.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - Q\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer P (\"the fribble was snurgled\") from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from P \u2192 Q and Q, we cannot directly infer P. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true; there could be other reasons why Q is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"the fribble was snurgled\" solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
