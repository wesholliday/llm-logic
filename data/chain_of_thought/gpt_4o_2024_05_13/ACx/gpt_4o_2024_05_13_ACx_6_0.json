The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The grommet was sploffed\" and \\( B \\) is \"The grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The grommet plopped the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( B \\) (The grommet plopped the frink) allows us to infer \\( A \\) (The grommet was sploffed).\n\nIn logic, from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\), we cannot infer \\( A \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The fact that \\( B \\) is true does not necessarily mean that \\( A \\) is true; there could be other reasons why \\( B \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The grommet was sploffed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
