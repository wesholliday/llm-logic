The first statement is: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow P \\)\n   - Where \\( V \\) represents \"The smonk was vreebled\" and \\( P \\) represents \"The smonk plagged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The smonk plagged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( V \\) (The smonk was vreebled) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we are given:\n- \\( V \\rightarrow P \\)\n- \\( P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( V \\) follows from these.\n\nIn logic, from \\( V \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( P \\), we cannot directly infer \\( V \\). This is because \\( P \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( V \\). The implication \\( V \\rightarrow P \\) only tells us that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be true, but it does not tell us that \\( V \\) is the only way for \\( P \\) to be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( V \\) from \\( V \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
