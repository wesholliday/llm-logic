The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Where P is \"The dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"The dreb was spened.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The dreb was spened.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - Q\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer P (\"The dreb was vroombed\") from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from P \u2192 Q and Q, we cannot directly infer P. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because Q is true, it does not necessarily mean that P is true. There could be other reasons why Q is true that do not involve P.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The dreb was vroombed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
