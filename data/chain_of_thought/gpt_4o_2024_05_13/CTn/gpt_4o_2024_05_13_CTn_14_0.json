The original statement is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg W \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( \\neg W \\) represents \"the wolf was not in the den.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf was in the den\" and \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nTo see if \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) implies \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg W) \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg W) \\) gives us \\( W \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly what we are trying to infer, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
