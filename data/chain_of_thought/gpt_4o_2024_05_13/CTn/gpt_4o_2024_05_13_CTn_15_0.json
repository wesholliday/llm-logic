The original statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( \\neg E \\) represents \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the statement \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" can be inferred.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( E \\) represents \"Erin took a train\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\n3. To see if \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\), we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\) is \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
