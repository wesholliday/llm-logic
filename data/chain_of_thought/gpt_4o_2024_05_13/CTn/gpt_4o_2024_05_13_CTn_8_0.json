The original statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   - This means: If \\( V \\) (the vampire is awake) is true, then \\( \\neg M \\) (the mummy is not awake) must be true.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n   - This means: If \\( M \\) (the mummy is awake) is true, then \\( \\neg V \\) (the vampire is not awake) must be true.\n\nTo see if \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) implies \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\), we can use the concept of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg M) \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg M) \\) gives \\( M \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) from \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
