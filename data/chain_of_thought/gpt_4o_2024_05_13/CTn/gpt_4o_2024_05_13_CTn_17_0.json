The original statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg K \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( \\neg K \\) represents \"Kate did not eat the salad.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( K \\) represents \"Kate ate the salad\" and \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nTo see if \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg K \\) implies \\( K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg K \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg K) \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg K) \\) gives \\( K \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly what we are trying to infer, and since a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can indeed infer \\( K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) from \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg K \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
