The original statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n     - Where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\"\n     - And \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the muffins were not blueberry\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n     - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry\"\n     - And \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the cake was not chocolate\"\n\n3. To check if \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), we need to understand the contrapositive of the original statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n     - This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) is \\( \\neg q \\rightarrow \\neg p \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n4. Therefore, the contrapositive of \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" is \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate' from 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
