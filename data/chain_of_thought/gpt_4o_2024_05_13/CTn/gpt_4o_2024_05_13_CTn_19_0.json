The original statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( \\neg J \\) represents \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n   - Where \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball\" and \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nTo see if \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) implies \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg J) \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg J) \\) gives \\( J \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly the statement we are trying to infer, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
