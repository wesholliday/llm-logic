The original statement is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\)\n   - Where \\( G \\) represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and \\( \\neg U \\) represents \"the unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\)\n   - Where \\( U \\) represents \"the unicorn was in the forest\" and \\( \\neg G \\) represents \"the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nTo see if \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\) implies \\( U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg U) \\rightarrow \\neg G \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg U) \\) gives us \\( U \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\) is \\( U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\), and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\) from \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
