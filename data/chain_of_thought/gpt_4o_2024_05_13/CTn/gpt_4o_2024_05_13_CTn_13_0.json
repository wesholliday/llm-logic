The original statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) represents \"the car was red\" and \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"the truck was not blue.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents \"the truck was blue\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the car was not red.\"\n\n3. To see if \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) implies \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), we can use the contrapositive.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is the contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\), and the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true, we can indeed infer \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) from \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
