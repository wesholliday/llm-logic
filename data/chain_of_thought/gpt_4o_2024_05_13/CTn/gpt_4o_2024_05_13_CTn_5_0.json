The original statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n   - Where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis\" and \\( \\neg J \\) represents \"Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nTo see if \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) implies \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg A) \\rightarrow \\neg J \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg A) \\) gives us \\( A \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly what we are trying to infer, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
