The original statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the pants were not denim.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n     where \\( P \\) represents \"the pants were denim\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\n3. The logical form \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of this statement is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. The statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is indeed the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
