The original statement is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( \\neg B \\) is \"the robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n     where \\( B \\) is \"the robot visited Jupiter\" and \\( \\neg A \\) is \"the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\n3. The logical form \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is indeed \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars' from 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
