The original statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg L \\)\n   - Where \\( J \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( \\neg L \\) represents \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the statement \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" can be inferred.\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\)\n   - Where \\( L \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\" and \\( \\neg J \\) represents \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\n3. To see if \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) can be inferred from \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg L \\), we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) is \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\).\n   - In logic, a statement is always equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nSince \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is the contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg L \\), and a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can indeed infer \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) from \\( J \\rightarrow \\neg L \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
