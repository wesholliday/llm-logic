The original statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"the apple was red\" and \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the banana was not yellow.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the banana was yellow\" and \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"the apple was not red.\"\n\n3. To check if \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), we need to understand the contrapositive of the original statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n   - In logic, a statement is always equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\n4. Therefore, \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is logically equivalent to \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly what we are trying to infer, we can indeed infer 'If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
