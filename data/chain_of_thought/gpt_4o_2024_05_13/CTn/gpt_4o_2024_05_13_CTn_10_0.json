The original statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   - Where \\( D \\) represents \"the dog was inside\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the cat was not outside.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) represents \"the cat was outside\" and \\( \\neg D \\) represents \"the dog was not inside.\"\n\nTo see if \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) implies \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg C) \\rightarrow \\neg D \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg C) \\) gives \\( C \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly what we are trying to infer, and since a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can indeed infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
