The original statement is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\n3. The logical form \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of this statement is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. The statement \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is indeed the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
