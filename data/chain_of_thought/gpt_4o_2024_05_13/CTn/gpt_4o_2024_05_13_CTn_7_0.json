The original statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the statement \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race\" can be inferred.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race\" and \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\n3. To see if \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n   - In logic, a statement is always equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nSince \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), and a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can indeed infer \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) from \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
