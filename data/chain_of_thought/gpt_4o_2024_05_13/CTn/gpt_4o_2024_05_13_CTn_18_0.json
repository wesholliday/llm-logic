The original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n     where \\( P \\) represents \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"the truck was not metal.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     where \\( M \\) represents \"the truck was metal\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nTo see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) logically implies \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the concept of contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg M) \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg M) \\) gives \\( M \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
