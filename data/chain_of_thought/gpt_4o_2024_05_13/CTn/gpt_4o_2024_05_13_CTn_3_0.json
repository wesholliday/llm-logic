The original statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the book was not written by James.\"\n\n3. The logical relationship between \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) and \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is known as the contrapositive. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\n4. Therefore, if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
