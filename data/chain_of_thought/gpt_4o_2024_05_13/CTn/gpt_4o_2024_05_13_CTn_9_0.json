The original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   - Where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\)\n   - Where \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" and \\( \\neg L \\) represents \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nTo see if \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) implies \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg M) \\rightarrow \\neg L \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg M) \\) gives us \\( M \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the statement \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) from \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
