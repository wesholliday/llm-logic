The original statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the statement \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" can be inferred.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding\" and \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\n3. To see if \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) implies \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), we can use the contrapositive.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is the contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), and the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) from \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
