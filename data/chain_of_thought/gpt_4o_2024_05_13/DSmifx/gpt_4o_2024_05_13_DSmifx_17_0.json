The first statement is: \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( M \\lor S \\)\n     - Where \\( M \\) represents \"the flob is movated\"\n     - And \\( S \\) represents \"the flob is skizzled\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flob might not be movated.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that the flob is not movated, but it does not definitively state that the flob is not movated. However, for the purpose of logical inference, we can consider the scenario where the flob is indeed not movated.\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"the flob is not movated\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement: \\( M \\lor S \\)\n- If we assume \\( \\neg M \\) (the flob is not movated), we substitute \\( \\neg M \\) into the first statement:\n  - \\( \\neg M \\lor S \\)\n\nGiven \\( \\neg M \\) is true, the disjunction \\( \\neg M \\lor S \\) can only be true if \\( S \\) is true. Therefore, if the flob is not movated, it must be skizzled.\n\nThus, we can infer that if the flob is not movated, then the flob must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
