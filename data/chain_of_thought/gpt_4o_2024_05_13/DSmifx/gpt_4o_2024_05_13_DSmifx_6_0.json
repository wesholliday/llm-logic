The first statement is: \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor S \\)\n     where \\( P \\) represents \"the grommet is plopped\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the grommet is sploffed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The grommet might not be plopped.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that the grommet is not plopped, but it does not definitively state that the grommet is not plopped. In logical terms, this can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg P \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer \"The grommet is sploffed\" (\\( S \\)), we need to determine if \\( S \\) must be true given the information provided.\n\n- From the first statement \\( P \\lor S \\), we know that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( S \\) must be true.\n- The second statement suggests that \\( P \\) might not be true, but it does not definitively state that \\( P \\) is false.\n\nSince the second statement only indicates a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that \\( P \\) is false. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \\( S \\) must be true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
