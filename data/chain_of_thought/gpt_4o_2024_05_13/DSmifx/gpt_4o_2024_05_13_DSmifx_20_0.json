The first statement is: \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\text{Surned} \\lor \\text{Bluttered} \\)\n   - This means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the fleeg is surned, or the fleeg is bluttered.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fleeg might not be surned.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that the fleeg is not surned.\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( \\neg \\text{Surned} \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer whether \"The fleeg is bluttered,\" we need to consider the logical implications of these statements together.\n\n- From the first statement, we know that if the fleeg is not surned (\\( \\neg \\text{Surned} \\)), then it must be bluttered (\\( \\text{Bluttered} \\)) because one of the two conditions must hold true.\n- The second statement tells us that it is possible that the fleeg is not surned (\\( \\neg \\text{Surned} \\)).\n\nGiven that it is possible for the fleeg to not be surned, and if it is not surned, it must be bluttered, we can infer that the fleeg is indeed bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
