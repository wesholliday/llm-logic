The first statement is: \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( D \\lor C \\)\n     where \\( D \\) represents \"the sprocket is daggled\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the sprocket is cranked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The sprocket might not be daggled.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that the sprocket is not daggled, but it does not definitively state that the sprocket is not daggled. In logical terms, this can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg D \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer \"The sprocket is cranked,\" we need to determine if \\( C \\) must be true based on the given information.\n\n- From the first statement \\( D \\lor C \\), we know that at least one of \\( D \\) or \\( C \\) must be true.\n- The second statement suggests that \\( D \\) might not be true, but it does not definitively state that \\( D \\) is false.\n\nSince the second statement only indicates a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that \\( D \\) is false. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \\( C \\) must be true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
