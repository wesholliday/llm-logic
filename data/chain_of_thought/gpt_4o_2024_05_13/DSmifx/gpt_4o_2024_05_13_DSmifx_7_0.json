The first statement is: \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( T \\lor S \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents \"the whiffle is tinked\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the whiffle is shanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The whiffle might not be tinked.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that the whiffle is not tinked.\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( \\neg T \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer whether \"The whiffle is shanked\" (\\( S \\)) must be true, we need to consider the logical implications of the statements together.\n\n- From the first statement \\( T \\lor S \\), we know that at least one of \\( T \\) or \\( S \\) must be true.\n- The second statement suggests that \\( T \\) might not be true (\\( \\neg T \\) is possible).\n\nIf \\( T \\) is not true (\\( \\neg T \\)), then for the first statement \\( T \\lor S \\) to hold, \\( S \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that \\( T \\) is not true, then \\( S \\) must be true to satisfy the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
