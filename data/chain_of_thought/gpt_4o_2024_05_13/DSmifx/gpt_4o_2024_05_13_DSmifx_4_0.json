The first statement is: \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\text{Crinked} \\lor \\text{Snurgled} \\).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fribble might not be crinked.\"\n   - This means that it is possible that the fribble is not crinked, but it does not definitively state that the fribble is not crinked. In logical terms, this can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg \\text{Crinked} \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer \"The fribble is snurgled,\" we need to determine if the given information logically leads to this conclusion.\n\n- From the first statement, we know that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled. This is because the statement is an \"either/or\" condition.\n- The second statement introduces the possibility that the fribble is not crinked, but it does not confirm it.\n\nSince the second statement only suggests a possibility and does not confirm that the fribble is not crinked, we cannot definitively conclude that the fribble is snurgled. The possibility that the fribble is crinked still exists.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
