The first statement is: \"The flob is not movated.\"\n   - This means that the flob is in a state where it is not movated.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the flob is skizzled, or the flob is movated.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use logical reasoning to infer the following:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the flob is not movated.\n- The second statement tells us that if the flob is not movated, then the only remaining possibility is that the flob is skizzled (since one of the two conditions in the disjunction must be true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the flob must be skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
