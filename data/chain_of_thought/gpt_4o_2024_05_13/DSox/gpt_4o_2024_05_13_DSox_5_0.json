The first statement is: \"The zinger is not smoogled.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acS (where S represents \"the zinger is smoogled\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it is smoogled.\"\n   - This can be written as: F \u2228 S (where F represents \"the zinger is fraggled\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer F (the zinger is fraggled) from \u00acS and F \u2228 S.\n\n3. From \u00acS, we know that S is false.\n   - Therefore, the statement F \u2228 S simplifies to F \u2228 false, which is just F.\n\nSince F \u2228 false is equivalent to F, we can conclude that F must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
