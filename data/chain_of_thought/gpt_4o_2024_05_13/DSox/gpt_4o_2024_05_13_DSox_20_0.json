The first statement is: \"The fleeg is not surned.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acS (where S represents \"the fleeg is surned\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned.\"\n   - This can be written as: B \u2228 S (where B represents \"the fleeg is bluttered\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer B (the fleeg is bluttered) from these statements.\n\n3. From the first statement, we have \u00acS (the fleeg is not surned).\n\n4. The second statement is a disjunction: B \u2228 S (either the fleeg is bluttered or it is surned).\n\n5. Since we know \u00acS (the fleeg is not surned), we can substitute \u00acS into the disjunction B \u2228 S.\n\n6. The disjunction B \u2228 S becomes B \u2228 false, which simplifies to B.\n\nTherefore, given that \u00acS is true and B \u2228 S is true, we can infer that B must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
