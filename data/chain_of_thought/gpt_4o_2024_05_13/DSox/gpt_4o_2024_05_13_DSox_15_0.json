The first statement is: 'The dreb is not spened.'\n   - This means that the dreb is in a state where it is not spened.\n\n2. The second statement is: 'Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened.'\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the dreb is vroombed, or the dreb is spened.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the process of elimination to determine the state of the dreb.\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the dreb is not spened.\n- The second statement tells us that if the dreb is not spened, then it must be vroombed (since one of the two conditions must be true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
