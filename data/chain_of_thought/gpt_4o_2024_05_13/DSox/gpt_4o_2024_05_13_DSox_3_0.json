The first statement is: \"The splat is not quanked.\"\n   - This means that the splat is definitely not in the state of being quanked.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked.\"\n   - This means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: the splat is either morphed or quanked.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use logical reasoning to determine if \"The splat is morphed\" can be inferred.\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the splat is not quanked.\n- The second statement provides two possibilities: the splat is either morphed or quanked.\n- Since the splat cannot be quanked (as per the first statement), the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the splat must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
