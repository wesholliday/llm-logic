The first statement is: \"The fribble is not crinked.\"\n   - This means that the fribble is in a state where it is not crinked.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it is crinked.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the fribble is snurgled, or the fribble is crinked.\n\nGiven these two statements, let's see if we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the fribble is not crinked.\n- From the second statement, we know that if the fribble is not crinked, then the only remaining possibility for the disjunction to hold true is that the fribble must be snurgled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
