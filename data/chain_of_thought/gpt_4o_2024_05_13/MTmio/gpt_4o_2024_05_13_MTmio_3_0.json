It does not definitively state that the book is not a mystery novel, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the book was written by James, then it is definitely a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If the book was written by James, then according to Statement 2, the book must be a mystery novel.\n- However, Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nIf the book might not be a mystery novel (as per Statement 1), then it cannot be the case that the book was written by James (because if it were, it would definitely be a mystery novel, contradicting the possibility raised in Statement 1).\n\nTherefore, the only way to reconcile these statements without contradiction is to conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
