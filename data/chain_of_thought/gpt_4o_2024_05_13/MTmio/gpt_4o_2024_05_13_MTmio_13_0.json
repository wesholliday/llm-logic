            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The car was not red' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"The truck might not have been blue.\"\n   - This means it is possible that the truck was not blue. It does not definitively state that the truck was not blue, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the car was red, then it is certain that the truck was blue.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If the car was red, according to Statement 2, the truck must have been blue.\n- However, Statement 1 suggests that it is possible the truck was not blue.\n\nIf the truck might not have been blue, this possibility contradicts the certainty required by Statement 2 if the car were red. Therefore, for both statements to be true simultaneously, the car cannot be red. If the car were red, the truck would have to be blue, which conflicts with the possibility that the truck might not have been blue.\n\nThus, the only way to reconcile both statements is to conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
