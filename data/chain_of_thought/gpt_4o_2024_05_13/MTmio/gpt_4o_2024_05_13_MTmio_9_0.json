            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This means it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. It does not definitively state that he did not buy it, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then it is certain that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 2, if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n- However, Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nIf Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, then the condition in Statement 2 (that Mark must have bought the blue shirt if Lisa bought the red shirt) cannot be satisfied. Therefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This is because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, Mark would definitely have had to buy the blue shirt, which contradicts the possibility raised in Statement 1.\n\nThus, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
