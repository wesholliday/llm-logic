            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Sue did not choose pizza' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\"\n   - This means it is possible that Bob did not choose pasta. It does not definitively state that Bob did not choose pasta, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if Sue chose pizza, then it is certain that Bob chose pasta.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If Sue chose pizza, then according to Statement 2, Bob must have chosen pasta.\n- However, Statement 1 tells us that it is possible that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nIf we assume that Sue chose pizza, then according to Statement 2, Bob must have chosen pasta. This would contradict Statement 1, which allows for the possibility that Bob did not choose pasta. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, Sue cannot have chosen pizza.\n\nThus, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza to maintain consistency between the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
