            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The bear was not in the cave' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"The wolf might not have been in the den.\"\n   - This means it is possible that the wolf was not in the den. It does not definitively state that the wolf was not in the den, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the bear was in the cave, then it is necessary that the wolf was in the den.\n\nTo infer 'The bear was not in the cave,' we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the wolf was not in the den.\n- From Statement 2, if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nIf we assume that the bear was in the cave, then according to Statement 2, the wolf must have been in the den. However, Statement 1 suggests that it is possible the wolf was not in the den. This creates a contradiction if we assume the bear was in the cave because it would mean the wolf must have been in the den (from Statement 2), but it is also possible that the wolf was not in the den (from Statement 1).\n\nTo resolve this contradiction, the only logical conclusion is that the bear was not in the cave. This way, there is no requirement for the wolf to be in the den, and the possibility that the wolf was not in the den remains consistent.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
