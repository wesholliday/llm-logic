            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"The banana might not have been yellow.\"\n   - This means that it is possible that the banana was not yellow. It does not definitively state that the banana was not yellow, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the apple was red, then it is certain that the banana was yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If the apple was red, then according to Statement 2, the banana must have been yellow.\n- However, Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the banana was not yellow.\n\nTo reconcile these statements, we need to see if there is a contradiction:\n\n- If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow (Statement 2).\n- But Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the banana was not yellow.\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the banana was not yellow, this would contradict Statement 2 if the apple were red. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, the apple cannot be red.\n\nThus, we can infer that the apple was not red to ensure that there is no contradiction between the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
