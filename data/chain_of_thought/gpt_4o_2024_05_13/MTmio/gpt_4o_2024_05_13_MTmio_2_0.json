It does not definitively state that the unicorn was not in the forest, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that the presence of the griffin in the forest guarantees the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n- Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nIf we combine these two pieces of information:\n- If the unicorn might not have been in the forest (Statement 1), then the condition required by Statement 2 (that the unicorn must be in the forest if the griffin is in the forest) cannot be satisfied.\n- Therefore, the griffin cannot have been in the forest, because if it were, the unicorn would have to be there, which contradicts the possibility raised in Statement 1.\n\nThus, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
