It does not definitively state that Chris did not finish, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that Alex finishing the race is a sufficient condition for Chris finishing the race. In other words, if Alex finished, then Chris definitely finished.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible Chris did not finish the race.\n- From Statement 2, if Alex had finished the race, then Chris would have definitely finished the race.\n\nGiven that it is possible Chris did not finish the race (Statement 1), this would contradict the condition in Statement 2 if Alex had finished the race. Therefore, for the possibility of Chris not finishing the race to hold true, Alex must not have finished the race.\n\nThus, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
