In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n     - \u00acR (It is possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter).\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n     - A \u2192 R (If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer 'The alien did not visit Mars' (\u00acA) from these statements.\n\n3. **Analyzing the statements together:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that \u00acR (the robot did not visit Jupiter).\n   - From Statement 2, we have A \u2192 R (if the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter).\n\n4. **Logical Implication:**\n   - If \u00acR is possible (the robot did not visit Jupiter), then for the conditional statement A \u2192 R to hold true, A must be false. This is because if A were true, R would have to be true to satisfy the conditional statement. Since \u00acR is possible, A cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that the robot did not visit Jupiter, it must be the case that the alien did not visit Mars to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
