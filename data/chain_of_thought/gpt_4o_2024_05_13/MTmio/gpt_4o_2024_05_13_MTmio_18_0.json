It does not definitively state that the truck was not metal, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the doll is plastic, then it is necessary for the truck to be metal.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to see if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic.'\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the doll is plastic, the truck must be metal.\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the truck was not metal.\n\nIf the truck might not have been metal, this possibility contradicts the necessity stated in Statement 2 (that the truck must be metal if the doll is plastic). Therefore, for the truck to possibly not be metal, the doll cannot be plastic. \n\nThus, the only way for both statements to be true is if the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
