            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"The pants might not have been denim.\"\n   - This means it is possible that the pants were not denim. It does not definitively state that the pants were not denim, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the shirt is cotton, then it is necessary for the pants to be denim.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to see if we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton.'\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the shirt is cotton, the pants must be denim.\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the pants were not denim.\n\nIf the pants might not have been denim, this possibility contradicts the necessity stated in Statement 2 that the pants must be denim if the shirt is cotton. Therefore, for the possibility of the pants not being denim to hold true, the shirt cannot be cotton. \n\nThus, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton to maintain consistency with the possibility that the pants might not have been denim.\n\nAnswer: yes",
