It does not definitively state that the cat was inside, only that being outside is not certain.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the dog was inside, then it is necessary for the cat to be outside.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If the dog was inside, according to Statement 2, the cat must have been outside.\n- However, Statement 1 suggests that the cat might not have been outside. This implies that there is a possibility that the cat was not outside.\n\nGiven these two statements, if the dog were inside, it would contradict the possibility raised in Statement 1 that the cat might not have been outside. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, the dog cannot be inside.\n\nThus, we can infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
