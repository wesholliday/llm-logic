            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Mary was not at the wedding' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This means it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding. It does not definitively state that Sue was not there, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if Mary was present at the wedding, then Sue's presence is guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If Mary was at the wedding, then according to Statement 2, Sue must have been at the wedding.\n- However, Statement 1 suggests that it is possible Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nIf Sue might not have been at the wedding (as per Statement 1), then the condition in Statement 2 (that Sue must be at the wedding if Mary is there) would be violated if Mary were at the wedding. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, Mary must not have been at the wedding.\n\nThus, based on the given statements, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
