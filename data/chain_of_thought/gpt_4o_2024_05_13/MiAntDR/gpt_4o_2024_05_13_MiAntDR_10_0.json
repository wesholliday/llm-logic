            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The document might be signed or notarized,\" presents two possibilities for the document: it could be signed, or it could be notarized. The use of \"or\" indicates that either one of these conditions could be true independently. Therefore, one of the possibilities mentioned is that the document might be notarized. Since the statement allows for the possibility of notarization, we can infer that the document might indeed be notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes",
