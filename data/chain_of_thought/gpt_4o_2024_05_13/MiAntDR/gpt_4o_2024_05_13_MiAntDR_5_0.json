            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow,\" indicates that there are two possible days for the delivery: today or tomorrow. The use of \"might\" suggests that either day is a potential delivery day, but it does not guarantee delivery on either specific day. \n\nTo infer whether \"The package might be delivered tomorrow\" is true, we need to check if tomorrow is included as one of the possible delivery days in the original statement. Since the original statement explicitly mentions that the package might be delivered either today or tomorrow, it confirms that tomorrow is indeed one of the possible delivery days.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The package might be delivered tomorrow\" is a valid conclusion based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
