            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The room might be cleaned daily or upon request.\" This indicates two possible scenarios for the room being cleaned: either it is cleaned daily, or it is cleaned when requested. The phrase \"or upon request\" explicitly states that one of the conditions under which the room might be cleaned is upon request. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the room might indeed be cleaned upon request.\n\nAnswer: yes",
