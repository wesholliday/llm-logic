It does not definitively state that the clug is not snugged, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It means that at least one of the following must be true:\n     a. The clug is fleeked.\n     b. The clug must be snugged.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the clug is not snugged.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the clug is not fleeked, then it must be snugged.\n\nTo infer \"The clug is fleeked,\" we need to consider the logical implications:\n\n- If the clug is not fleeked, then according to Statement 2, it must be snugged.\n- However, Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the clug is not snugged.\n\nIf the clug is not snugged (a possibility suggested by Statement 1), then according to Statement 2, the clug must be fleeked. This is because the only other option in the disjunction (the clug must be snugged) would be false if the clug is not snugged.\n\nTherefore, given that it is possible for the clug not to be snugged, the only way to satisfy both statements is if the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
