It does not definitively state that the wug is not garpled, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It means that at least one of the following must be true:\n     - The wug is sproinged.\n     - The wug is garpled.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the wug is not sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the wug is not garpled.\n\nIf the wug is not garpled (a possibility suggested by Statement 1), then according to Statement 2, the wug must be sproinged. \n\nTherefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
