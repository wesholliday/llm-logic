The first statement is: \"The flugel might not be zargled.\"\n   - This means it is possible that the flugel is not zargled. It does not definitively state that the flugel is not zargled, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the flugel is blimmed, or it must be zargled.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From the second statement, we know that if the flugel is not blimmed, then it must be zargled.\n- The first statement suggests that it is possible for the flugel not to be zargled.\n\nIf the flugel is not zargled (as suggested by the possibility in the first statement), then according to the second statement, the flugel must be blimmed. \n\nTherefore, the only way for the first statement to hold true (the possibility that the flugel is not zargled) is if the flugel is indeed blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
