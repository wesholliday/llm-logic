It does not definitively state that the fleeg is not surned, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It means that at least one of the following must be true:\n     a. The fleeg is bluttered.\n     b. The fleeg must be surned.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the fleeg is not surned.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered (because the \"or\" condition must hold true).\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the fleeg is not surned, and Statement 2 states that if the fleeg is not surned, it must be bluttered, we can infer that the fleeg must be bluttered in the scenario where it is not surned.\n\nTherefore, considering the logical implications of both statements together, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
