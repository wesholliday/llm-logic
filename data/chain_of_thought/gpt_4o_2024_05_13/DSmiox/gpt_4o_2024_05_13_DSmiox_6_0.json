It does not definitively state that the grommet is not plopped, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It means that at least one of the following must be true:\n     a) The grommet is sploffed.\n     b) The grommet must be plopped.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the grommet is not sploffed, then it must be plopped.\n- Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the grommet is not plopped.\n\nIf the grommet is not plopped (as suggested by the possibility in Statement 1), then according to Statement 2, the grommet must be sploffed. \n\nTherefore, the only way to satisfy both statements is if the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
