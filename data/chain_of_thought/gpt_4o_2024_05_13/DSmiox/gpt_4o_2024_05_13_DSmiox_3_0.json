It does not definitively state that the splat is not quanked, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the splat is morphed, or it must be quanked.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the splat is not quanked.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the splat is not morphed, then it must be quanked.\n\nGiven that it is possible for the splat to not be quanked (Statement 1), if the splat were not morphed, it would have to be quanked (Statement 2). However, since it is possible for the splat to not be quanked, the only way to satisfy both statements is if the splat is morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat must be morphed to satisfy both conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
