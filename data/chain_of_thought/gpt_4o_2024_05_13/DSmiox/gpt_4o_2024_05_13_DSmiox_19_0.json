It does not definitively state that the smonk is not plagged, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement). It means that at least one of the following must be true:\n     a. The smonk is vreebled.\n     b. The smonk must be plagged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- If the smonk is not plagged (as suggested as a possibility in Statement 1), then according to Statement 2, the smonk must be vreebled. This is because the disjunction in Statement 2 requires that if one part (the smonk must be plagged) is false, the other part (the smonk is vreebled) must be true.\n\n- Since Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the smonk is not plagged, and Statement 2 states that if the smonk is not plagged, it must be vreebled, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
