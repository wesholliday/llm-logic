It does not definitively state that the glip is not tragged, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the glip is slogged or it must be tragged.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the glip is slogged, or it must be tragged.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the glip is not slogged, then it must be tragged.\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the glip is not tragged.\n\nIf the glip is not tragged (as suggested by the possibility in Statement 1), then according to Statement 2, the glip must be slogged. This is because the disjunction in Statement 2 requires that if the glip is not tragged, the only remaining option is that it is slogged.\n\nTherefore, given the possibility that the glip is not tragged, we can infer that the glip must be slogged to satisfy the condition in Statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
