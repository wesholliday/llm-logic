It does not definitively state that the flug is not zimmed, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2: \"Either the flug is blummed or it must be zimmed.\"**\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n     - The flug is blummed.\n     - The flug must be zimmed.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the flug is not blummed, then it must be zimmed.\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the flug is not zimmed.\n\nIf the flug is not zimmed (as suggested by the possibility in Statement 1), then according to Statement 2, the flug must be blummed. This is because the disjunction in Statement 2 requires that if the flug is not zimmed, the only remaining option is that the flug is blummed.\n\nTherefore, given the possibility that the flug is not zimmed, we can infer that the flug must be blummed to satisfy the conditions of Statement 2.\n\nAnswer: yes",
