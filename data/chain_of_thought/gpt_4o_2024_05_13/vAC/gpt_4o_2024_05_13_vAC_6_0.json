The first premise is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sue chose pizza.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\).\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( P \\)\n\nTo determine if the conclusion \\( P \\) logically follows from the premises, we need to see if the premises lead to the conclusion through valid logical reasoning.\n\nThe argument form here is:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n2. \\( Q \\)\n3. Therefore, \\( P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a logical fallacy. In valid logical reasoning, the conclusion \\( P \\) does not necessarily follow from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\). The correct form that would be valid is \"modus ponens\" (if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( P \\), then \\( Q \\)) or \"modus tollens\" (if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), then \\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nSince the argument is affirming the consequent, it is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
