The first premise is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow W \\), where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The wolf was in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( W \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The bear was in the cave.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\).\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if \\( B \\) logically follows from \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) and \\( W \\).\n\nIn logical terms, the argument can be represented as:\n1. \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n2. \\( W \\)\n3. \\( \\therefore B \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Affirming the consequent means assuming that if \\( W \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must also be true, which is not necessarily the case. The truth of \\( W \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( B \\); \\( W \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( B \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
