The first premise is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The doll was plastic.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( Q \\)\n- Therefore, \\( P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. In logical terms, just because \\( Q \\) is true, it does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) must be true. There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
