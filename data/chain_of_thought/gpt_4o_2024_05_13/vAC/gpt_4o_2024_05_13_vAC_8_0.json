The first premise is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The vampire was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\).\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if \\( V \\) necessarily follows from \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\).\n\n- The first premise \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) tells us that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( M \\) tells us that \\( M \\) is true.\n\nHowever, knowing that \\( M \\) is true does not provide any information about \\( V \\). \\( M \\) being true could be the result of \\( V \\) being true, but it could also be true independently of \\( V \\). Therefore, we cannot conclude \\( V \\) from \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\).\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion \\( V \\) does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
