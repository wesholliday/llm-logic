The first premise is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Erin took a train.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sam took a plane.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n2. \\( Q \\)\n3. \\( \\therefore P \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion \\( P \\) necessarily follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logical terms, this form of argument is known as \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a formal fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of \\( Q \\) (Erin took a train) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\) (Sam took a plane). There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
