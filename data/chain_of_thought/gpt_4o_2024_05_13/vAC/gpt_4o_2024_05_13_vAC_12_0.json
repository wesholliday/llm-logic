The first premise is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Joe went to the park.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n2. \\( Q \\)\n3. \\( \\therefore P \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion \\( P \\) necessarily follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nThis form of argument is known as affirming the consequent, which is a logical fallacy. Affirming the consequent means assuming that if \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must also be true, which is not necessarily the case. The truth of \\( Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( P \\) because \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
