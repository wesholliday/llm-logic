The first premise is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow R \\), where \\( A \\) represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( R \\) represents \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( R \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The alien visited Mars.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\).\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if \\( A \\) necessarily follows from \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and \\( R \\).\n\nIn logical terms, an argument is valid if the conclusion must be true whenever the premises are true. Here, we have:\n\n- \\( A \\rightarrow R \\)\n- \\( R \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( A \\) must be true given these premises.\n\nHowever, from \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and \\( R \\), we cannot conclude \\( A \\). The statement \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) only tells us that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( R \\) must be true. It does not tell us anything about the truth of \\( A \\) if \\( R \\) is true. \\( R \\) being true does not imply \\( A \\) is true; \\( R \\) could be true independently of \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( A \\) does not logically follow from the premises \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and \\( R \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
