The first premise is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The book was written by James.\" This can be symbolized as: \\( P \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n2. \\( Q \\)\n3. Therefore, \\( P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a logical fallacy. In logical terms, just because \\( Q \\) is true, it does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) must be true. There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\).\n\nFor example, there could be other authors who write mystery novels, so the fact that the book is a mystery novel does not necessarily mean it was written by James.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
