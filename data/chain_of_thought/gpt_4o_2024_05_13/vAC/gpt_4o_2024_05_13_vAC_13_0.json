The first premise is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The truck was blue.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The car was red.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( Q \\)\n- Therefore, \\( P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a logical fallacy. In formal logic, affirming the consequent does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent. Just because \\( Q \\) (the truck was blue) is true, it does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) (the car was red) is true. There could be other reasons why the truck was blue that are not related to the car being red.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
