The first premise is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), where \\( A \\) represents \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The apple was red.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( B \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( A \\)\n\nTo determine if this argument is valid, we need to check if the conclusion \\( A \\) necessarily follows from the premises \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nIn logic, the form of this argument is known as \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a formal fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of \\( B \\) (the banana was yellow) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( A \\) (the apple was red). There could be other reasons why \\( B \\) is true that do not involve \\( A \\) being true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
