            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Mary was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\).\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion \\( M \\) necessarily follows from the premises \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( S \\).\n\nIn logical terms, the argument can be represented as:\n1. \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n2. \\( S \\)\n3. \\( \\therefore M \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a logical fallacy. Affirming the consequent means assuming that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true, which is not necessarily the case. The truth of \\( S \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( M \\); it only tells us that if \\( M \\) were true, then \\( S \\) would be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( M \\) does not logically follow from the premises \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( S \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
