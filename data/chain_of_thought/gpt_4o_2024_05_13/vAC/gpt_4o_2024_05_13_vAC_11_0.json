The first premise is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The cake was chocolate.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\)\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n2. \\( Q \\)\n3. Therefore, \\( P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"affirming the consequent,\" which is a logical fallacy. In logical terms, just because \\( Q \\) is true, it does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) must be true. There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
