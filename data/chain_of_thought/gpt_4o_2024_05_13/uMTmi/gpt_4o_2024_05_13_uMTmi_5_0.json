The contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\), which means \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nSince it is possible that \\( A \\) is false (Amy did not play tennis), it follows that \\( J \\) must be false (Jeff did not play basketball) in that scenario.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
