Let's denote:\n     - \\( C \\) as \"the car was red\"\n     - \\( T \\) as \"the truck was blue\"\n   - The statement can be written as: \\( C \\rightarrow T \\)\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The truck might not have been blue.\"\n   - This means that it is possible that \\( T \\) is false. In logical terms, this means \\( \\neg T \\) (not \\( T \\)) is possible.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1: \\( C \\rightarrow T \\)\n- From Statement 2: \\( \\neg T \\) is possible.\n\nIf \\( \\neg T \\) is possible, then \\( T \\) might be false. According to the conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow T \\), if \\( C \\) were true, then \\( T \\) must be true. However, since \\( T \\) might be false, \\( C \\) cannot be true because it would contradict the conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, if \\( T \\) might be false, \\( C \\) must be false to avoid contradiction.\n\nAnswer: yes",
