It means that if Sue chose pizza, it is necessary for Bob to have chosen pasta.\n\n2. \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\"\n   - This statement indicates that it is possible that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta (from statement 1).\n- However, it is possible that Bob did not choose pasta (from statement 2).\n\nIf it is possible that Bob did not choose pasta, then the condition \"if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\" cannot hold true. Therefore, Sue cannot have chosen pizza because it would contradict the possibility that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nThus, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
