            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding, let's analyze the given statements step by step:\n\n1. \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding).\n\n2. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This means that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding. In logical terms, this means \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding) is possible.\n\nTo infer whether Mary was not at the wedding, we need to consider the implications of these statements together:\n\n- From the first statement, if Mary was at the wedding (\\( M \\)), then Sue must have been at the wedding (\\( S \\)).\n- From the second statement, it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding (\\( \\neg S \\)).\n\nIf \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding) is possible, then \\( S \\) (Sue was at the wedding) is not necessarily true. Given the first statement (\\( M \\rightarrow S \\)), if \\( S \\) is not true, then \\( M \\) cannot be true either. This is because if Mary were at the wedding, Sue would have to be there as well, which contradicts the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that Sue was not at the wedding implies that Mary could not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
