In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( S \\rightarrow E \\), where \\( S \\) represents \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( E \\) represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. \"Erin might not have taken a train.\"\n   - This means that it is possible that Erin did not take a train. In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( \\neg E \\) is possible.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From the first statement, \\( S \\rightarrow E \\), we know that if Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n- From the second statement, we know that it is possible that Erin did not take a train (\\( \\neg E \\)).\n\nIf \\( \\neg E \\) is possible, then \\( E \\) is not necessarily true. According to the first statement, if \\( E \\) is not true, then \\( S \\) cannot be true either because \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) would be violated.\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that Erin did not take a train, it must be the case that Sam did not take a plane. \n\nAnswer: no",
