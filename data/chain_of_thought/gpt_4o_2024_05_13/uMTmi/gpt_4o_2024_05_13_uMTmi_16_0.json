            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that the shirt was not cotton, let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Conditional Statement**: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\text{Shirt is cotton} \\rightarrow \\text{Pants are denim} \\).\n\n2. **Possibility Statement**: \"The pants might not have been denim.\"\n   - This means that it is possible for the pants to not be denim.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From the conditional statement, if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim. This means that if the pants are not denim, then the shirt cannot be cotton (contrapositive of the conditional statement).\n\n- The possibility statement indicates that there is a scenario where the pants are not denim.\n\nGiven that the pants might not have been denim, we need to consider the contrapositive of the conditional statement:\n- If the pants are not denim, then the shirt is not cotton.\n\nSince it is possible for the pants to not be denim, in that scenario, the shirt cannot be cotton.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
