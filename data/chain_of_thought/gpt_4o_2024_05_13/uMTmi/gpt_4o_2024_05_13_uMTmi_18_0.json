Let's denote:\n     - P: The doll was plastic.\n     - Q: The truck was metal.\n   - The statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q).\n\n2. \"The truck might not have been metal.\"\n   - This means that it is possible that Q is false (\u00acQ).\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications:\n\n- From the first statement (P \u2192 Q), if P is true, then Q must be true.\n- From the second statement (\u00acQ is possible), it suggests that Q might be false.\n\nIf Q is false (\u00acQ), then according to the contrapositive of the first statement (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), P must also be false. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if the truck might not have been metal (\u00acQ is possible), it implies that the doll was not plastic (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
