This is because if Ben had eaten pasta, Kate would have had to eat salad, which contradicts the possibility that she might not have eaten salad.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that Kate did not eat salad leads us to conclude that Ben did not eat pasta, as it would violate the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
