If \\( \\neg R \\) is possible, then \\( \\neg A \\) must also be possible according to the contrapositive.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nSince \\( \\neg R \\) (the robot did not visit Jupiter) is a possibility, and the contrapositive tells us that \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), it follows that \\( \\neg A \\) (the alien did not visit Mars) is also a possibility.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
