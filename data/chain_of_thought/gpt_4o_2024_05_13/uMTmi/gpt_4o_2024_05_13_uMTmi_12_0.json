If \\( L \\) is false, then \\( J \\) cannot be true because \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) would be violated.\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that \\( L \\) is false, then \\( J \\) must be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nThus, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
