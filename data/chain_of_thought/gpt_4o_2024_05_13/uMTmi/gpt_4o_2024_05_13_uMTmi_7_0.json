This is because if Alex had finished the race, Chris would have had to finish the race as well, which contradicts the possibility that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that Chris did not finish the race, it must be the case that Alex did not finish the race. This is the only way to satisfy both the conditional statement and the possibility statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
