If \\( M \\) is false, then \\( V \\) cannot be true because it would violate the conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\).\n\nTherefore, if there is a possibility that \\( M \\) is false, then \\( V \\) must be false to satisfy the conditional statement.\n\nThus, we can infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
