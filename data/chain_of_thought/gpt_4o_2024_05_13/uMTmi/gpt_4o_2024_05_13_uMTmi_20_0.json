If \\( B \\) is false, then \\( A \\) cannot be true because \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) would be violated.\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that the banana was not yellow, then the apple could not have been red. This is because if the apple were red, the banana would have to be yellow, which contradicts the possibility that the banana might not have been yellow.\n\nThus, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
