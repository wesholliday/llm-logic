In logical terms, it can be written as: If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the splat was morphed\" and Q is \"the splat quanked.\"\n\nGiven that P is false (from Statement 1), we need to determine if Q (the splat quanked) can be inferred to be false.\n\nIn logic, if the antecedent (P) of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is false, the conditional statement is considered true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (Q). This means that from the falsehood of P alone, we cannot infer the truth value of Q.\n\nTherefore, from the information given:\n- We know that the splat was not morphed.\n- We know that if the splat was morphed, then it would have quanked.\n- However, since the splat was not morphed, we cannot conclude whether it quanked or not.\n\nThus, we cannot infer 'The splat did not quank' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
