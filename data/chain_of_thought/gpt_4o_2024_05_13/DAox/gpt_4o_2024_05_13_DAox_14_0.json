The implication F \u2192 S is vacuously true when F is false, regardless of the truth value of S.\n\n4. **Given \u00acF:**\n   - We know that F is false (the clug was not fleeked).\n   - Since F is false, the implication F \u2192 S does not help us determine the truth value of S.\n\nTherefore, from \u00acF and F \u2192 S, we cannot infer \u00acS. The truth value of S remains undetermined based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
