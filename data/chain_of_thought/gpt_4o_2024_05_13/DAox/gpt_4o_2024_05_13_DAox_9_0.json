It means that if the twonk had been plinked, it would necessarily have been varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider what we need to infer: \"The twonk was not varnished.\"\n\nTo infer this, we need to establish that the twonk was definitely not varnished. Let's use the information we have:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know the twonk was not plinked.\n- From Statement 2, we know that being plinked is a necessary condition for being varnished. In other words, if the twonk is not plinked, it cannot be varnished because the condition for varnishing (being plinked) is not met.\n\nSince the twonk was not plinked (Statement 1), the condition for it to be varnished (being plinked) is not satisfied. Therefore, the twonk cannot be varnished.\n\nThus, we can infer that the twonk was not varnished.\n\nAnswer: yes",
