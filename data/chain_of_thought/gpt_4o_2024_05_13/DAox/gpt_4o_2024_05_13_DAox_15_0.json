The first statement is: 'The dreb was not vroombed.'\n2. The second statement is: 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.'\n\nWe need to determine if 'The dreb was not spened' logically follows from these statements.\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the dreb was not vroombed.\n- The second statement is a conditional statement: 'If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.'\n\nIn logical terms, the second statement can be written as: \n\\[ \\text{vroombed} \\rightarrow \\text{spened} \\]\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the dreb was not vroombed, we have:\n\\[ \\neg \\text{vroombed} \\]\n\nIn logic, if the antecedent (the first part of the conditional statement) is false, the conditional statement as a whole is true regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the second part). Therefore, the second statement does not provide any information about whether the dreb was spened or not when the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nThus, from the given information, we cannot infer whether the dreb was spened or not.\n\nAnswer: no",
