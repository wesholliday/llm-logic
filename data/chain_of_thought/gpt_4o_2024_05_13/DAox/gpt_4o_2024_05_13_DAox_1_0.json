It tells us that if the flugel had been blimmed, then it would necessarily have been zargled.\n\nNow, let's consider what we need to infer 'The flugel was not zargled.'\n\n- The conditional statement (Statement 2) only tells us what happens if the flugel is blimmed. It does not provide any information about what happens if the flugel is not blimmed.\n- From Statement 1, we know that the flugel was not blimmed. However, the conditional statement does not give us any information about the zargled status of the flugel when it is not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude anything about whether the flugel was zargled or not based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
