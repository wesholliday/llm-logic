It tells us that if the fleeg was in a state of being bluttered, then it would have surned.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the fleeg had been bluttered, it would have surned.\n\nSince the fleeg was not bluttered (Statement 1), the condition in Statement 2 (\"If the fleeg was bluttered\") is not met. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the fleeg surned based on the given information.\n\nSince the fleeg was not bluttered, and the only condition under which it would have surned is if it had been bluttered, we can infer that the fleeg did not surn.\n\nAnswer: yes",
