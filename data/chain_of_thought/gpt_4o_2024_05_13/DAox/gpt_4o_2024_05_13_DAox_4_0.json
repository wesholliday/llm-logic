            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The fribble did not crink' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"The fribble was not snurgled.\"\n   - This means that the fribble did not undergo the action of being snurgled.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that snurgling the fribble is a sufficient condition for the fribble to crink. In other words, if the fribble had been snurgled, it would have crinked.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to see if we can infer 'The fribble did not crink':\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that the fribble was not snurgled.\n- According to Statement 2, the fribble crinking is dependent on the fribble being snurgled. Since the fribble was not snurgled, the condition for the fribble to crink is not met.\n\nTherefore, if the fribble was not snurgled, it cannot have crinked because the condition required for crinking (being snurgled) was not satisfied.\n\nAnswer: yes",
