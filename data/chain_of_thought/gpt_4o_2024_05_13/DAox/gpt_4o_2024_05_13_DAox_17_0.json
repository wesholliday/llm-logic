The first statement is: \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n   - This means that the condition of the flob being skizzled is false.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. In logical terms, it can be written as: If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the flob was skizzled\" and Q is \"the flob movated.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we need to determine if we can infer \"The flob was not movated.\"\n\n3. From the first statement, we know that P (the flob was skizzled) is false.\n\n4. In a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), if P is false, the conditional statement is true regardless of the truth value of Q. This means that the second statement does not provide any information about the truth value of Q when P is false.\n\n5. Therefore, from the information given, we cannot determine whether Q (the flob movated) is true or false.\n\nSince we cannot determine the truth value of Q based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The flob was not movated.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
