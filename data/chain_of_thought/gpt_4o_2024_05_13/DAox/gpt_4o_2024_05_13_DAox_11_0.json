The first statement is: \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acB (where B stands for \"the flug was blummed\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"\n   - This can be written as: B \u2192 Z (where Z stands for \"the flug was zimmed\").\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acZ (the flug was not zimmed) from \u00acB and B \u2192 Z.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- \u00acB means the flug was not blummed.\n- B \u2192 Z means if the flug was blummed, then it was zimmed.\n\nTo infer \u00acZ (the flug was not zimmed), we need to consider the logical relationship between \u00acB and B \u2192 Z.\n\n- If B is false (\u00acB is true), then the implication B \u2192 Z does not provide any information about Z. The implication B \u2192 Z is only concerned with the case when B is true. Since B is false, the implication is vacuously true, and we cannot conclude anything about Z from it.\n\nTherefore, from \u00acB and B \u2192 Z, we cannot infer \u00acZ.\n\nAnswer: no",
