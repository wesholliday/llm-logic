In logical terms, it can be written as: If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"the wug was garpled.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we need to determine if we can infer \"The wug was not garpled.\"\n\n3. **Logical Analysis:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that P (the wug was sproinged) is false.\n   - In a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), if P is false, the statement P \u2192 Q is always true regardless of the truth value of Q. This means that the conditional statement does not provide any information about Q when P is false.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since P is false, we cannot determine the truth value of Q (the wug was garpled) based solely on the given statements. The conditional statement does not imply anything about Q when P is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The wug was not garpled' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
