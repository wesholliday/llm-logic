It means that if the sprocket had been cranked, it would necessarily follow that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nNow, let's consider what we need to infer: \"The sprocket was not daggled.\"\n\nTo infer this, we need to understand the relationship between being cranked and being daggled. The conditional statement tells us that cranking the sprocket is a sufficient condition for it to be daggled, but it does not tell us what happens if the sprocket is not cranked. \n\nIn logical terms:\n- The conditional statement can be written as: \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) (If cranked, then daggled).\n- The contrapositive of this statement is: \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) (If not daggled, then not cranked).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( \\neg C \\) (The sprocket was not cranked).\n\nWe need to determine \\( \\neg D \\) (The sprocket was not daggled).\n\nFrom the given information:\n- We know \\( \\neg C \\) (The sprocket was not cranked).\n- The conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) does not provide information about the state of being daggled when the sprocket is not cranked.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot definitively infer \\( \\neg D \\) (The sprocket was not daggled) because the conditional statement does not cover the scenario where the sprocket is not cranked.\n\nAnswer: no",
