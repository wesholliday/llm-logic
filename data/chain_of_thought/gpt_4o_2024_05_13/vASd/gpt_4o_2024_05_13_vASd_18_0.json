            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If I water the plants, they will grow.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( W \\rightarrow G \\)\n     - Where \\( W \\) stands for \"I water the plants\"\n     - And \\( G \\) stands for \"the plants will grow\"\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( (W \\land \\neg S) \\rightarrow G \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) stands for \"there is sunlight\"\n     - And \\( \\neg S \\) stands for \"there is no sunlight\"\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n- The premise \\( W \\rightarrow G \\) states that watering the plants is a sufficient condition for them to grow.\n- The conclusion \\( (W \\land \\neg S) \\rightarrow G \\) states that watering the plants and having no sunlight is a sufficient condition for them to grow.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the truth of the premise must guarantee the truth of the conclusion. \n\nLet's consider the logical implications:\n- If \\( W \\) is true, then \\( G \\) must be true according to the premise.\n- The conclusion introduces an additional condition \\( \\neg S \\) (no sunlight), but this does not affect the sufficiency of \\( W \\) for \\( G \\) because the premise does not mention sunlight at all.\n\nTherefore, the additional condition \\( \\neg S \\) does not change the fact that \\( W \\) leads to \\( G \\). The conclusion \\( (W \\land \\neg S) \\rightarrow G \\) is still true because \\( W \\) alone is sufficient for \\( G \\).\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
