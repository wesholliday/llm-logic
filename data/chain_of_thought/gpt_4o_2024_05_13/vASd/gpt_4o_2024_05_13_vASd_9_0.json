            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\n   - Symbolically: \\( W \\rightarrow A \\)\n   - Where \\( W \\) represents \"the essay is well-written\" and \\( A \\) represents \"the student will get an A\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\n   - Symbolically: \\( (W \\land L) \\rightarrow A \\)\n   - Where \\( L \\) represents \"the essay is turned in late\".\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n- The premise \\( W \\rightarrow A \\) states that if the essay is well-written, the student will get an A.\n- The conclusion \\( (W \\land L) \\rightarrow A \\) states that if the essay is well-written and turned in late, the student will get an A.\n\nThe key point here is that the conclusion adds an additional condition (the essay being turned in late) to the antecedent. However, the original premise does not specify anything about the timing of the submission; it only states that a well-written essay guarantees an A.\n\nIn logical terms, if \\( W \\rightarrow A \\) is true, then \\( (W \\land L) \\rightarrow A \\) must also be true because \\( W \\land L \\) is a more specific case of \\( W \\). If \\( W \\) guarantees \\( A \\), then any additional condition combined with \\( W \\) (such as \\( L \\)) does not change the outcome \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
