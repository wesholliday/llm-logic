            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time.\n   - Symbolically: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"we go to the concert\" and \\( Q \\) is \"we'll have a good time\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.\n   - Symbolically: \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( R \\) is \"a bomb goes off\".\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n- The premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) states that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- The conclusion \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) states that if both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n\nFor the conclusion to be valid, it must be true in all cases where the premise is true. Let's consider the truth table for these statements:\n\n| \\( P \\) | \\( R \\) | \\( Q \\) | \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) | \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) |\n|--------|--------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------------|\n| T      | T      | T      | T                     | T                           |\n| T      | T      | F      | F                     | T                           |\n| T      | F      | T      | T                     | T                           |\n| T      | F      | F      | F                     | T                           |\n| F      | T      | T      | T                     | T                           |\n| F      | T      | F      | T                     | T                           |\n| F      | F      | T      | T                     | T                           |\n| F      | F      | F      | T                     | T                           |\n\nFrom the truth table, we see that whenever \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) is also true. This means that the conclusion \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) logically follows from the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
