The premise is: \"If the car is in the garage, then it is safe.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The car is in the garage\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The car is safe.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( R \\) is \"The garage is flooding.\"\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n- The premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) states that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n- The conclusion \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) states that if both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n\nSince \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) guarantees that \\( Q \\) is true whenever \\( P \\) is true, adding an additional condition \\( R \\) (the garage is flooding) does not change the fact that \\( Q \\) must still be true if \\( P \\) is true. Therefore, \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically valid because it is a more specific case of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
