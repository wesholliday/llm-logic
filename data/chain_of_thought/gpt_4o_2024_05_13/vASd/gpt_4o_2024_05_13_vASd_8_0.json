            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise:** If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today.\n   - Symbolically: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the package has shipped\" and \\( Q \\) is \"it will arrive today\".\n\n2. **Conclusion:** If the package has shipped and it was misrouted, then it will arrive today.\n   - Symbolically: \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( R \\) is \"it was misrouted\".\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n- The premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) states that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- The conclusion \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) states that if both \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n\nLet's break it down:\n- If \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true (from the premise).\n- If \\( P \\) and \\( R \\) are both true, then \\( P \\) is still true (since \\( P \\land R \\) implies \\( P \\)).\n- Since \\( P \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must be true (from the premise).\n\nTherefore, if \\( P \\land R \\) is true, \\( Q \\) must be true, which means \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) is true.\n\nThus, the conclusion logically follows from the premise, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
