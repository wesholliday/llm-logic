            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If I study hard, I will pass the test.\n   - Symbolically: \\( S \\rightarrow P \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"I study hard\" and \\( P \\) represents \"I will pass the test\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If I study hard and the test is in Chinese, I will pass the test.\n   - Symbolically: \\( (S \\land C) \\rightarrow P \\)\n     - Where \\( C \\) represents \"the test is in Chinese\".\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n- The premise \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) states that studying hard is a sufficient condition for passing the test.\n- The conclusion \\( (S \\land C) \\rightarrow P \\) states that studying hard and the test being in Chinese together are sufficient conditions for passing the test.\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion can be derived from the premise. \n\n- If \\( S \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be true according to the premise.\n- If \\( S \\) and \\( C \\) are both true, then \\( S \\) is still true, and thus \\( P \\) must be true according to the premise.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( (S \\land C) \\rightarrow P \\) logically follows from the premise \\( S \\rightarrow P \\). The additional condition \\( C \\) does not affect the truth of \\( P \\) as long as \\( S \\) is true.\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
