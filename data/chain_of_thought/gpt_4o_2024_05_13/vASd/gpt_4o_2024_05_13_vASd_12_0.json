            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If I finish my homework, I can play video games.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( H \\rightarrow V \\)\n     - Where \\( H \\) stands for \"I finish my homework\"\n     - And \\( V \\) stands for \"I can play video games\"\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games.\n   - This can be represented as: \\( (H \\land F) \\rightarrow V \\)\n     - Where \\( F \\) stands for \"my computer catches on fire\"\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n- The premise \\( H \\rightarrow V \\) states that if \\( H \\) is true, then \\( V \\) must be true.\n- The conclusion \\( (H \\land F) \\rightarrow V \\) states that if both \\( H \\) and \\( F \\) are true, then \\( V \\) must be true.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, whenever the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's consider the truth table for the involved propositions:\n\n| \\( H \\) | \\( F \\) | \\( V \\) | \\( H \\rightarrow V \\) | \\( (H \\land F) \\rightarrow V \\) |\n|--------|--------|--------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|\n| T      | T      | T      | T                     | T                             |\n| T      | T      | F      | F                     | T                             |\n| T      | F      | T      | T                     | T                             |\n| T      | F      | F      | F                     | T                             |\n| F      | T      | T      | T                     | T                             |\n| F      | T      | F      | T                     | T                             |\n| F      | F      | T      | T                     | T                             |\n| F      | F      | F      | T                     | T                             |\n\nFrom the truth table, we see that whenever \\( H \\rightarrow V \\) is true, \\( (H \\land F) \\rightarrow V \\) is also true. This means that the conclusion \\( (H \\land F) \\rightarrow V \\) logically follows from the premise \\( H \\rightarrow V \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
