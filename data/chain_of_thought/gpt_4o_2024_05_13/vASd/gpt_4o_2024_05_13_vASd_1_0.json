However, the premise does not account for the condition of the match being soaked in water. In fact, soaking a match in water typically prevents it from lighting, which contradicts the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion introduces an additional condition (the match being soaked in water) that is not supported by the premise. This means the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
