            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"you get enough sleep\" and \\( T \\) represents \"you are tired\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (S \\land H) \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n     - Where \\( H \\) represents \"you do hard labor\".\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\n- The premise \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) states that if you get enough sleep, then you will not be tired.\n- The conclusion \\( (S \\land H) \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) states that if you get enough sleep and do hard labor, then you will not be tired.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the truth of the premise must guarantee the truth of the conclusion. However, the premise does not provide any information about the effect of doing hard labor on being tired. The premise only states that getting enough sleep alone is sufficient to prevent tiredness, but it does not account for additional factors like hard labor.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion introduces a new condition (doing hard labor) that is not addressed by the premise. This means the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
