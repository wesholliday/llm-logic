The first statement is: \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This means that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the cookies are in the pantry, or they are in the jar.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the process of elimination:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n- The second statement tells us that if the cookies are not in the pantry, then they must be in the jar (since one of the two conditions must be true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can logically infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
