The first statement is: \"The watch isn't on his wrist.\"\n   - This means the watch is not on his wrist.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the watch is on his wrist, or it is charging on the dresser.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the process of elimination:\n\n- From the first statement, we know the watch is not on his wrist.\n- The second statement tells us that if the watch is not on his wrist, then it must be charging on the dresser (since one of the two conditions must be true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
