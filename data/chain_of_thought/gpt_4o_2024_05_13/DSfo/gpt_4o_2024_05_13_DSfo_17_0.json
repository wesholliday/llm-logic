The first statement is: \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\"\n   - This means that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the scarf is on the coat rack, or it is in the backpack.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use logical reasoning to infer the conclusion:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n- The second statement tells us that if the scarf is not on the coat rack, then it must be in the backpack (since one of the two conditions must be true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the scarf must be in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
