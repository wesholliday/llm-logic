The first statement is: \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This means that the keys are not in the cabinet.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the keys are in the cabinet, or they are in the drawer.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the process of elimination:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the keys are not in the cabinet.\n- The second statement tells us that if the keys are not in the cabinet, then they must be in the drawer (since one of the two conditions must be true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
