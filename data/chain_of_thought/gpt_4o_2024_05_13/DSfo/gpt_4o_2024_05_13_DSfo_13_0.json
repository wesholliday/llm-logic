The first statement is: \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\"\n   - This means the toy is not on the shelf.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the toy is sitting on the shelf or it is in the toy box.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the toy is on the shelf, or it is in the toy box.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the process of elimination:\n\n- From the first statement, we know the toy is not on the shelf.\n- The second statement tells us that if the toy is not on the shelf, then it must be in the toy box (since one of the two conditions must be true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
