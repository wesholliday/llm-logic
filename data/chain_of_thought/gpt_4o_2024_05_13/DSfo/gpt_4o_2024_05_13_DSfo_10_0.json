The first statement is: \"The missing sock isn't under the bed.\"\n   - This can be written as: \"The missing sock is not under the bed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the missing sock is under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\"\n   - This can be written as: \"The missing sock is under the bed or the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nWe can represent these statements using logical notation:\n- Let \\( A \\) represent \"The missing sock is under the bed.\"\n- Let \\( B \\) represent \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nThe statements can then be written as:\n1. \\( \\neg A \\) (The missing sock is not under the bed)\n2. \\( A \\lor B \\) (The missing sock is under the bed or the missing sock is in the laundry basket)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( B \\) (The missing sock is in the laundry basket) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic:\n- From \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and \\( \\neg A \\) (not \\( A \\)), we can infer \\( B \\) (the other option must be true).\n\nTherefore, given that the sock is not under the bed and it must be either under the bed or in the laundry basket, we can conclude that the sock must be in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
