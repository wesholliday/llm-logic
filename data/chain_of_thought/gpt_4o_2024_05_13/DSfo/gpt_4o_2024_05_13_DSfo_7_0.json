The first statement is: \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\"\n   - This means the umbrella is not in the closet.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the umbrella is in the closet, or it is in the car.\n\nGiven these two statements:\n- From the first statement, we know the umbrella is not in the closet.\n- The second statement tells us that if the umbrella is not in the closet, then it must be in the car (since one of the two conditions must be true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can logically infer that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: yes",
