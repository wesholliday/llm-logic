This means that the wug being not bimmed is a potential scenario.\n\nGiven these points, if we consider the scenario where the wug is not bimmed (which is possible according to statement 1), then according to statement 2, the wug must be flooped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the wug is not bimmed, it must be flooped. Since statement 1 allows for the possibility that the wug is not bimmed, we can conclude that in that case, the wug would indeed be flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
