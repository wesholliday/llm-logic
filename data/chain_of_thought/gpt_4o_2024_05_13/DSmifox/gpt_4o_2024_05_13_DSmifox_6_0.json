It does not definitively state that the grommet is not plopped, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the grommet is plopped, or it is sploffed.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n- Statement 1 suggests that the grommet might not be plopped, which means there is a possibility that the grommet is not plopped.\n\nGiven that there is a possibility that the grommet is not plopped, and from Statement 2, if the grommet is not plopped, it must be sploffed, we can infer that if the grommet is indeed not plopped, then it must be sploffed.\n\nHowever, since Statement 1 only indicates a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that the grommet is sploffed. We can only conclude that it is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: no",
