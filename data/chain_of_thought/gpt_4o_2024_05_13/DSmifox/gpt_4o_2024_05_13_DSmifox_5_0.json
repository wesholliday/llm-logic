It does not definitively state that the zinger is not smoogled, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the zinger is smoogled, or the zinger is fraggled.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that at least one of the following must be true:\n  1. The zinger is smoogled.\n  2. The zinger is fraggled.\n\n- Statement 1 tells us that it is possible that the zinger is not smoogled. If the zinger is not smoogled, then according to Statement 2, the zinger must be fraggled (since one of the two conditions must hold true).\n\nTherefore, if the zinger is not smoogled, it must be fraggled. Since Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the zinger is not smoogled, we can infer that in that case, the zinger would indeed be fraggled.\n\nThus, we can conclude that the zinger is fraggled if it is not smoogled, which aligns with the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
