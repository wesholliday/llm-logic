This means that \"the shank is not nugged\" is a possible scenario.\n- From statement 2, we have a conditional statement: \"If the shank is not nugged, then it is plooked.\"\n\nGiven that it is possible for the shank to not be nugged (from statement 1), we can apply the conditional statement from statement 2. If the shank is indeed not nugged, then according to statement 2, the shank must be plooked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
