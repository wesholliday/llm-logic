In logical terms, this can be expressed as:\n     - It is not necessarily true that the flob is movated.\n     - This does not provide a definitive statement about the flob being movated or not; it only suggests a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\"\n   - This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n     - The flob is movated.\n     - The flob is skizzled.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the flob is not movated.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the flob is not movated, then it must be skizzled (because one of the two conditions in the disjunction must hold true).\n\nGiven that it is possible for the flob to not be movated (Statement 1), and if it is not movated, it must be skizzled (Statement 2), we can infer that the flob must be skizzled if it is not movated.\n\nHowever, Statement 1 does not definitively state that the flob is not movated; it only suggests a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the flob is skizzled based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
