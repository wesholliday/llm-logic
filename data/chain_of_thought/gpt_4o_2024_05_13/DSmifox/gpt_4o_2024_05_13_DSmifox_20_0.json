It does not definitively state that the fleeg is not surned, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the fleeg is surned, or it is bluttered.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n- Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nGiven that it is possible for the fleeg to not be surned, and if it is not surned, it must be bluttered (according to Statement 2), we can infer that the fleeg being bluttered is a necessary condition if it is not surned.\n\nHowever, since Statement 1 only suggests a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that the fleeg is bluttered. We only know that if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered, but we do not have enough information to confirm that the fleeg is indeed not surned.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
