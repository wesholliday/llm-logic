It does not definitively state that the splat is not quanked, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the splat is quanked, or the splat is morphed.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the splat is not quanked.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed (because one of the two conditions must hold true).\n\nGiven that it is possible for the splat to not be quanked (Statement 1), and if it is not quanked, it must be morphed (Statement 2), we can infer that the splat being morphed is a necessary condition if the splat is not quanked.\n\nHowever, since Statement 1 only states a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that the splat is morphed. We can only conclude that if the splat is not quanked, then it must be morphed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The splat is morphed\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
