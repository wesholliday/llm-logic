First premise: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"The keys are in the drawer\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\n2. Second premise: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( P \\lor Q \\), we know that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg Q \\), we know that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( Q \\) is false, the only way for the first premise \\( P \\lor Q \\) to be true is if \\( P \\) is true. Therefore, \\( P \\) must be true.\n\nSince \\( P \\) represents \"The keys are in the drawer,\" the conclusion \\( P \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
