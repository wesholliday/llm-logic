The first premise is: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"The book is on the shelf\" and \\( B \\) is \"The book must be resting on the table.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( A \\lor B \\), we know that at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg B \\), we know that \\( B \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( B \\) is false, the only way for the first premise \\( A \\lor B \\) to be true is if \\( A \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( A \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
