The first premise is: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( P \\)\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism, if we have a disjunction \\( P \\lor Q \\) and we know that \\( \\neg Q \\) (Q is false), then \\( P \\) must be true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\lor Q \\) (Either P or Q is true)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) (Q is false)\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that \\( P \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( P \\) (\"The remote control is on the coffee table\") logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
