The first premise is: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"Fido is inside\" and \\( B \\) is \"Fido must be in the garden.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Fido is inside.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( A \\lor B \\), we know that at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg B \\) tells us that \\( B \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( B \\) is false, the disjunction \\( A \\lor B \\) can only be true if \\( A \\) is true. Therefore, \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nSince \\( A \\) represents \"Fido is inside,\" the conclusion \\( A \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
