First premise: \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"The pen is in my bag\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The pen must be on my desk.\"\n\n2. Second premise: \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. Conclusion: \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The first premise \\( P \\lor Q \\) states that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg Q \\) states that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can deduce \\( P \\) using the rule of disjunctive syllogism. Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), then \\( P \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( P \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
