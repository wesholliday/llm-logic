The original statement is 'The snork might be plimp'. This means there is a possibility that the snork is plimp.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The snork might be zibble and plimp'. This means there is a possibility that the snork is both zibble and plimp.\n\nThe key point here is that the original statement only addresses the possibility of the snork being plimp. It does not provide any information about the snork being zibble. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the snork being zibble from the original statement alone.\n\nSince the original statement does not mention 'zibble' at all, we cannot logically infer that the snork might be both zibble and plimp based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
