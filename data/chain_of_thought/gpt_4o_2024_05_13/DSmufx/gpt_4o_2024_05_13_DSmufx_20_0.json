The first statement is: \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"the fleeg must be surned\" and \\( B \\) is \"the fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n     where \\( \\neg A \\) means \"it is not the case that the fleeg must be surned.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (the fleeg is bluttered) from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and \\( \\neg A \\) (not \\( A \\)), we can conclude \\( B \\) (the fleeg is bluttered).\n\nThis is because if one part of the disjunction (either-or statement) is false, the other part must be true for the entire statement to hold true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the fleeg must be surned or it is bluttered\" and \"It's not the case that the fleeg must be surned,\" we can infer \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
