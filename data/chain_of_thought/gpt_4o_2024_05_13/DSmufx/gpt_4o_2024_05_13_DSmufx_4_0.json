The first statement is: \"Either the fribble must be crinked or it is snurgled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( C \\lor S \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents \"the fribble must be crinked\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the fribble is snurgled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n     where \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"it is not the case that the fribble must be crinked.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (the fribble is snurgled) from \\( C \\lor S \\) and \\( \\neg C \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( C \\lor S \\) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\\( \\neg C \\)), then the other disjunct must be true.\n\n4. Given \\( C \\lor S \\) and \\( \\neg C \\), we can conclude \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the statements, we can infer that \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
