The first statement is: \"Either the smonk must be plagged or it is vreebled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor V \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the smonk must be plagged\"\n     - And \\( V \\) represents \"the smonk is vreebled\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) means \"it is not the case that the smonk must be plagged\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( V \\) (the smonk is vreebled) from \\( P \\lor V \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( P \\lor V \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( V \\) is true)\n   - And we have \\( \\neg P \\) (it is not the case that \\( P \\) is true)\n   - Then we can conclude \\( V \\) (the other disjunct must be true)\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\lor V \\)\n- \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- \\( V \\)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that \"The smonk is vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
