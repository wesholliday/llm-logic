The first statement is: \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     - Where \\( A \\) is \"the smip must be lupped\"\n     - And \\( B \\) is \"the smip is shripped\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg A \\) means \"it is not the case that the smip must be lupped\"\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (the smip is shripped) from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n4. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism, if we have a disjunction \\( A \\lor B \\) and we know that \\( \\neg A \\) is true, we can infer \\( B \\).\n\n5. Applying this rule:\n   - From \\( A \\lor B \\) (either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped)\n   - And \\( \\neg A \\) (it is not the case that the smip must be lupped)\n   - We can infer \\( B \\) (the smip is shripped)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the rules of inference, we can conclude that \"The smip is shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
