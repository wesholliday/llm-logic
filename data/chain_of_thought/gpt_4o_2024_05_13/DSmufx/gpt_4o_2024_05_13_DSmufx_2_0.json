The first statement is: \"Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     - Where \\( A \\) is \"The wug must be bimmed.\"\n     - And \\( B \\) is \"The wug is flooped.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg A \\) means \"It is not the case that the wug must be bimmed.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (The wug is flooped) from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) is true)\n   - And we have \\( \\neg A \\) (it is not the case that \\( A \\) is true)\n   - Then we can conclude \\( B \\) (the other disjunct must be true).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\lor B \\) (Either the wug must be bimmed or it is flooped)\n- \\( \\neg A \\) (It is not the case that the wug must be bimmed)\n\nWe can infer:\n- \\( B \\) (The wug is flooped)\n\nAnswer: yes",
