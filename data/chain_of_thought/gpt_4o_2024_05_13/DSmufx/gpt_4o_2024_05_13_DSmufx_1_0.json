The first statement is: \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"the flugel must be zargled\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"the flugel is blimmed\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) means \"not P\" or \"the flugel must not be zargled\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( Q \\) (the flugel is blimmed) from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either P or Q is true)\n   - And we have \\( \\neg P \\) (P is not true)\n   - Then we can conclude \\( Q \\) (Q must be true)\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\lor Q \\) (Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed)\n- \\( \\neg P \\) (It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled)\n\nWe can infer:\n- \\( Q \\) (The flugel is blimmed)\n\nAnswer: yes",
