The first statement is: \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( T \\lor S \\)\n     where \\( T \\) represents \"the glip must be tragged\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the glip is slogged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg T \\)\n     where \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"it is not the case that the glip must be tragged.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (the glip is slogged) from these two statements.\n\n3. We have:\n   - \\( T \\lor S \\) (Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged)\n   - \\( \\neg T \\) (It is not the case that the glip must be tragged)\n\n4. In logic, if we have \\( T \\lor S \\) and \\( \\neg T \\), we can use the rule of disjunctive syllogism, which states that if one disjunct is false, the other must be true.\n\n5. Applying disjunctive syllogism:\n   - From \\( T \\lor S \\) and \\( \\neg T \\), we can infer \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
