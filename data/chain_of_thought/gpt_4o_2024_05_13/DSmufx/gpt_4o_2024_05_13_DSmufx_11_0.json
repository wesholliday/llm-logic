The first statement is: \"Either the flug must be zimmed or it is blummed.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( Z \\lor B \\)\n     - Where \\( Z \\) represents \"the flug must be zimmed\"\n     - And \\( B \\) represents \"the flug is blummed\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the flug must be zimmed.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg Z \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg Z \\) means \"not Z\" or \"the flug must not be zimmed\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (the flug is blummed) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement \\( Z \\lor B \\):\n   - This means that at least one of \\( Z \\) or \\( B \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement \\( \\neg Z \\):\n   - This means that \\( Z \\) is false.\n\n5. Given that \\( Z \\) is false, the only way for the first statement \\( Z \\lor B \\) to be true is if \\( B \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the statements, we can infer that \\( B \\) (the flug is blummed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
