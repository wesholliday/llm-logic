The first statement is: \"Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( G \\lor S \\)\n     where \\( G \\) represents \"the wug must be garpled\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the wug is sproinged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg G \\)\n     where \\( \\neg G \\) represents \"it is not the case that the wug must be garpled.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (the wug is sproinged) from \\( G \\lor S \\) and \\( \\neg G \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism, if we have a disjunction \\( G \\lor S \\) and we know that \\( \\neg G \\) is true, we can conclude \\( S \\).\n\nLet's apply this rule:\n- We have \\( G \\lor S \\) (either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged).\n- We also have \\( \\neg G \\) (it is not the case that the wug must be garpled).\n\nGiven \\( G \\lor S \\) and \\( \\neg G \\), we can conclude \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
