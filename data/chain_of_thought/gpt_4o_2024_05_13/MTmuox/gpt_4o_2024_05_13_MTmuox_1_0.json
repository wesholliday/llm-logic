The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the flugel must have been zargled.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The flugel was not necessarily zargled.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"It is not true that the flugel was zargled in all cases.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is a conditional statement: \"If B (blimmed), then Z (zargled).\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The flugel was not blimmed\" (\u00acB) from these statements.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- From the second statement, we know that B \u2192 Z (If the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled).\n- From the first statement, we know \u00ac(Z) (It is not necessarily the case that the flugel was zargled).\n\nTo infer \u00acB (The flugel was not blimmed), we need to see if the given information logically leads to this conclusion.\n\n- If the flugel was blimmed (B), then according to the second statement, it must have been zargled (Z).\n- However, the first statement tells us that it is not necessarily the case that the flugel was zargled (\u00ac(Z)).\n\nIf B were true, then Z would have to be true (from the second statement). But the first statement tells us that Z is not necessarily true. This creates a contradiction if B were true. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, B must be false.\n\nThus, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed (\u00acB).\n\nAnswer: yes",
