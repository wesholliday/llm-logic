The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nSince we have \u00acQ (the sneg must not have sproted the frink), and the contrapositive tells us that \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP, we can conclude \u00acP (the sneg was not crampled).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
