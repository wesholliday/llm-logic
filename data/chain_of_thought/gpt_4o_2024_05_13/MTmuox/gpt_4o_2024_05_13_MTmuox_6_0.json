The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The grommet did not necessarily plop the frink.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"It is not necessary that the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and Q is \"the grommet must have plopped the frink.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that it is not necessarily true that the grommet plopped the frink.\n- From the second statement, we know that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must be true that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nTo infer 'The grommet was not sploffed,' we need to show that the condition \"the grommet was sploffed\" leads to a contradiction with the information given.\n\n- Suppose the grommet was sploffed (P is true).\n- According to the second statement, if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink (Q must be true).\n- However, the first statement tells us that it is not necessarily true that the grommet plopped the frink (Q is not necessarily true).\n\nThis creates a contradiction because the second statement requires Q to be true if P is true, but the first statement allows for the possibility that Q is not true. Therefore, the assumption that the grommet was sploffed (P) must be false to avoid this contradiction.\n\nThus, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: no",
