The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"It is not necessary that the wug was garpled.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"It is not true that the wug was necessarily garpled.\"\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \u00ac\u25a1G (where G stands for \"the wug was garpled\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is a conditional statement: \"If S, then \u25a1G\" (where S stands for \"the wug was sproinged\").\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements to see if we can infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" (\u00acS).\n\n- From the second statement, we have: S \u2192 \u25a1G.\n- From the first statement, we have: \u00ac\u25a1G.\n\nTo infer \u00acS, we need to show that the assumption of S leads to a contradiction with the given information.\n\n- Assume S (the wug was sproinged).\n- From S \u2192 \u25a1G, if S is true, then \u25a1G must be true.\n- But we know from the first statement that \u00ac\u25a1G is true (it is not necessary that the wug was garpled).\n\nIf S were true, it would imply \u25a1G, which contradicts \u00ac\u25a1G. Therefore, S cannot be true.\n\nThus, we can infer \u00acS (the wug was not sproinged).\n\nAnswer: yes",
