The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"It is not necessary that the fleeg was surned.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"It is not true that the fleeg was necessarily surned.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is a conditional statement: \"If P (the fleeg was bluttered), then Q (the fleeg was surned).\"\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to see if we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\n- From the first statement, we know that it is not necessary that the fleeg was surned. This means that the fleeg being surned is not a certainty.\n- The second statement tells us that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\n\nTo infer that the fleeg was not bluttered, we need to show that the condition for the fleeg being bluttered leads to a contradiction with the first statement.\n\n- If the fleeg was bluttered (P), then according to the second statement, it must have been surned (Q).\n- However, the first statement tells us that it is not necessary that the fleeg was surned, which implies that the fleeg being surned is not a certainty.\n\nIf the fleeg being surned is not a certainty, then the condition that \"if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned\" cannot hold true unless the fleeg was not bluttered in the first place. Therefore, the only way to reconcile these statements is to conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
