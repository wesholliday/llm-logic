The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The flug must not have been zimmed.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is: \u00ac(Must(Zimmed(Flug)))\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is: Blummed(Flug) \u2192 Must(Zimmed(Flug))\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer 'The flug was not blummed' (\u00acBlummed(Flug)) from these statements.\n\nLet's consider the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- The contrapositive of \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed\" is: \"If the flug must not have been zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\"\n- In logical terms, this is: \u00ac(Must(Zimmed(Flug))) \u2192 \u00acBlummed(Flug)\n\nFrom the first statement, we have \u00ac(Must(Zimmed(Flug))).\n\nUsing the contrapositive of the second statement, we can substitute \u00ac(Must(Zimmed(Flug))) into the contrapositive:\n- \u00ac(Must(Zimmed(Flug))) \u2192 \u00acBlummed(Flug)\n\nSince we have \u00ac(Must(Zimmed(Flug))), we can conclude \u00acBlummed(Flug).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The flug was not blummed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
