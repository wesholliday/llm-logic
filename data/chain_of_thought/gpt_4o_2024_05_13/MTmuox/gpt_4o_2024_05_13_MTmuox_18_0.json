The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"The shank must not have been nugged\" or \"It is not necessary that the shank was nugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement: \"If P (the shank was plooked), then Q (the shank must have been nugged).\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from these statements.\n\nLet's denote:\n- P: The shank was plooked.\n- Q: The shank must have been nugged.\n\nThe second statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe first statement can be interpreted as: \u00acQ (It is not the case that Q).\n\nNow, we have:\n1. \u00acQ\n2. P \u2192 Q\n\nTo infer \u00acP (The shank was not plooked), we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), which is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nSince we have \u00acQ, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n- \u00acQ is true (from the first statement)\n\nTherefore, \u00acP must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
