In logical terms, W \u2192 B is equivalent to \u00acW \u2228 B. Therefore, \u00ac(W \u2192 B) is equivalent to \u00ac(\u00acW \u2228 B), which simplifies to W \u2227 \u00acB.\n\nSo, from \u00ac(W \u2192 B), we have:\n   - W (the wug was flooped)\n   - \u00acB (the wug did not bim the zoint)\n\nHowever, this seems to contradict the second statement, W \u2192 B, which states that if W (the wug was flooped), then B (the wug must have bimmed the zoint).\n\nGiven this contradiction, the only way to resolve it is to conclude that W (the wug was flooped) cannot be true. Therefore, we must have \u00acW (the wug was not flooped).\n\nAnswer: yes",
