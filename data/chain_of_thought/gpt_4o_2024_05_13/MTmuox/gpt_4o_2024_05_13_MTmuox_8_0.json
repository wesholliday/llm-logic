The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The sprocket was not necessarily daggled.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"\u00ac(D)\" where D represents \"the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is: \"C \u2192 D\" where C represents \"the sprocket was cranked.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" (\u00acC) from these statements.\n\nTo do this, we can use the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- The contrapositive of \"C \u2192 D\" is \"\u00acD \u2192 \u00acC.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we have \u00acD (the sprocket was not necessarily daggled).\n\nUsing the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- If \u00acD, then \u00acC.\n\nSince we have \u00acD from the first statement, we can infer \u00acC.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
