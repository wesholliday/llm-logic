The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \u00ac(Q), where Q represents \"the splat must have quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: M \u2192 Q, where M represents \"the splat was morphed.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acM (the splat was not morphed) from \u00acQ and M \u2192 Q.\n\n3. Let's use the contrapositive of the second statement (M \u2192 Q):\n   - The contrapositive of M \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acM.\n\n4. We know from the first statement that \u00acQ is true.\n\n5. Given \u00acQ and the contrapositive \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acM, we can infer \u00acM by modus ponens (if \u00acQ is true and \u00acQ implies \u00acM, then \u00acM must be true).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
