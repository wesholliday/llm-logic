The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"It is not necessary that the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"\u00ac(Must(Smip lupped the zoint))\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \"Shripped(Smip) \u2192 Must(Smip lupped the zoint)\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we have: \"\u00ac(Must(Smip lupped the zoint))\"\n- From the second statement, we have: \"Shripped(Smip) \u2192 Must(Smip lupped the zoint)\"\n\nTo infer 'The smip was not shripped', we need to show that \"\u00acShripped(Smip)\" is true.\n\nUsing the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- The contrapositive of \"Shripped(Smip) \u2192 Must(Smip lupped the zoint)\" is \"\u00acMust(Smip lupped the zoint) \u2192 \u00acShripped(Smip)\"\n\nWe already have \"\u00acMust(Smip lupped the zoint)\" from the first statement.\n\nTherefore, by applying the contrapositive, we can infer \"\u00acShripped(Smip)\".\n\nAnswer: yes",
