The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The clug was not necessarily snugged.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"\u00ac(S)\" where S represents \"The clug must have been snugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \"F \u2192 S\" where F represents \"The clug was fleeked.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The clug was not fleeked\" (\u00acF) from these statements.\n\n3. From the first statement, we have \u00acS.\n4. From the second statement, we have F \u2192 S.\n\nTo infer \u00acF, we can use the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- The contrapositive of \"F \u2192 S\" is \"\u00acS \u2192 \u00acF.\"\n\nSince we already have \u00acS from the first statement, we can use the contrapositive:\n- \u00acS \u2192 \u00acF\n- Given \u00acS, we can conclude \u00acF.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
