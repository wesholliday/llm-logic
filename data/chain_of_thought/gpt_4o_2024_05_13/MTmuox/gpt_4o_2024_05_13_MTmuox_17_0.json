The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the flob must have movated.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \u00ac(M), where M represents \"the flob must have movated.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob must have movated.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: S \u2192 M, where S represents \"the flob was skizzled.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acS (the flob was not skizzled) from these statements.\n\nLet's use the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- The contrapositive of S \u2192 M is \u00acM \u2192 \u00acS.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have \u00acM.\n- According to the contrapositive, if \u00acM is true, then \u00acS must also be true.\n\nSince we have \u00acM from the first statement, we can use the contrapositive of the second statement to conclude \u00acS.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
