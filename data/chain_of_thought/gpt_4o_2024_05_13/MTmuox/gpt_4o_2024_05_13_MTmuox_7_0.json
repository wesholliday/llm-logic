The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have tinked.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"The whiffle must not have tinked.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is: \u00ac(T), where T represents \"the whiffle must have tinked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is: S \u2192 T, where S represents \"the whiffle was shanked.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acS (the whiffle was not shanked) from these statements.\n\n3. From the first statement, we have \u00acT (the whiffle must not have tinked).\n\n4. From the second statement, we have S \u2192 T (if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked).\n\n5. To infer \u00acS from \u00acT and S \u2192 T, we can use the contrapositive of the implication S \u2192 T. The contrapositive of S \u2192 T is \u00acT \u2192 \u00acS.\n\n6. Since we have \u00acT (the whiffle must not have tinked) from the first statement, and \u00acT \u2192 \u00acS from the contrapositive of the second statement, we can apply modus ponens (a form of logical argument) to conclude \u00acS.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
