The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The dreb must not have been spened\" or \"It is not necessary that the dreb was spened.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement: \"If P (the dreb was vroombed), then Q (the dreb must have been spened).\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from these statements.\n\nLet's denote:\n- P: The dreb was vroombed.\n- Q: The dreb must have been spened.\n\nThe second statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe first statement can be written as: \u00acQ (It is not the case that Q).\n\nNow, we have:\n1. \u00acQ\n2. P \u2192 Q\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q). The contrapositive of P \u2192 Q is \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nSince we have \u00acQ (from the first statement), we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n- \u00acQ is true (given)\n- Therefore, \u00acP must be true.\n\nThus, \u00acP (The dreb was not vroombed) can be inferred.\n\nAnswer: yes",
