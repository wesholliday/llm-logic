The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the glip must have tragged.\"\n   - This can be rewritten as: \"The glip must not have tragged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \"If the glip was slogged (S), then the glip must have tragged (T).\"\n   - In logical notation: S \u2192 T\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The glip was not slogged\" (\u00acS) from these statements.\n\n3. From the first statement, we have: \u00acT (The glip must not have tragged).\n\n4. From the second statement, we have: S \u2192 T (If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged).\n\nTo infer \u00acS from S \u2192 T and \u00acT, we can use the contrapositive of the implication S \u2192 T. The contrapositive of S \u2192 T is \u00acT \u2192 \u00acS.\n\n5. Since we have \u00acT (The glip must not have tragged), and the contrapositive of S \u2192 T is \u00acT \u2192 \u00acS, we can conclude \u00acS (The glip was not slogged).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The glip was not slogged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
