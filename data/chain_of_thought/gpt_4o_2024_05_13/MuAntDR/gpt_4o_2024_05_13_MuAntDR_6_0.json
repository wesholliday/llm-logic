            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The concert must have been sold out or postponed\" presents two possible scenarios: either the concert was sold out, or it was postponed. This is an inclusive \"or,\" meaning at least one of the scenarios is true, but it does not specify which one. \n\nTo infer that \"The concert must have been postponed\" from the original statement, we would need additional information that rules out the possibility of the concert being sold out. Without such information, we cannot definitively conclude that the concert was postponed; it could just as well have been sold out.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer that the concert must have been postponed.\n\nAnswer: no",
