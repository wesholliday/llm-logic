To infer that \"The meeting must have been cancelled,\" we would need additional information that rules out the possibility of the meeting occurring at 2 PM. Without such information, we cannot definitively conclude that the meeting was cancelled, as it could have also taken place at 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: no",
