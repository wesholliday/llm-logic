            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday or extended\" presents two possible scenarios: either the project was completed by Friday, or it was extended. To infer that \"The project must have been extended,\" we would need to know that the project was not completed by Friday. Without additional information confirming that the project was not completed by Friday, we cannot definitively conclude that the project was extended. Therefore, the given statement alone does not provide enough information to infer that the project must have been extended.\n\nAnswer: no",
