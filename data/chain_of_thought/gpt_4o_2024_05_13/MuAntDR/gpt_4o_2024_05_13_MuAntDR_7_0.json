This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true, but it does not specify which one. \n\nTo infer that \"The exam must have been easy\" from the original statement, we would need additional information that rules out the possibility of the exam being difficult. Without such information, we cannot definitively conclude that the exam was easy; it could just as well have been difficult.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer that the exam must have been easy.\n\nAnswer: no",
