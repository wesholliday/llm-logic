The phrase \"eight characters long or longer\" includes the possibility of the password being exactly eight characters. \n\nTo infer that \"The password must have been longer than eight characters,\" we would be excluding the possibility of the password being exactly eight characters long, which contradicts the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the password must have been longer than eight characters from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
