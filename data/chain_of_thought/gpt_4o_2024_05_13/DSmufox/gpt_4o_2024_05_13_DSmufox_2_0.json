We have \u00ac(W), which means W is false.\n2. We also have (W \u2228 F), which means at least one of W or F must be true.\n3. Since W is false (from \u00ac(W)), the only way for (W \u2228 F) to be true is if F is true.\n\nTherefore, given that W is false and (W \u2228 F) must be true, F must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
