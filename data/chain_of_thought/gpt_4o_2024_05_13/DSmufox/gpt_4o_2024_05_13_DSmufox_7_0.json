The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the whiffle must be tinked.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The whiffle must not be tinked.\"\n   - In logical terms, if we let T represent \"the whiffle must be tinked,\" then this statement is \u00acT (not T).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked.\"\n   - In logical terms, if we let S represent \"the whiffle is shanked,\" then this statement is T \u2228 S (T or S).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer S (the whiffle is shanked) from \u00acT and T \u2228 S.\n\n3. We have \u00acT (the whiffle must not be tinked).\n4. We also have T \u2228 S (either the whiffle must be tinked or it is shanked).\n\nIn logical terms, if we know \u00acT and T \u2228 S, we can use the rule of disjunction elimination (also known as modus tollendo ponens):\n- From \u00acT, we know T is false.\n- Given T \u2228 S, if T is false, then S must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, from \u00acT and T \u2228 S, we can infer S.\n\nAnswer: yes",
