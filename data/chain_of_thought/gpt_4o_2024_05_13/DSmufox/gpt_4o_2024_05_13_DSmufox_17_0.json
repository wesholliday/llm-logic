The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the flob must be movated.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \u00acM (where M stands for \"the flob must be movated\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the flob must be movated or it is skizzled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: M \u2228 S (where S stands for \"the flob is skizzled\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer S (the flob is skizzled) from \u00acM and M \u2228 S.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \u00acM (the flob is not movated) and M \u2228 S (the flob must be movated or it is skizzled), we can use the disjunctive syllogism rule. This rule states that if one part of a disjunction (M \u2228 S) is false (\u00acM), then the other part must be true (S).\n\n4. Applying the disjunctive syllogism:\n   - We have \u00acM (the flob is not movated).\n   - We also have M \u2228 S (the flob must be movated or it is skizzled).\n   - Since \u00acM is true, M must be false.\n   - Therefore, if M is false, S must be true to satisfy the disjunction M \u2228 S.\n\nThus, we can infer that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
