The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"The grommet must not be plopped.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"The grommet must be plopped or the grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the grommet must not be plopped.\n- From the second statement, we know that one of the two conditions must be true: either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed.\n\nSince the grommet must not be plopped (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
