The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \u00ac(W \u2192 G), where W represents \"the wug\" and G represents \"garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the wug must be garpled or it is sproinged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: W \u2192 G \u2228 S, where S represents \"sproinged.\"\n\nNow, let's break down the logical implications:\n\n- The first statement \u00ac(W \u2192 G) means that it is not true that if the wug exists (W), then it must be garpled (G). In other words, the implication W \u2192 G is false.\n- An implication W \u2192 G is false if and only if W is true and G is false. This means that the wug exists (W is true) and it is not garpled (G is false).\n\nGiven that W is true and G is false, let's consider the second statement W \u2192 G \u2228 S:\n- Since W is true, the statement W \u2192 G \u2228 S simplifies to G \u2228 S.\n- We already know that G is false, so G \u2228 S simplifies to false \u2228 S, which is equivalent to S.\n\nTherefore, S must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
