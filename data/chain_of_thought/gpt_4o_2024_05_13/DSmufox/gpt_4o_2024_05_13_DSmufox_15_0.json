We know \u00acS (the dreb must not be spened).\n2. We also know S \u2228 V (either the dreb must be spened or it is vroombed).\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (S \u2228 V) and we know that one of the disjuncts (S) is false (\u00acS), then the other disjunct (V) must be true. This is because for a disjunction to be true, at least one of the disjuncts must be true.\n\nSince \u00acS is true, S is false. Therefore, for the disjunction S \u2228 V to hold true, V must be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that V (the dreb is vroombed) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
