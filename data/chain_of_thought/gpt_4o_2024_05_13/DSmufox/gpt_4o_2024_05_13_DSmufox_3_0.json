The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00ac(Splat must be quanked).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed.\"\n   - This can be written as: (Splat must be quanked) \u2228 (Splat is morphed).\n\nNow, let's use these statements to see if we can infer 'The splat is morphed'.\n\n- From the first statement, \u00ac(Splat must be quanked), we know that the splat must not be quanked.\n- The second statement is a disjunction: (Splat must be quanked) \u2228 (Splat is morphed).\n\nIn a disjunction (A \u2228 B), if one part (A) is false, then the other part (B) must be true for the whole statement to be true.\n\n- We have \u00ac(Splat must be quanked), which means (Splat must be quanked) is false.\n- Therefore, for the disjunction (Splat must be quanked) \u2228 (Splat is morphed) to hold true, (Splat is morphed) must be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that 'The splat is morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
