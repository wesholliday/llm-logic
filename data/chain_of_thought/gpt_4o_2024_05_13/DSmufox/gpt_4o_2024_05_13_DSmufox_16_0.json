The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the sneg must be sproted.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \u00acP, where P represents \"the sneg must be sproted.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: P \u2228 Q, where Q represents \"the sneg is crampled.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer Q (the sneg is crampled) from \u00acP and P \u2228 Q.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \u00acP (not P) and P \u2228 Q (P or Q), we can use the disjunctive syllogism rule:\n   - Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \u00acP and P \u2228 Q, then Q must be true.\n\n4. Applying this rule:\n   - We have \u00acP (the sneg must not be sproted).\n   - We also have P \u2228 Q (either the sneg must be sproted or it is crampled).\n   - Since \u00acP is true, P cannot be true.\n   - Therefore, Q must be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The sneg is crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
