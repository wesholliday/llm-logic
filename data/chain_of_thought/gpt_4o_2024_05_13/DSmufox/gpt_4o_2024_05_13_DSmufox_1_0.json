The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \u00ac(F \u2192 Z), where F represents \"the flugel\" and Z represents \"zargled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the flugel must be zargled or it is blimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: F \u2192 Z \u2228 B, where B represents \"blimmed.\"\n\nNow, let's break down the logical implications:\n\n- The first statement \u00ac(F \u2192 Z) means that it is not true that if the flugel exists, it must be zargled. In logical terms, F \u2192 Z is equivalent to \u00acF \u2228 Z. Therefore, \u00ac(F \u2192 Z) is equivalent to \u00ac(\u00acF \u2228 Z), which simplifies to F \u2227 \u00acZ. This means that the flugel exists (F is true) and it is not zargled (Z is false).\n\n- The second statement F \u2192 Z \u2228 B means that if the flugel exists, then it must be either zargled or blimmed. Since we already know from the first statement that F is true and Z is false, we can substitute these values into the second statement.\n\nGiven F is true and Z is false, the second statement becomes:\n  - True \u2192 False \u2228 B\n  - True \u2192 B (since False \u2228 B simplifies to B)\n\nSince the implication True \u2192 B must hold, B must be true. Therefore, the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
