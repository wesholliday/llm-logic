The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the smip must be lupped.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The smip does not have to be lupped.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"It is not necessary that the smip is lupped.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the smip must be lupped or it is shripped.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The smip is either lupped or shripped.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is an inclusive disjunction: \"The smip is lupped or the smip is shripped.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that it is not necessary for the smip to be lupped.\n- From the second statement, we know that if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped (since one of the two conditions must hold true).\n\nSince the first statement tells us that the smip does not have to be lupped, we can conclude that the smip is not necessarily lupped. Given the second statement, if the smip is not lupped, then it must be shripped.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
