We have \u00acS, which means \"the zinger must not be smoogled.\"\n2. We also have S \u2228 F, which means \"either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled.\"\n\nGiven \u00acS (the zinger must not be smoogled), the disjunction S \u2228 F (either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled) simplifies to F because S is false.\n\nTherefore, from \u00acS and S \u2228 F, we can infer F.\n\nAnswer: yes",
