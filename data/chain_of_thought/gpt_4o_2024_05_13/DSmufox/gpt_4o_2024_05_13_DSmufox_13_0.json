The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \u00acT (where T represents \"the glip must be tragged\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the glip must be tragged or it is slogged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: T \u2228 S (where S represents \"the glip is slogged\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer S (the glip is slogged) from \u00acT and T \u2228 S.\n\n3. From \u00acT, we know that T is false.\n   - Therefore, T \u2228 S simplifies to false \u2228 S.\n\n4. In logic, false \u2228 S simplifies to S because anything ORed with false is just the other term.\n\nSince we have determined that S must be true based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
