We know \u00acN (the shank must not be nugged).\n2. We also know N \u2228 P (either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked).\n\nGiven \u00acN, the first part of the disjunction (N \u2228 P) is false. Therefore, for the disjunction to be true, the second part (P) must be true.\n\nThus, from \u00acN and N \u2228 P, we can infer P.\n\nAnswer: yes",
