The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n   - This can be written as: If G (griffin in the forest), then U (unicorn in the forest).\n   - Symbolically: G \u2192 U\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The griffin was in the forest.\"\n   - This can be written as: G\n\n3. We need to determine if the unicorn was in the forest based on the given information.\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference:\n- From the conditional statement G \u2192 U and the fact G, we can apply Modus Ponens.\n- Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nApplying Modus Ponens to our statements:\n- We have G \u2192 U (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest).\n- We also have G (The griffin was in the forest).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude U (The unicorn was in the forest).\n\nAnswer: yes",
