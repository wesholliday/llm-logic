The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n   - This can be written as: If \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park), then \\( Z \\) (Lucy went to the zoo).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Joe went to the park.\"\n   - This means \\( P \\) is true.\n\nGiven the conditional statement (If \\( P \\), then \\( Z \\)) and the fact that \\( P \\) is true, we can apply the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if \\( P \\) implies \\( Z \\) and \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Z \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since Joe went to the park (\\( P \\) is true), we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo (\\( Z \\) is true).\n\nAnswer: yes",
