            "content": "To determine if we can infer that Jen watched basketball, let's break down the information given and apply logical reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   - This can be written as: If \\( T \\) (Tom watched football), then \\( J \\) (Jen watched basketball).\n   - Symbolically, this is \\( T \\rightarrow J \\).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Tom watched football.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( T \\).\n\n3. We need to determine if Jen watched basketball based on the given information.\n\nUsing the rules of logic:\n- From the conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and the fact \\( T \\) is true, we can apply Modus Ponens.\n- Modus Ponens states that if \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is true and \\( T \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
