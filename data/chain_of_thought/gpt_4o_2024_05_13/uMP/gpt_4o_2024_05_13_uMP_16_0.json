            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the pants were denim, let's break down the given information step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical terms as: \n   - If \\( S \\) (shirt is cotton), then \\( P \\) (pants are denim).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The shirt was cotton.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( S \\) is true.\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer that the pants were denim (\\( P \\)).\n\nGiven the conditional statement \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) and the fact that \\( S \\) is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) is true and \\( S \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since the shirt was cotton (\\( S \\) is true) and the conditional statement tells us that if the shirt is cotton then the pants are denim (\\( S \\rightarrow P \\)), we can infer that the pants were denim (\\( P \\)).\n\nAnswer: yes",
