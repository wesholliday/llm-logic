The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If B (bear in the cave), then W (wolf in the den).\n\n2. The second statement is a factual statement: \"The bear was in the cave.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - B (bear in the cave).\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer that the wolf was in the den (W).\n\nGiven the conditional statement (If B, then W) and the fact that B is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nApplying modus ponens to our statements:\n- If B, then W (conditional statement)\n- B (bear in the cave)\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n- W (wolf in the den)\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can conclude that the wolf was in the den.\n\nAnswer: yes",
