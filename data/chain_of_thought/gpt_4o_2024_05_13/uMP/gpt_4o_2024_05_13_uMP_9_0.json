The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be written as: If \\( L \\) (Lisa bought the red shirt), then \\( M \\) (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n   - Symbolically, this is \\( L \\rightarrow M \\).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( L \\).\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( M \\) (Mark bought the blue shirt) from these statements.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n- \\( L \\)\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and we know that \\( L \\) is true, then we can conclude that \\( M \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
