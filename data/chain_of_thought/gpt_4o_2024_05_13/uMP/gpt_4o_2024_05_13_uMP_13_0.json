            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the truck was blue, let's break down the given statements and analyze them step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\text{Car is red} \\rightarrow \\text{Truck is blue} \\).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The car was red.\"\n   - This confirms the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can apply the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) (if p then q) and \\( p \\) (p is true), then \\( q \\) (q must also be true).\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( p \\) is \"The car was red.\"\n- \\( q \\) is \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nSince both \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) and \\( p \\) are true, we can conclude \\( q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
