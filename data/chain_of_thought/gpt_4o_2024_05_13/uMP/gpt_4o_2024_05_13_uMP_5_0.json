The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball), then \\( A \\) (Amy played tennis).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jeff played basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( J \\) is true.\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer that \\( A \\) (Amy played tennis) is true based on the given information.\n\nGiven the conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis) and the fact that \\( J \\) is true (Jeff played basketball), we can use the rule of modus ponens in logic. Modus ponens states that if \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is true and \\( J \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
