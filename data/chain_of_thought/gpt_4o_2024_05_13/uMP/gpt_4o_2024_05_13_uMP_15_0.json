The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sam took a plane.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if \\( Q \\) (Erin took a train) can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know that \\( P \\) is true, then we can conclude that \\( Q \\) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( P \\)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- \\( Q \\)\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: yes",
