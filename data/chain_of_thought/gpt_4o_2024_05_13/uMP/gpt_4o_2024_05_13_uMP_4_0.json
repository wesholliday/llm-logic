The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If A, then B (where A is \"the alien visited Mars\" and B is \"the robot visited Jupiter\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The alien visited Mars.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - A (the alien visited Mars).\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer B (the robot visited Jupiter) from the given statements.\n\nGiven the conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and the fact that A is true, we can use the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if \"If A, then B\" is true and A is true, then B must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since we have:\n- If A, then B (If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter)\n- A (the alien visited Mars)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- B (the robot visited Jupiter)\n\nAnswer: yes",
