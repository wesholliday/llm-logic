The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical terms as: \n   - If P (Sue chose pizza), then Q (Bob chose pasta).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue chose pizza.\" This can be written as:\n   - P (Sue chose pizza).\n\nGiven these two statements, we need to determine if we can infer Q (Bob chose pasta).\n\nIn logical terms, if we have:\n- P \u2192 Q (If P then Q)\n- P (P is true)\n\nFrom these two premises, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if \"P \u2192 Q\" and \"P\" are both true, then \"Q\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Bob chose pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
