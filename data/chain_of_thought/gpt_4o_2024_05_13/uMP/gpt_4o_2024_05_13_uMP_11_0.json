The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( C \\rightarrow B \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cake was chocolate.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( C \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer that the muffins were blueberry (\\( B \\)).\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference, specifically Modus Ponens, which states that if \\( C \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( C \\) are both true, then \\( B \\) must also be true, we can proceed as follows:\n\n- We have \\( C \\rightarrow B \\) (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry).\n- We also have \\( C \\) (The cake was chocolate).\n\nBy Modus Ponens:\n- Since \\( C \\) is true and \\( C \\rightarrow B \\) is true, it follows that \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes",
