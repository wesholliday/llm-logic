The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The doll was plastic) can be deduced from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot deduce \\( P \\). This is because \\( Q \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true; \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\).\n\nFor example, the truck could be metal regardless of whether the doll is plastic or not. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the doll is plastic, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that the doll was plastic based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
