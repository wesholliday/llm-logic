The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( J \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( T \\) (Tom watched football) can be logically deduced from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) means that if \\( T \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( T \\) if \\( J \\) is true. The truth of \\( J \\) alone does not imply the truth of \\( T \\); it only confirms that the condition \\( J \\) is met, which could happen regardless of whether \\( T \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and \"Jen watched basketball,\" we cannot logically deduce that \"Tom watched football.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
