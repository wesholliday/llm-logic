This is because \\( Q \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true; \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\).\n\nFor example, Bob could have chosen pasta regardless of whether Sue chose pizza or not. The implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true, but it does not tell us that \\( P \\) must be true if \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that Sue chose pizza based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
