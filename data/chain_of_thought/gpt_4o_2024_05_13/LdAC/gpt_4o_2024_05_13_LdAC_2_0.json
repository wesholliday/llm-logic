The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n   where \\( G \\) represents \"The griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( U \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can deduce \\( G \\) (The griffin was in the forest) from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we are given:\n   \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n   \\( U \\)\n\nTo deduce \\( G \\) from these, we need to check if the given information logically leads to \\( G \\).\n\nHowever, the conditional statement \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) only tells us what happens if \\( G \\) is true. It does not provide any information about what happens if \\( U \\) is true. The fact that \\( U \\) is true does not necessarily mean that \\( G \\) must be true. \\( U \\) could be true for reasons unrelated to \\( G \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce \\( G \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
