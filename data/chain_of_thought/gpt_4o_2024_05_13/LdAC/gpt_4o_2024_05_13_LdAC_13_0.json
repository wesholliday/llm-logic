It does not tell us anything about the car if the truck is blue. The truck being blue could be true regardless of the color of the car. \n\nIn logical terms, \\( \\text{Red(car)} \\rightarrow \\text{Blue(truck)} \\) does not imply \\( \\text{Blue(truck)} \\rightarrow \\text{Red(car)} \\). The latter would be the converse of the original statement, and the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot logically deduce that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: no",
