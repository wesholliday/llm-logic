The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"The apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( B \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( A \\) (The apple was red) can be deduced from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\), we cannot deduce \\( A \\). This is because \\( B \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( A \\) is true; \\( B \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( A \\) being true.\n\nFor example, the banana could be yellow regardless of the color of the apple. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the apple is red, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that the apple was red based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
