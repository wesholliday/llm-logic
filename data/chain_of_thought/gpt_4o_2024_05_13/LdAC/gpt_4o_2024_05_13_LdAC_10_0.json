The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( D \\) represents \"The dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"The cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cat was outside.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( C \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can deduce \\( D \\) (The dog was inside) from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we are given:\n   \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n   \\( C \\)\n\nTo deduce \\( D \\), we need to check if \\( C \\) implies \\( D \\). However, the conditional statement \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) only tells us that if \\( D \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be true. It does not tell us what happens if \\( C \\) is true. \\( C \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( D \\) is true; \\( C \\) could be true regardless of \\( D \\).\n\nTherefore, from \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( C \\), we cannot logically deduce \\( D \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
