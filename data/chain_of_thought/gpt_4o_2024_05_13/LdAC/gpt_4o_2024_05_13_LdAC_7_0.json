It does not provide any information about what happens if \\( C \\) is true. \\( C \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( A \\) must be true. \\( C \\) could be true regardless of \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, from \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( C \\), we cannot logically deduce \\( A \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
