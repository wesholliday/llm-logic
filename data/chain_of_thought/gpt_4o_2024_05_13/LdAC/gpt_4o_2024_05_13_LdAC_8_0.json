The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( V \\) represents \"The vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( V \\) (The vampire was awake) can be logically deduced from these statements.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) tells us that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true.\n- The statement \\( M \\) tells us that the mummy was awake.\n\nHowever, knowing that \\( M \\) is true does not provide any information about whether \\( V \\) is true or false. The conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) does not imply that \\( M \\rightarrow V \\) (the converse) is true. Therefore, \\( M \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( V \\) is true.\n\nThus, we cannot logically deduce that \"The vampire was awake\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
