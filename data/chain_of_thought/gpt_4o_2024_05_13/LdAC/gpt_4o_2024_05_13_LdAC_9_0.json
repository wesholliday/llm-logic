The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( L \\) (Lisa bought the red shirt) can be deduced from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\), we cannot deduce \\( L \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) only tells us what happens if \\( L \\) is true, but it does not provide any information about what happens if \\( M \\) is true. \\( M \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( L \\) is true; \\( M \\) could be true for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
