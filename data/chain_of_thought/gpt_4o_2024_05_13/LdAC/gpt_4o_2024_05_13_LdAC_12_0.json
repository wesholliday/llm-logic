The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Z \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park) can be logically deduced from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) means that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Z \\) must also be true. However, it does not imply that if \\( Z \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be true. \\( Z \\) being true only tells us that the condition \\( P \\) could be true or false; it does not provide enough information to conclude \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" and \"Lucy went to the zoo,\" we cannot logically deduce that \"Joe went to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
