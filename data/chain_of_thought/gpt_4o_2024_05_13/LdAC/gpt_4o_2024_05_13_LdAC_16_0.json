The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( S \\rightarrow P \\)\n   where \\( S \\) represents \"The shirt was cotton\" and \\( P \\) represents \"The pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( S \\) (The shirt was cotton) can be logically deduced from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( P \\), we cannot deduce \\( S \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) only tells us what happens if \\( S \\) is true, but it does not provide any information about what happens if \\( P \\) is true. \\( P \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( S \\) is true; \\( P \\) could be true for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that the shirt was cotton just because the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: no",
