We are given the statement: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor\"\n\n2. We are also given the statement: \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box, which is \\( P \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism, we know that if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can conclude \\( P \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe can infer:\n- \\( P \\)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical reasoning, we can conclude that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
