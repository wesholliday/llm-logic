According to this rule, if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), then \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n- From \\( A \\lor B \\), we know that at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) is true.\n- From \\( \\neg B \\), we know that \\( B \\) is false.\n- Since \\( B \\) is false, the only way for \\( A \\lor B \\) to be true is if \\( A \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes",
