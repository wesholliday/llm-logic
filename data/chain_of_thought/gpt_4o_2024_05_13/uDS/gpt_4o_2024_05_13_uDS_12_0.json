Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\n2. The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have two possibilities:\n- The jacket is draped over the chair.\n- The jacket is hanging in the closet.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the jacket isn't hanging in the closet. This eliminates the second possibility.\n\nSince the only remaining possibility is that the jacket is draped over the chair, we can infer that the jacket is indeed draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
