The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have two possibilities:\n- The sunglasses are in her bag.\n- The sunglasses are perched on her head.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the sunglasses are not perched on her head. This eliminates the second possibility.\n\nSince the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the sunglasses are in her bag, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
