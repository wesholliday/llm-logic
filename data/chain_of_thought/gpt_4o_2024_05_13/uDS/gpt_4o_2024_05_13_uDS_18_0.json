Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\n2. The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have two possibilities:\n- The notebook is in the drawer.\n- The notebook is sitting on the nightstand.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the notebook is not on the nightstand. This eliminates the second possibility from the first statement.\n\nSince the only remaining possibility is that the notebook is in the drawer, we can infer that the notebook is indeed in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
