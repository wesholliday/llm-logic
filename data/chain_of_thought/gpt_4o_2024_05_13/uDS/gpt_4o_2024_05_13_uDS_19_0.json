We have a statement that says: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\) or \\( B \\), where \\( A \\) is \"the watch is charging on the dresser\" and \\( B \\) is \"the watch is on his wrist.\"\n\n2. We also have another statement: \"The watch isn't on his wrist.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg B \\), where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"the watch is not on his wrist.\"\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we need to determine if we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser (\\( A \\)).\n\n3. According to the logical rule of disjunction (OR), if one part of the disjunction is false, the other part must be true for the entire statement to hold true.\n   - Since \\( B \\) (the watch is on his wrist) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), the only way for the statement \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) to be true is if \\( A \\) (the watch is charging on the dresser) is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
