Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed.\n2. The missing sock isn't under the bed.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have two possibilities:\n- The sock is in the laundry basket.\n- The sock is under the bed.\n\nThe second statement tells us that the sock is not under the bed. This eliminates the second possibility.\n\nSince the sock is not under the bed, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
