The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet\" can be represented logically as:\n   \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) is \"the keys are in the drawer\" and \\( B \\) is \"the keys are dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\n2. The statement \"the keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" can be represented logically as:\n   \\( \\neg B \\)\n   where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"the keys are not dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\n3. We need to determine if \\( A \\) (the keys are in the drawer) can be inferred from the given information.\n\nGiven:\n\\( A \\lor B \\) (Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet)\n\\( \\neg B \\) (The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet)\n\nUsing the rule of disjunction elimination (if \\( A \\lor B \\) is true and \\( \\neg B \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must be true):\nSince \\( B \\) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), the only way for \\( A \\lor B \\) to be true is if \\( A \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \\( A \\) (the keys are in the drawer) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
