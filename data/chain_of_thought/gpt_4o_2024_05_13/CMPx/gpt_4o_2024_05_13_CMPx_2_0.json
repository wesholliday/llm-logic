    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "To determine if it is likely that the sulect will get the zulision if the jantiz doesn't, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. The jantiz is the most qualified applicant.\n2. The cramen is the second most qualified applicant.\n3. The sulect is the least qualified applicant.\n4. If the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will.\n5. The jantiz is likely to get the zulision, and hence the cramen is likely not to get it.\n\nFrom point 4, we understand that if the cramen does not get the zulision, and the jantiz also does not get it, then the sulect will get it. This implies that the sulect is the fallback option if both the jantiz and the cramen are not chosen.\n\nFrom point 5, we know that the jantiz is likely to get the zulision. However, we need to consider the scenario where the jantiz does not get it. If the jantiz does not get the zulision, the next in line based on qualifications is the cramen. Therefore, if the jantiz does not get the zulision, it is more likely that the cramen will get it because the cramen is the second most qualified applicant.\n\nGiven that the cramen is the second most qualified, the likelihood of the sulect getting the zulision only comes into play if both the jantiz and the cramen do not get it. Since the cramen is more qualified than the sulect, it is less likely that the sulect will get the zulision if the jantiz does not get it, because the cramen would be the next likely choice.\n\nTherefore, it does not follow that it is likely that the sulect will get the zulision if the jantiz does not get it, because the cramen is the more likely candidate in that scenario.\n\nAnswer: no",
