    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fraglen, a darpil, and a votal are the top bispil teams this season. The fraglen is expected to have the best record, followed by the darpil, while the votal trails far behind. These lead the league, so if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will. Moreover, the fraglen likely will lead the league and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fraglen doesn\u2019t lead the league, the votal will?",

            "content": "To determine if it is likely that the votal will lead the league if the fraglen does not, let's break down the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Team Rankings and Expectations:**\n   - The fraglen is expected to have the best record.\n   - The darpil is expected to have the second-best record.\n   - The votal is expected to trail far behind the fraglen and the darpil.\n\n2. **Conditional Statements:**\n   - If the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will.\n   - The fraglen likely will lead the league, and hence the darpil likely won\u2019t.\n\n3. **Implications:**\n   - The fraglen is likely to lead the league, which implies that the darpil is less likely to lead the league.\n   - If the fraglen does not lead the league, we need to consider the likelihood of the votal leading the league.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Conditional Statement:**\n   - The statement \"if the darpil doesn\u2019t have the top record, then if the fraglen doesn\u2019t, the votal will\" can be broken down:\n     - If the darpil does not have the top record, and the fraglen also does not have the top record, then the votal will have the top record.\n\n5. **Likelihood Analysis:**\n   - Since the fraglen is likely to lead the league, the scenario where the fraglen does not lead is less likely.\n   - If the fraglen does not lead, the darpil is the next expected team to lead, but the statement suggests that if the darpil also does not lead, then the votal will.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given that the fraglen is likely to lead, the scenario where the fraglen does not lead is already less likely.\n   - In the less likely scenario where the fraglen does not lead, the conditional statement tells us that the votal will lead if the darpil also does not lead.\n   - Therefore, it is likely that if the fraglen does not lead, the votal will lead, based on the given conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
