This means that at least one of these two entities must have given their approval.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO\" essentially breaks down the original statement into two separate conditions, but it maintains the same logical structure. It still means that the contract needs approval from at least one of the two entities.\n\nTherefore, the rephrased statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
