This can be interpreted as the candidate needing at least one of the two qualifications: a degree or relevant work experience.\n\nThe rephrased statement \"The candidate must have had a degree or they must have had relevant work experience\" essentially conveys the same requirement. It states that the candidate must have one of the two qualifications, either a degree or relevant work experience.\n\nBoth statements are logically equivalent because they both require the candidate to have at least one of the two qualifications. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
