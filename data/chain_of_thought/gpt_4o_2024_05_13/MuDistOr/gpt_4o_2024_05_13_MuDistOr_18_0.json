This means that the product must satisfy at least one of the two conditions: being eco-friendly or being recyclable.\n\nThe inferred statement is: 'The product must have been eco-friendly or it must have been recyclable'. This statement is essentially a restatement of the original statement, but with a slight rephrasing.
