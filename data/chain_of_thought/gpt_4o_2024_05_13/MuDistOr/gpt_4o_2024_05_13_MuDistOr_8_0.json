            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized' from 'The document must have been signed or notarized', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\nThe original statement 'The document must have been signed or notarized' implies that at least one of the two conditions (signed or notarized) must be true for the document. This means that the document could be signed, notarized, or both.\n\nThe inferred statement 'The document must have been signed or it must have been notarized' is essentially restating the same condition: that at least one of the two conditions must be true. It does not change the meaning or add any new conditions.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement logically follows from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
