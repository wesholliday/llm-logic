            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The software must have been installed on the computer or accessed through the cloud\" presents two possibilities for how the software could be used: either it was installed on the computer, or it was accessed through the cloud. The rephrased statement \"The software must have been installed on the computer or it must have been accessed through the cloud\" essentially conveys the same two possibilities but makes the structure more explicit by repeating \"it must have been.\" Both statements indicate that at least one of the two conditions must be true for the software to be used. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
