'The flugel might not have been blimmed' suggests that there is a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed. This means that it is not certain whether the flugel was blimmed or not; it could go either way.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed' means that it is not necessary for the flugel to have been blimmed. In other words, there is no requirement or certainty that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement indicates a possibility (the flugel might not have been blimmed).\n- The second statement indicates a lack of necessity (the flugel does not have to have been blimmed).\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility that the flugel was not blimmed, it aligns with the idea that it is not necessary for the flugel to have been blimmed. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
