'The grommet might not have been sploffed' suggests that there is a possibility that the grommet was not sploffed. This means that it is not certain whether the grommet was sploffed or not; it could go either way.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed' means that it is not necessary or certain that the grommet was sploffed. This statement allows for the possibility that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nGiven that 'The grommet might not have been sploffed' indicates uncertainty and allows for the possibility that the grommet was not sploffed, it aligns with the idea that it is not certain or necessary that the grommet was sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed' from 'The grommet might not have been sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
