'The clug might not have been fleeked' suggests that there is a possibility that the clug was not fleeked. This means that it is not certain whether the clug was fleeked or not; it could go either way.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked' means that it is not necessary for the clug to have been fleeked. In other words, there is no requirement or certainty that the clug was fleeked.\n\nGiven that 'The clug might not have been fleeked' indicates uncertainty and allows for the possibility that the clug was not fleeked, it aligns with the idea that it is not necessary for the clug to have been fleeked. Therefore, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
