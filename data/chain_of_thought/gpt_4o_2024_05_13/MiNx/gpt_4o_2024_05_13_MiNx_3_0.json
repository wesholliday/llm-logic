'The splat might not have been morphed' suggests that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed. This means that it is not certain whether the splat was morphed or not; it could go either way.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' means that it is not necessary or certain that the splat was morphed. This implies that there is no requirement or absolute certainty that the splat was morphed.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement ('The splat might not have been morphed') indicates uncertainty about the splat being morphed.\n- The second statement ('It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed') also indicates that there is no necessity or certainty about the splat being morphed.\n\nSince both statements convey a lack of certainty or necessity regarding the splat being morphed, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
