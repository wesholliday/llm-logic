'The shank might not have been plooked':\n   - This means there is a possibility that the shank was not plooked. It does not definitively state that the shank was not plooked, only that it is possible it wasn't.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked':\n   - This means it is not necessarily true that the shank was plooked. In other words, it is not a requirement or certainty that the shank was plooked.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement ('The shank might not have been plooked') suggests that there is a possibility that the shank was not plooked.\n- The second statement ('It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked') suggests that it is not certain or required that the shank was plooked.\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility that the shank was not plooked, it aligns with the idea that it is not necessarily true that the shank was plooked. Therefore, the first statement supports the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
