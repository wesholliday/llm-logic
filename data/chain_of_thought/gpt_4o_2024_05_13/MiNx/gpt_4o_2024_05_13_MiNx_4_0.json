'The fribble might not have been snurgled' suggests that it is possible that the fribble was not snurgled. This means there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled, but it does not definitively state that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled' means that it is not necessary or certain that the fribble was snurgled. This implies that there is no requirement or certainty that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement indicates a possibility (the fribble might not have been snurgled).\n- The second statement indicates a lack of necessity or certainty (the fribble must not have been snurgled).\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility that the fribble was not snurgled, it aligns with the idea that it is not necessary or certain that the fribble was snurgled. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
