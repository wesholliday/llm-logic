'The dreb might not have been vroombed':\n   - This suggests that there is a possibility that the dreb was not vroombed. It does not definitively state that the dreb was not vroombed, only that it is possible.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed':\n   - This means that it is not necessary or certain that the dreb was vroombed. There is no requirement or certainty that the dreb was vroombed.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- If 'The dreb might not have been vroombed', it implies that there is a possibility that the dreb was not vroombed. This aligns with the idea that it is not certain or necessary that the dreb was vroombed.\n- Therefore, if there is a possibility that the dreb was not vroombed, it logically follows that it is not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed.\n\nThus, we can infer 'It's not the case that the dreb must have been vroombed' from 'The dreb might not have been vroombed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
