'The fleeg might not have been bluttered':\n   - This means there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n   - It does not definitively state that the fleeg was not bluttered, only that it is possible.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered':\n   - This means it is not necessary that the fleeg was bluttered.\n   - In other words, there is no requirement or certainty that the fleeg was bluttered.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- If 'The fleeg might not have been bluttered', it implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n- If there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered, then it cannot be the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered (because 'must' implies certainty).\n\nTherefore, the first statement ('The fleeg might not have been bluttered') logically supports the second statement ('It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered').\n\nAnswer: yes",
