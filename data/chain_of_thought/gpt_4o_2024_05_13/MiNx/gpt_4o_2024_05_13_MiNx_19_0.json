'The smonk might not have been vreebled' suggests that there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled. This means that it is not certain whether the smonk was vreebled or not; it could go either way.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled' means that it is not necessary or certain that the smonk was vreebled. This statement allows for the possibility that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nGiven that 'The smonk might not have been vreebled' indicates uncertainty and allows for the possibility that the smonk was not vreebled, it aligns with the idea that it is not necessary or certain that the smonk was vreebled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled' from 'The smonk might not have been vreebled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
