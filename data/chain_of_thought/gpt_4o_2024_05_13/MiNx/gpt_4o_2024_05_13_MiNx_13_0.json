'The glip might not have been slogged':\n   - This means there is a possibility that the glip was not slogged. It does not definitively state that the glip was not slogged, only that it is possible.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the glip must have been slogged':\n   - This means it is not necessarily true that the glip was slogged. In other words, it is not a requirement or certainty that the glip was slogged.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement suggests a possibility (the glip might not have been slogged).\n- The second statement denies a necessity (it is not required that the glip was slogged).\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility that the glip was not slogged, it aligns with the idea that it is not a certainty that the glip was slogged. Therefore, the first statement supports the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
