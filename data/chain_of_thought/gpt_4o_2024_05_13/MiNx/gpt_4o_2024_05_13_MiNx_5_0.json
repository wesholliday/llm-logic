'The zinger might not have been fraggled' suggests that there is a possibility that the zinger was not fraggled. This means that it is not certain whether the zinger was fraggled or not; it could go either way.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled' means that it is not necessary for the zinger to have been fraggled. In other words, there is no requirement or certainty that the zinger was fraggled.\n\nGiven that 'The zinger might not have been fraggled' indicates a lack of certainty about the zinger being fraggled, it aligns with the idea that it is not necessary for the zinger to have been fraggled. Therefore, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
