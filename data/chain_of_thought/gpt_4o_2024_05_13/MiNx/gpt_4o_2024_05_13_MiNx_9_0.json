'The twonk might not have been plinked' suggests that there is a possibility that the twonk was not plinked. This means that it is not certain whether the twonk was plinked or not; it could go either way.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked' means that it is not necessary or required that the twonk was plinked. In other words, there is no certainty that the twonk was plinked.\n\nGiven that 'The twonk might not have been plinked' indicates uncertainty about whether the twonk was plinked, it aligns with the idea that it is not necessary for the twonk to have been plinked. Therefore, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
