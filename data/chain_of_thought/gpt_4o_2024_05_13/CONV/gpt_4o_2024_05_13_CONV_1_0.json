            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - This means that if Mary (M) was at the wedding, then Sue (S) was also at the wedding.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow M \\)\n\nTo determine if \\( S \\rightarrow M \\) can be inferred from \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), we need to consider the logical relationship between these two statements.\n\n- \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) does not imply \\( S \\rightarrow M \\). In logic, the implication \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) only tells us that whenever Mary is at the wedding, Sue must also be there. It does not provide any information about what happens if Sue is at the wedding.\n\n- The converse of an implication (i.e., \\( S \\rightarrow M \\)) is not necessarily true just because the original implication (\\( M \\rightarrow S \\)) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: no",
