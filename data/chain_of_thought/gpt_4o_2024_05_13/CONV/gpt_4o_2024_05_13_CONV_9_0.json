            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   - Where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow L \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) does not necessarily imply \\( M \\rightarrow L \\). The original statement is a conditional statement, and its converse (reversing the direction of the implication) is not automatically true.\n\n4. To illustrate this with an example:\n   - Suppose \\( L \\) is true (Lisa bought the red shirt), then \\( M \\) must be true (Mark bought the blue shirt) according to the original statement.\n   - However, if \\( M \\) is true (Mark bought the blue shirt), it does not necessarily mean \\( L \\) is true (Lisa bought the red shirt). There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt that are not related to Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nAnswer: no",
