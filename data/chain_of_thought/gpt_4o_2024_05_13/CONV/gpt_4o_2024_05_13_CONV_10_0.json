The original statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   - Where \\( D \\) represents \"the dog was inside\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the cat was outside.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow D \\)\n\n3. In logic, the statement \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) does not necessarily imply \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow D \\). The latter is the converse of the former, and a statement and its converse are not logically equivalent.\n\n4. To illustrate this, consider a counterexample:\n   - Suppose the dog is not inside (i.e., \\( \\neg D \\)).\n   - The original statement \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) does not provide any information about what happens when \\( \\neg D \\) is true.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg C \\) (the cat being outside) does not guarantee \\( D \\) (the dog being inside).\n\nBased on this reasoning, we cannot infer 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside' from 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'.\n\nAnswer: no",
