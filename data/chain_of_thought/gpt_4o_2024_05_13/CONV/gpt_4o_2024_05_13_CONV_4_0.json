The original statement is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( B \\) is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow A \\)\n\nIn logic, \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) does not imply \\( B \\rightarrow A \\). The original statement is a conditional statement, and its converse (switching the hypothesis and conclusion) is not necessarily true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars' from 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter'.\n\nAnswer: no",
