The original statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\)\n\nIn logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). The latter is known as the converse of the former, and the truth of an implication does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Let \\( P \\) be \"It is raining.\"\n- Let \\( Q \\) be \"The ground is wet.\"\n\nThe statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" (\\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)) is generally true. However, the converse \"If the ground is wet, then it is raining\" (\\( Q \\rightarrow P \\)) is not necessarily true because the ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., someone watered the garden).\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" we cannot infer \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
