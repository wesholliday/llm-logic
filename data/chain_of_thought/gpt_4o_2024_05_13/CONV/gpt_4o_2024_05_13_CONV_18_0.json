The original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\)\n\nIn logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). The latter is known as the converse of the former, and the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'.\n\nAnswer: no",
