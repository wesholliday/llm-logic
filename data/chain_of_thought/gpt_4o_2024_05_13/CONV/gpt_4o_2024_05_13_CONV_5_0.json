            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball' from 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   - Where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow J \\)\n\nIn logic, the statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) does not imply \\( A \\rightarrow J \\). The original statement is a conditional statement, and its converse (switching the hypothesis and conclusion) is not necessarily true.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Suppose Jeff did not play basketball. The original statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) does not provide any information about whether Amy played tennis or not.\n- Suppose Amy played tennis. The original statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) does not guarantee that Jeff played basketball.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( A \\rightarrow J \\) from \\( J \\rightarrow A \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
