The original statement is: \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the case\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( W \\rightarrow B \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) does not imply \\( W \\rightarrow B \\). The original statement is a conditional statement, and its converse (reversing the direction of the implication) is not necessarily true.\n\n4. To illustrate this with an example:\n   - Suppose \\( B \\) is true (the bear is in the case), then \\( W \\) must be true (the wolf is in the den) according to the original statement.\n   - However, if \\( W \\) is true (the wolf is in the den), it does not necessarily mean that \\( B \\) is true (the bear is in the case). There could be other reasons why the wolf is in the den that do not involve the bear being in the case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case' from 'If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den'.\n\nAnswer: no",
