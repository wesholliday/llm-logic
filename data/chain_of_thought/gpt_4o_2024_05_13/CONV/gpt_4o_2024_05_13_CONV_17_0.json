The original statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not necessarily imply \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). The latter is known as the converse of the former, and the truth of an implication does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\n4. To illustrate this with an example:\n   - Suppose \\( P \\) is true (Ben ate pasta), then \\( Q \\) must be true (Kate ate salad) according to the original statement.\n   - However, if \\( Q \\) is true (Kate ate salad), it does not necessarily mean \\( P \\) is true (Ben ate pasta). Kate could have eaten salad for some other reason unrelated to Ben eating pasta.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta\" from \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
