The original statement is: 'The movie must have been in English.'\n2. The inferred statement is: 'The movie must have been in English or had English subtitles.'\n\nThe original statement asserts that the only acceptable condition is that the movie is in English. It does not mention anything about subtitles. The inferred statement introduces an additional condition (having English subtitles) that was not present in the original statement.\n\nIn logical terms, the original statement is more restrictive, while the inferred statement is more inclusive. The original statement does not allow for the possibility of the movie having English subtitles instead of being in English. Therefore, we cannot infer the more inclusive statement from the more restrictive one.\n\nAnswer: no",
