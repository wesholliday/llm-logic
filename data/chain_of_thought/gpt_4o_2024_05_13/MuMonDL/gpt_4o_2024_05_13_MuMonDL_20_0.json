            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The event must have been formal or black-tie' from 'The event must have been formal', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is 'The event must have been formal'.\n2. The inferred statement is 'The event must have been formal or black-tie'.\n\nThe key here is understanding the logical structure of the statements:\n- 'Formal' is a specific type of event.\n- 'Black-tie' is a subset of formal events, meaning all black-tie events are formal, but not all formal events are black-tie.\n\nThe statement 'The event must have been formal' asserts that the event was formal. The inferred statement 'The event must have been formal or black-tie' includes the possibility of the event being either formal or black-tie. Since black-tie is a type of formal event, the inferred statement does not contradict the original statement and actually broadens the scope to include a specific type of formal event.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement logically follows from the original statement because it includes the original condition (formal) and adds an additional specific condition (black-tie) that is consistent with the original condition.\n\nAnswer: yes",
