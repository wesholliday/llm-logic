The original statement, 'The package must have been delivered today', asserts that the delivery of the package definitely occurred today.\n2. The inferred statement, 'The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow', suggests that the delivery could have occurred either today or tomorrow.\n\nThe original statement is more specific, stating that the delivery happened today. The inferred statement introduces an additional possibility (tomorrow) that is not supported by the original statement. Therefore, the inferred statement is less specific and does not logically follow from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
