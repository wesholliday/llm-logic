The original statement is 'The application must have been completed online'. This means that the only acceptable way to complete the application is through an online process.\n2. The inferred statement is 'The application must have been completed online or submitted electronically'. This statement introduces an additional option, suggesting that the application could either be completed online or submitted electronically by some other means.\n\nThe key difference here is that the original statement specifies only one method (online completion), while the inferred statement allows for an alternative method (electronic submission). Since the original statement does not mention any alternative methods, we cannot infer the additional option of electronic submission from it.\n\nTherefore, the inference is not valid because the original statement does not provide any information about other methods of submission.\n\nAnswer: no",
