            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours' from 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\nThe original statement, 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays', asserts a specific condition: the restaurant was closed on Mondays. This is a definitive statement about the restaurant's status on Mondays.\n\nThe inferred statement, 'The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays or had limited hours', introduces an additional possibility: the restaurant either was closed on Mondays or had limited hours. This statement is broader because it includes the possibility of limited hours in addition to being closed.\n\nLogically, if the restaurant was closed on Mondays, it satisfies the condition of being closed on Mondays or having limited hours (since being closed is a more specific case of having limited hours, where the hours are zero). Therefore, the original statement implies the inferred statement because the condition of being closed on Mondays is a subset of the broader condition of being closed or having limited hours.\n\nThus, we can infer the broader statement from the more specific one.\n\nAnswer: yes",
