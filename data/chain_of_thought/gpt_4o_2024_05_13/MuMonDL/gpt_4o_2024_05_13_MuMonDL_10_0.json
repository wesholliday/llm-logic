The original statement is 'The document must have been signed'.\n2. The inferred statement is 'The document must have been signed or approved'.\n\nThe original statement asserts that the document was signed. The inferred statement presents two possibilities: either the document was signed or it was approved. \n\nSince the original statement confirms that the document was signed, it satisfies one of the conditions in the inferred statement ('signed or approved'). Therefore, the inferred statement is true whenever the original statement is true because the condition of being signed is met.\n\nThus, we can logically infer 'The document must have been signed or approved' from 'The document must have been signed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
