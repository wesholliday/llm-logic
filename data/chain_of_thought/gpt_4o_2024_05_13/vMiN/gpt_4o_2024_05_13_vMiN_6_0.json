If it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza (\u25c7\u00acP), then it is not necessary that Sue chose pizza (\u00ac\u25a1P). This equivalence is a well-known principle in modal logic.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
