            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise:** \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"It is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n   - In modal logic, this can be expressed as: \u25c7\u00acP (where \u25c7 represents \"possibly\" and \u00acP represents \"not P\").\n\n2. **Conclusion:** \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"It is not necessary that Mary was at the wedding.\"\n   - In modal logic, this can be expressed as: \u00ac\u25a1P (where \u25a1 represents \"necessarily\" and P represents \"Mary was at the wedding\").\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between the premise and the conclusion in modal logic terms:\n\n- The premise \u25c7\u00acP states that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n- The conclusion \u00ac\u25a1P states that it is not necessary that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nIn modal logic, if something is possible (\u25c7\u00acP), it implies that it is not necessarily false (\u00ac\u25a1P). In other words, if it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding, then it cannot be the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the premise logically leads to the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
