This is because if it were necessarily true (\u25a1A), then it would be true in all possible worlds, and there would be no possible world where it is not true. Therefore, the existence of a possible world where the alien did not visit Mars (\u25c7\u00acA) implies that it is not true in all possible worlds that the alien visited Mars (\u00ac\u25a1A).\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid because the premise logically leads to the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
