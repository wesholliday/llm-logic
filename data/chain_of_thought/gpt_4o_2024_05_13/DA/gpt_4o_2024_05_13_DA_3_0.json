The first statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book was not written by James.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg Q \\) (The book is not a mystery novel) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn propositional logic, the implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide any information about \\( Q \\) when \\( P \\) is false. The truth table for \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is as follows:\n\n| \\( P \\) | \\( Q \\) | \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     |\n| T      | F      | F                     |\n| F      | T      | T                     |\n| F      | F      | T                     |\n\nWhen \\( P \\) is false (\\( \\neg P \\)), the implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is always true regardless of the truth value of \\( Q \\). Therefore, from \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot infer anything about \\( Q \\).\n\nThus, from the statements \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and \"The book was not written by James,\" we cannot infer \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
