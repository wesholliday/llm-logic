The first statement is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow R \\)\n     where \\( A \\) represents \"The alien visited Mars\" and \\( R \\) represents \"The robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg R \\) (The robot did not visit Jupiter) can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nIn propositional logic, the implication \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) means that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( R \\) must also be true. However, if \\( A \\) is false, the implication \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( R \\). The implication is vacuously true when \\( A \\) is false, regardless of whether \\( R \\) is true or false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg A \\) (The alien did not visit Mars), the implication \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) holds true, but it does not allow us to conclude anything about \\( R \\). Therefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg R \\) (The robot did not visit Jupiter) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
