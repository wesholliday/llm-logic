The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The car was not red.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg Q \\) (The truck was not blue) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). Both statements are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nHowever, the given statements are:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nFrom these, we cannot directly infer \\( \\neg Q \\). The reason is that the truth of \\( \\neg P \\) (The car was not red) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( Q \\) (The truck was blue). The conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us what happens if \\( P \\) is true, not what happens if \\( P \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude \\( \\neg Q \\) from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
