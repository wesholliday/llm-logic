The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue did not choose pizza.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg Q \\) (Bob did not choose pasta) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot directly infer \\( \\neg Q \\). This is because the truth of \\( Q \\) is not dependent on the falsity of \\( P \\). The conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us what happens if \\( P \\) is true, not what happens if \\( P \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
