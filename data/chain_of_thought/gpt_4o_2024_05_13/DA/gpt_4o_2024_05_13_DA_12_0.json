The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Joe did not go to the park.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n   where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg Z \\) (Lucy did not go to the zoo) from \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) does not provide any information about what happens if \\( P \\) is false. The truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) is not affected by the truth value of \\( Z \\) when \\( P \\) is false. Therefore, from \\( \\neg P \\) alone, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of \\( Z \\).\n\nThus, we cannot conclude \\( \\neg Z \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
