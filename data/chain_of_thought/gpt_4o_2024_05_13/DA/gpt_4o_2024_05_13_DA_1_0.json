            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Sue was not at the wedding' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg M \\)\n   where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding) from \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n4. In logic, the conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) does not provide any information about what happens when \\( M \\) is false. The truth table for a conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is as follows:\n   - If \\( M \\) is true and \\( S \\) is true, \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is true.\n   - If \\( M \\) is true and \\( S \\) is false, \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is false.\n   - If \\( M \\) is false and \\( S \\) is true, \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is true.\n   - If \\( M \\) is false and \\( S \\) is false, \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is true.\n\n5. From the truth table, we see that when \\( M \\) is false (\\( \\neg M \\)), the conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is always true regardless of the truth value of \\( S \\). This means that \\( S \\) can be either true or false when \\( M \\) is false.\n\n6. Therefore, from \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we cannot definitively infer \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
