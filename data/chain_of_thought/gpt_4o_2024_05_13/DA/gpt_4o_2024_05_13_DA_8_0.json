            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"The mummy was not awake\" from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   - Where \\( V \\) represents \"The vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg V \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \"The mummy was not awake\" (i.e., \\( \\neg M \\)) from the given statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) means that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true. However, if \\( V \\) is false, the conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( M \\). The statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) is true regardless of whether \\( M \\) is true or false when \\( V \\) is false.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n- \\( \\neg V \\)\n\nFrom \\( \\neg V \\), we know that the vampire was not awake. However, this does not give us any information about whether the mummy was awake or not. The mummy could be awake or not awake, and the conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) would still hold true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg M \\) (the mummy was not awake) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
