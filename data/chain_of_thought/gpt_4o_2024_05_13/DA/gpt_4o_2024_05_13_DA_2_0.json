The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n   where \\( G \\) represents \"The griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg G \\)\n   where \\( \\neg G \\) represents \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg U \\) (The unicorn was not in the forest) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) does not provide information about what happens when \\( G \\) is false. The truth table for a conditional statement \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) is as follows:\n\n- If \\( G \\) is true and \\( U \\) is true, \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) is true.\n- If \\( G \\) is true and \\( U \\) is false, \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) is false.\n- If \\( G \\) is false and \\( U \\) is true, \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) is true.\n- If \\( G \\) is false and \\( U \\) is false, \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) is true.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg G \\) (The griffin was not in the forest), the conditional statement \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) is true regardless of whether \\( U \\) is true or false. Therefore, from \\( \\neg G \\) alone, we cannot infer anything about the truth value of \\( U \\).\n\nThus, we cannot infer \\( \\neg U \\) (The unicorn was not in the forest) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
