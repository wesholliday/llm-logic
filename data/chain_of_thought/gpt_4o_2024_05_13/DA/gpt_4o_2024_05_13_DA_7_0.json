The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Alex did not finish the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg A \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg C \\) (Chris did not finish the race) from \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) does not provide any information about \\( C \\) if \\( A \\) is false. The truth table for a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is as follows:\n\n| \\( A \\) | \\( C \\) | \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     |\n| T      | F      | F                     |\n| F      | T      | T                     |\n| F      | F      | T                     |\n\nFrom the table, we see that when \\( A \\) is false (\\( \\neg A \\)), the conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is true regardless of the truth value of \\( C \\). Therefore, knowing \\( \\neg A \\) does not allow us to infer anything about \\( C \\).\n\nThus, from \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), we cannot infer \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
