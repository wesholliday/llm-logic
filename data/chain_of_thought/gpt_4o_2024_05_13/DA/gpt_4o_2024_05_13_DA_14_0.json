The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n     where \\( B \\) represents \"The bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg W \\) (The wolf was not in the den) can be inferred from \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) is \\( \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, we are given \\( \\neg B \\), not \\( \\neg W \\).\n\nGiven \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we cannot directly infer \\( \\neg W \\). The truth of \\( \\neg B \\) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( W \\). The wolf could still be in the den or not in the den regardless of whether the bear is in the cave or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg W \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
