            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The muffins were not blueberry' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg M \\) (the muffins were not blueberry) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, we are given \\( \\neg C \\) and not \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nFrom \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg C \\), we cannot directly infer \\( \\neg M \\). The only thing we can infer is that the conditional statement does not provide any information about the muffins when the cake is not chocolate. Therefore, we cannot conclude \\( \\neg M \\) based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
