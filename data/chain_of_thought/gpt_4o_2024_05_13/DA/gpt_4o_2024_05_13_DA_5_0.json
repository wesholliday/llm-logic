            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Amy did not play tennis' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg J \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg A \\) (Amy did not play tennis) from \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) does not provide any information about what happens if \\( J \\) is false. The truth of \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is not affected by the truth value of \\( A \\) when \\( J \\) is false. In other words, if Jeff did not play basketball, the conditional statement does not tell us anything about whether Amy played tennis or not.\n\nTherefore, from \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( \\neg J \\), we cannot infer \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
