            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg L \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg M \\) (Mark did not buy the blue shirt) from \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg L \\).\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) means that if \\( L \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true. However, if \\( L \\) is false, the conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( M \\). The conditional statement is still true regardless of whether \\( M \\) is true or false when \\( L \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, from \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg L \\), we cannot infer \\( \\neg M \\). The truth value of \\( M \\) remains undetermined based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
