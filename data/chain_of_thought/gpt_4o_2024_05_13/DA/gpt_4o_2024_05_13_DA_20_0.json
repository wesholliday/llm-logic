            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"The apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The apple was not red.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg B \\) (The banana was not yellow) can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nIn logic, the conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( B \\) when \\( A \\) is false. The conditional statement only specifies what happens if \\( A \\) is true. When \\( A \\) is false, the conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is always true regardless of the truth value of \\( B \\).\n\nTherefore, from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), we cannot infer \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
