The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Tom did not watch football.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg T \\)\n   where \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg J \\) (Jen did not watch basketball) from \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and \\( \\neg T \\).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) does not provide any information about what happens when \\( T \\) is false. The truth table for a conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is as follows:\n\n| \\( T \\) | \\( J \\) | \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     |\n| T      | F      | F                     |\n| F      | T      | T                     |\n| F      | F      | T                     |\n\nFrom the table, we see that when \\( T \\) is false (\\( \\neg T \\)), the conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is true regardless of the truth value of \\( J \\). This means that \\( J \\) can be either true or false when \\( T \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, from \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and \\( \\neg T \\), we cannot infer \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
