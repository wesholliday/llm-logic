            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The blurble might be blimple by zizz or zazzle.\" This indicates that there are two possible ways for the blurble to be blimple: either by zizz or by zazzle. The use of \"or\" suggests that either one of these conditions could be true independently. Therefore, it is possible that the blurble might be blimple by zizz alone, without considering zazzle.\n\nAnswer: yes",
