The original statement suggests that 'The fizzle might be glorp' applies to either 'a quimble' or 'a quibble'. This means that 'The fizzle might be glorp for a quimble' is one of the possible scenarios included in the original statement. Since the original statement allows for the possibility that 'The fizzle might be glorp for a quimble', we can indeed infer that specific part.\n\nAnswer: yes",
