The use of \"might be\" suggests that either option is possible, but it does not confirm either one definitively. Since \"quibble\" is one of the two possibilities mentioned, it is correct to infer that \"The blimp might be quibble\" is a valid statement based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
