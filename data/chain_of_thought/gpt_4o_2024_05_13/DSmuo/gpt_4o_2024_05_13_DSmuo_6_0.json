We have \u00ac(M), which means \"it is not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n2. We also have L \u2228 M, which means \"either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n\nGiven \u00ac(M), we know that M is false. Therefore, the disjunction L \u2228 M simplifies to L \u2228 false, which is just L.\n\nSince M is false, the only remaining possibility in the disjunction L \u2228 M is L.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that L (the phone is in the living room).\n\nAnswer: yes",
