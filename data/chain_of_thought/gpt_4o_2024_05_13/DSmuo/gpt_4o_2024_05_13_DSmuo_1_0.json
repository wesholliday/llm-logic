The first statement is: \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00ac(Fido must be in the garden).\n   - Let's denote \"Fido must be in the garden\" as G.\n   - Therefore, the first statement is: \u00acG.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\"\n   - This can be written as: (Fido is inside) \u2228 (Fido must be in the garden).\n   - Let's denote \"Fido is inside\" as I.\n   - Therefore, the second statement is: I \u2228 G.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer I (Fido is inside) from \u00acG and I \u2228 G.\n\n3. We have \u00acG (Fido must not be in the garden).\n4. We also have I \u2228 G (Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden).\n\nGiven \u00acG, we know that G is false. Therefore, the disjunction I \u2228 G simplifies to I \u2228 false, which is just I.\n\nSince I \u2228 false is equivalent to I, we can conclude that I (Fido is inside) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
