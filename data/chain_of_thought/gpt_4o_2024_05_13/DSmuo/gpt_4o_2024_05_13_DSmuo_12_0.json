D \u2228 C (where D represents \"The jacket is draped over the chair\")\n\nGiven \u00acC (the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet), we can substitute this into the second statement:\n- D \u2228 C becomes D \u2228 \u00acC.\n\nSince \u00acC is true (from the first statement), the disjunction D \u2228 \u00acC must be true. In a disjunction, if one part is true, the whole statement is true. Therefore, D (the jacket is draped over the chair) must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
