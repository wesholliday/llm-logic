We know \u00acH is true (the cookies do not have to be hidden in the pantry).\n2. We also know J \u2228 H is true (either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry).\n\nGiven \u00acH (the cookies do not have to be hidden in the pantry), H is false. Therefore, the disjunction J \u2228 H simplifies to J \u2228 false, which is equivalent to J.\n\nSince J \u2228 false is logically equivalent to J, and we know \u00acH is true, we can conclude that J must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
