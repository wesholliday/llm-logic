The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"It is not necessary that the notebook is on the nightstand.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \u00ac(N), where N represents \"the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: D \u2228 N, where D represents \"the notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we have \u00ac(N).\n- From the second statement, we have D \u2228 N.\n\nUsing the rule of disjunction in logic, if we have a disjunction (D \u2228 N) and we know that one of the components (N) is false (\u00acN), then the other component (D) must be true.\n\nTherefore, since \u00acN is true, D must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
