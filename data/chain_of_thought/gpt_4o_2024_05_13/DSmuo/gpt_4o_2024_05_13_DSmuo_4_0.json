N \u2228 M\n\nFrom statement 1, we know that M is false (\u00acM is true). \n\nGiven statement 2 (N \u2228 M), we know that for the disjunction (N \u2228 M) to be true, at least one of N or M must be true. Since we have established that M is false (\u00acM is true), the only way for the disjunction (N \u2228 M) to be true is if N is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that N (the cat is napping on the couch) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
