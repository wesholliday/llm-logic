This means that the possibility of the puzzle piece blending in on the floor is not a requirement.\n- Statement 2 provides two possibilities: either the puzzle piece is in the box, or it must be blending in on the floor.\n\nGiven that statement 1 negates the necessity of the puzzle piece blending in on the floor, the only remaining possibility from statement 2 is that the puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
