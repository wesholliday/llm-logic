We have \u00ac(M), which means M is false.\n2. We also have S \u2228 M, which means at least one of S or M must be true.\n3. Since M is false (from \u00ac(M)), the only way for S \u2228 M to be true is if S is true.\n\nTherefore, given that M is false and S \u2228 M must be true, S must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
