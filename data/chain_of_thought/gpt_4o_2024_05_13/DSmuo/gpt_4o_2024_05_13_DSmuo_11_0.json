From \u00ac(P), we know that P is false.\n2. Given D \u2228 P, we have a disjunction where at least one of the statements (D or P) must be true.\n3. Since P is false (from \u00ac(P)), the only way for the disjunction D \u2228 P to be true is if D is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that D (the newspaper is in the driveway) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
