The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00ac(M), where M represents \"the milk must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge.\"\n   - This can be written as: C \u2228 M, where C represents \"the milk is on the counter.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer C (the milk is on the counter) from \u00ac(M) and C \u2228 M.\n\nLet's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From \u00ac(M), we know that M is false.\n- Given C \u2228 M, if M is false, then for the disjunction (C \u2228 M) to be true, C must be true.\n\nSince M is false and C \u2228 M is true, the only way for the disjunction to hold is if C is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
