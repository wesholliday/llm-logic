The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The scarf does not have to be draped on the coat rack.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"It is not necessary that the scarf is on the coat rack.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The scarf is either in my backpack or on the coat rack.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is an \"or\" statement: \"Scarf in backpack OR scarf on coat rack.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that it is not necessary for the scarf to be on the coat rack.\n- From the second statement, we know that the scarf is either in the backpack or on the coat rack.\n\nGiven that the scarf does not have to be on the coat rack (first statement), the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the scarf is in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
