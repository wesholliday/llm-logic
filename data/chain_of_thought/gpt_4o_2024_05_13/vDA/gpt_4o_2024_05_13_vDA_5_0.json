            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Amy did not play tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The premises are:\n  1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n  2. \\( \\neg P \\)\n\n- The conclusion is:\n  \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if \\( \\neg Q \\) necessarily follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logic, the argument form we have is:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n2. \\( \\neg P \\)\n3. Therefore, \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a formal fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of \\( \\neg P \\) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( Q \\). In other words, just because Jeff did not play basketball (\\( \\neg P \\)), it does not necessarily mean that Amy did not play tennis (\\( \\neg Q \\)). Amy could have played tennis for reasons unrelated to whether Jeff played basketball.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
