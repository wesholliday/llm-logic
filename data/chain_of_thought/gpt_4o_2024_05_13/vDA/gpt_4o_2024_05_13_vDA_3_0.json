The first premise is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The book was not written by James.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n2. \\( \\neg P \\)\n3. \\( \\therefore \\neg Q \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) necessarily follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a formal fallacy. The fallacy occurs because from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot logically conclude \\( \\neg Q \\). The truth of \\( Q \\) is not determined solely by the truth of \\( P \\); \\( Q \\) could still be true even if \\( P \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
