            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg V \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The mummy was not awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n- From the first premise \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), we know that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg V \\) tells us that \\( V \\) is false.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion \\( \\neg M \\) logically follows, we need to consider the implications of \\( \\neg V \\) on \\( M \\):\n\n- The first premise \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) does not provide any information about what happens when \\( V \\) is false. It only tells us what happens if \\( V \\) is true.\n- Therefore, knowing \\( \\neg V \\) (the vampire was not awake) does not give us any information about the truth value of \\( M \\) (whether the mummy was awake or not).\n\nSince the premises do not provide sufficient information to conclude \\( \\neg M \\) (the mummy was not awake), the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
