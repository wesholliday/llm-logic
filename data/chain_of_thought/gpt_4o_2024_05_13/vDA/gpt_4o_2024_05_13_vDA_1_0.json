The first premise is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg M \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg S \\)\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if \\( \\neg S \\) logically follows from \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n- \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) means that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must also be true.\n- \\( \\neg M \\) means that \\( M \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we need to determine if \\( \\neg S \\) necessarily follows.\n\nIn logical terms, if \\( M \\) is false, the implication \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( S \\). The implication \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is true whenever \\( M \\) is false, regardless of whether \\( S \\) is true or false. Therefore, from \\( \\neg M \\), we cannot conclude \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg S \\) does not logically follow from the premises \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
