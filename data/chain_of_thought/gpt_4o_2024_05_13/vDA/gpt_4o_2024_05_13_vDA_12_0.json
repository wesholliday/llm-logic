            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Joe did not go to the park.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n   where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg Z \\)\n   where \\( \\neg Z \\) represents \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The first premise \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) states that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Z \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg P \\) states that \\( P \\) is false.\n\nTo determine if the conclusion \\( \\neg Z \\) logically follows, we need to consider the implications of the premises:\n\n- From \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot directly conclude \\( \\neg Z \\). The premises do not provide information about what happens when \\( P \\) is false. The implication \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) only tells us what happens if \\( P \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg Z \\) does not logically follow from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
