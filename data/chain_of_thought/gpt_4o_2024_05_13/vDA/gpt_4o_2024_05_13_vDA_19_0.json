            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball. (Symbolically: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\))\n2. Premise 2: Tom did not watch football. (Symbolically: \\( \\neg T \\))\n3. Conclusion: Jen did not watch basketball. (Symbolically: \\( \\neg J \\))\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion (\\( \\neg J \\)) necessarily follows from the premises (\\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and \\( \\neg T \\)).\n\nLet's analyze the premises:\n\n- Premise 1 (\\( T \\rightarrow J \\)) states that if \\( T \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must be true.\n- Premise 2 (\\( \\neg T \\)) states that \\( T \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg T \\), we know that \\( T \\) is false. However, the implication \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) does not provide any information about \\( J \\) when \\( T \\) is false. An implication \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is true whenever \\( T \\) is false, regardless of the truth value of \\( J \\).\n\nTherefore, from \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and \\( \\neg T \\), we cannot conclude anything about the truth value of \\( J \\). \\( J \\) could be either true or false, and thus \\( \\neg J \\) does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nSince the conclusion \\( \\neg J \\) does not logically follow from the premises, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
