            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The doll was not plastic.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The truck was not metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\)) and \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)), we need to determine if \\( \\neg Q \\) (not \\( Q \\)) logically follows.\n\nThis argument form is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a formal fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of \\( \\neg P \\) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( Q \\). In other words, just because the antecedent (\\( P \\)) is false, it does not necessarily mean that the consequent (\\( Q \\)) is false.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- If the statement \"If it is raining, then the ground is wet\" (\\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)) is true, and we know \"It is not raining\" (\\( \\neg P \\)), we cannot conclude \"The ground is not wet\" (\\( \\neg Q \\)) because the ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., a sprinkler).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not logically follow from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
