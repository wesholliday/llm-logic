            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (If P, then Q)\n2. Premise 2: The apple was not red. (Not P)\n3. Conclusion: The banana was not yellow. (Not Q)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent.\" The structure of denying the antecedent is:\n\n- If P, then Q.\n- Not P.\n- Therefore, not Q.\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In formal logic, denying the antecedent is a logical fallacy because the truth of the conclusion is not guaranteed by the premises. The premises do not provide enough information to conclude that Q is false just because P is false. There could be other reasons why Q might still be true even if P is false.\n\nFor example, consider the following:\n- If it rains, then the ground will be wet. (If P, then Q)\n- It did not rain. (Not P)\n- Therefore, the ground is not wet. (Not Q)\n\nThis conclusion is not necessarily true because the ground could be wet for other reasons, such as someone watering the garden.\n\nTherefore, the argument in question is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
