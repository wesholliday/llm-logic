            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The pants were not denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure:\n\n- We have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If \\( P \\), then \\( Q \\)).\n- We also have \\( \\neg P \\) (Not \\( P \\)).\n\nFrom these premises, we need to determine if \\( \\neg Q \\) (Not \\( Q \\)) logically follows.\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent,\" which is a formal fallacy. The fallacy occurs because the truth of \\( \\neg P \\) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( Q \\). In other words, just because the shirt was not cotton (\\( \\neg P \\)), it does not necessarily mean that the pants were not denim (\\( \\neg Q \\)).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg Q \\) does not logically follow from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
