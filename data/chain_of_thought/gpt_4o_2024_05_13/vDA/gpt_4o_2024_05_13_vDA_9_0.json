            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (If L, then M)\n2. Premise 2: Lisa did not buy the red shirt. (Not L)\n3. Conclusion: Mark did not buy the blue shirt. (Not M)\n\nThis argument can be analyzed using the rules of logical implication. The first premise is a conditional statement (If L, then M). The second premise is the negation of the antecedent of the conditional statement (Not L).\n\nTo determine if the conclusion (Not M) follows from these premises, we can use the rule of inference known as \"Modus Tollens.\" However, Modus Tollens requires the negation of the consequent (Not M) to infer the negation of the antecedent (Not L), which is not the case here.\n\nInstead, the argument seems to be attempting to use the fallacy known as \"Denying the Antecedent,\" which is not a valid form of argument. Denying the antecedent takes the form:\n\n1. If P, then Q.\n2. Not P.\n3. Therefore, Not Q.\n\nThis form of argument is invalid because the truth of Q is not necessarily dependent on P being true. There could be other reasons for Q to be true even if P is false.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion (Mark did not buy the blue shirt) does not logically follow from the premises given.\n\nAnswer: no",
