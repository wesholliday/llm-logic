It does not definitively state that the remote control is not under the couch; it only suggests a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\"\n   - This is a disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement). It means that one of the two conditions must be true: either the remote control is under the couch, or it is on the coffee table.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n- Statement 1 introduces the possibility that the remote control is not under the couch, but it does not definitively rule out that it is under the couch.\n\nTo infer that the remote control is on the coffee table, we would need to definitively rule out the possibility that it is under the couch. However, Statement 1 only suggests that it might not be under the couch, not that it definitely is not under the couch.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table because the possibility remains that it could still be under the couch.\n\nAnswer: no",
