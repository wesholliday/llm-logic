The first statement is: \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\"\n   - This means it is possible that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor. However, it does not definitively state that the piece is not blending in on the floor; it only suggests a possibility.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\"\n   - This is a disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement). It means that one of the two conditions must be true: either the piece is blending in on the floor, or it is in the box.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From the second statement, we know that one of the two conditions must be true: the piece is blending in on the floor, or it is in the box.\n- The first statement suggests that it is possible the piece is not blending in on the floor, but it does not rule out the possibility that it is blending in on the floor.\n\nGiven that the first statement does not definitively rule out the piece blending in on the floor, we cannot conclude with certainty that the piece is in the box. The piece could still be blending in on the floor, as the first statement only indicates a possibility, not a certainty.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The missing puzzle piece is in the box' with certainty from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
