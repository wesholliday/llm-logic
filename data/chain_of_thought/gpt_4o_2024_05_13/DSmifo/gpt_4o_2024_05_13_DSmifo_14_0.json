It does not definitively state that the milk is not in the fridge; it only suggests a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the milk must be chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the milk is in the fridge, or it is on the counter.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that one of the two conditions must hold: the milk is either in the fridge or on the counter.\n- Statement 1 introduces the possibility that the milk might not be in the fridge. However, it does not definitively state that the milk is not in the fridge.\n\nTo infer that \"The milk is on the counter,\" we would need a definitive statement that the milk is not in the fridge. Since Statement 1 only suggests a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: no",
