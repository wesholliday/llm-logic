However, it does not definitively state that the book is not on the table; it only suggests a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\"\n   - This is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement) which means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the book is on the table, or the book is on the shelf.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the book is not on the table.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the book is not on the table, then it must be on the shelf (because the disjunction requires at least one of the conditions to be true).\n\nGiven that Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the book is not on the table, and Statement 2 states that if the book is not on the table, it must be on the shelf, we can infer that if the book is not on the table, it must be on the shelf.\n\nHowever, Statement 1 does not definitively state that the book is not on the table; it only suggests a possibility. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf based solely on these statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
