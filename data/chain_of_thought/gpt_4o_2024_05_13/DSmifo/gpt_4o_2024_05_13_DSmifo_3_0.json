The first statement is: \"The keys might not be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This means it is possible that the keys are not in the cabinet, but it does not definitively state that they are not there.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the keys are in the cabinet, or they are in the drawer.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- The second statement tells us that there are two possibilities: the keys are either in the cabinet or in the drawer.\n- The first statement suggests that it is possible the keys are not in the cabinet.\n\nIf the keys are not in the cabinet (as suggested by the first statement), then according to the second statement, the only remaining possibility is that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
