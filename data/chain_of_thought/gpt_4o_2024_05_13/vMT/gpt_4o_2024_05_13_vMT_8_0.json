            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The mummy was not awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg M \\)\n   where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"the mummy was not awake.\"\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The vampire was not awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg V \\)\n   where \\( \\neg V \\) represents \"the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), we know that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg M \\), we know that \\( M \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg M \\) (the mummy was not awake), we need to determine if \\( \\neg V \\) (the vampire was not awake) logically follows.\n\nUsing the contrapositive of the first premise:\n- The contrapositive of \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\).\n- Since \\( \\neg M \\) is true (the mummy was not awake), we can apply the contrapositive to conclude \\( \\neg V \\) (the vampire was not awake).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg V \\) logically follows from the premises \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
