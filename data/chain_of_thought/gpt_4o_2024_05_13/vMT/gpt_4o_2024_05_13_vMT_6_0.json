The first premise is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nWe can use the rules of logical inference to determine this:\n\n- From the first premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and the second premise \\( \\neg Q \\), we can apply the rule of Modus Tollens.\n- Modus Tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n2. \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nBy Modus Tollens:\n- From \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
