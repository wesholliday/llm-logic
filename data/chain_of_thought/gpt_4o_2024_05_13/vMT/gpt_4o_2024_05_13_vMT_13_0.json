            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The truck was not blue.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The car was not red.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus Tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nHere is the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n- From the first premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we know that if \\( P \\) (the car was red) is true, then \\( Q \\) (the truck was blue) must also be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg Q \\) tells us that \\( Q \\) (the truck was blue) is false.\n- Given that \\( Q \\) is false, and knowing that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) must hold, the only way for \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) to be true when \\( Q \\) is false is if \\( P \\) is also false.\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg P \\) (the car was not red) must be true.\n\nSince the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
