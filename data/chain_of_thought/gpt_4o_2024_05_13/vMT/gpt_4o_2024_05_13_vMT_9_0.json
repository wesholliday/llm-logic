            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg M \\)\n   where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg L \\)\n   where \\( \\neg L \\) represents \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), we know that if \\( L \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg M \\), we know that \\( M \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( M \\) is false, we need to determine if \\( L \\) can be true. According to the first premise \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), if \\( L \\) were true, then \\( M \\) would have to be true. However, since \\( M \\) is false, \\( L \\) cannot be true. Therefore, \\( L \\) must be false.\n\nThis means that the conclusion \\( \\neg L \\) logically follows from the premises \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
