            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n     where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg J \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument:\n\n- We have \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis).\n- We also have \\( \\neg A \\) (Amy did not play tennis).\n\nFrom these premises, we need to determine if \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball) logically follows.\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, we know that if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and the negation of the consequent \\( \\neg Q \\), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis)\n- \\( \\neg A \\) (Amy did not play tennis)\n\nBy modus tollens:\n- From \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg J \\) logically follows from the premises \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
