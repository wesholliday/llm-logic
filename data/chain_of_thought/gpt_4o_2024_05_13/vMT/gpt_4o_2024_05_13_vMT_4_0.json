            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The alien did not visit Mars.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n- From the first premise \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), we know that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must also be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg B \\) tells us that \\( B \\) is false.\n- Given \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can use the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). This means that if \\( B \\) is false, then \\( A \\) must also be false.\n- Since \\( \\neg B \\) is true (from the second premise), it follows that \\( \\neg A \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg A \\) logically follows from the premises \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
