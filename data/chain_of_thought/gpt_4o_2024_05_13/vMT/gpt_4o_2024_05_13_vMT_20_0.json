            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), where \\( A \\) represents \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The banana was not yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The apple was not red.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg B \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus Tollens states that if \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\) are true, then \\( \\neg A \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
