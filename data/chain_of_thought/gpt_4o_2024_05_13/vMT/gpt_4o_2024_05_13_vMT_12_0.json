The first premise is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Joe did not go to the park.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn propositional logic, we can use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if we have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), then we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nAccording to modus tollens, if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
