            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nThe argument can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Premise 1: If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal. (P \u2192 Q)\n2. Premise 2: The truck was not metal. (\u00acQ)\n3. Conclusion: The doll was not plastic. (\u00acP)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of logical reasoning. Modus Tollens states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), we can conclude the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nLet's apply Modus Tollens to the given argument:\n\n1. P \u2192 Q (If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal)\n2. \u00acQ (The truck was not metal)\n3. Therefore, \u00acP (The doll was not plastic)\n\nSince the structure of the argument matches the form of Modus Tollens, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
