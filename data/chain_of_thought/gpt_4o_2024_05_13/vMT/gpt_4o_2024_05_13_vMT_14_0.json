The first premise is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n   where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The wolf was not in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg W \\)\n   where \\( \\neg W \\) represents \"the wolf was not in the den.\"\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The bear was not in the cave.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg B \\)\n   where \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- We have \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) (If \\( B \\), then \\( W \\)).\n- We also have \\( \\neg W \\) (Not \\( W \\)).\n\nFrom these two premises, we need to determine if \\( \\neg B \\) (Not \\( B \\)) logically follows.\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens,\" which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) and \\( \\neg W \\) are true, then \\( \\neg B \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
