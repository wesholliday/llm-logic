The first premise is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( D \\) represents \"the dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The cat was not outside.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg C \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The dog was not inside.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg D \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( \\neg D \\) logically follows from \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens, we know that:\n- If \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) (if \\( D \\) then \\( C \\))\n- And \\( \\neg C \\) (not \\( C \\))\n\nThen we can conclude \\( \\neg D \\) (not \\( D \\)).\n\nThis is because modus tollens states that if \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\) are true, then \\( \\neg D \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
