            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Kate did not eat salad.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Ben did not eat pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThe argument can be analyzed using the rules of logical inference. Specifically, we can use the rule known as \"Modus Tollens,\" which states that if we have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nAccording to Modus Tollens, if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
