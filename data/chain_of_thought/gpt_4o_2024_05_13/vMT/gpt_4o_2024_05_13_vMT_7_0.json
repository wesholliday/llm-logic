The first premise is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Chris did not finish the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg C \\)\n   where \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Alex did not finish the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg A \\)\n   where \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( \\neg A \\) logically follows from \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, we can analyze the argument:\n- Modus tollens states that if \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\) are true, then \\( \\neg A \\) must be true.\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n2. \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nBy modus tollens:\n- From \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg A \\) logically follows from the premises \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
