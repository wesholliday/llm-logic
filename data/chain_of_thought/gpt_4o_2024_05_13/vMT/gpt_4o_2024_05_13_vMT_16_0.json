            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow P \\), where \\( S \\) represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( P \\) represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The pants were not denim.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( S \\rightarrow P \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg P \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg S \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus Tollens states that if \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\) are true, then \\( \\neg S \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
