            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Erin did not take a train.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sam did not take a plane.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then we can conclude that \\( P \\) must also be false (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nIn this case:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis matches the form of modus tollens, which is a valid logical argument form.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
