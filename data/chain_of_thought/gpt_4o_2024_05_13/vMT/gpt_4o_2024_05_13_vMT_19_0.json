            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg J \\)\n   where \\( \\neg J \\) represents \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Tom did not watch football.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg T \\)\n   where \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( T \\rightarrow J \\), we know that if \\( T \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must also be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg J \\), we know that \\( J \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( J \\) is false (\\( \\neg J \\)), for the implication \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) to hold true, \\( T \\) must also be false. This is because if \\( T \\) were true, \\( J \\) would have to be true as well, which contradicts the second premise \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nTherefore, \\( T \\) must be false, which means \\( \\neg T \\) is true.\n\nSince the conclusion \\( \\neg T \\) logically follows from the premises \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and \\( \\neg J \\), the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
