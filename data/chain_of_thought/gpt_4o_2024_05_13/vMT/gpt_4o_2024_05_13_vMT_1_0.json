            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg S \\)\n   where \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg M \\)\n   where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg S \\), we know that Sue was not at the wedding.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding), we can use the contrapositive of the first premise. The contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\). This means that if Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding), we can conclude \\( \\neg M \\) (Mary was not at the wedding) using the contrapositive.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg M \\) logically follows from the premises \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
