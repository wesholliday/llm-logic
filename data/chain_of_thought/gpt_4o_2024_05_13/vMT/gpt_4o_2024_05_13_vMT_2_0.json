            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n   where \\( G \\) represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg U \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The griffin was not in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg G \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( \\neg G \\) logically follows from \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\).\n\nIn propositional logic, we can use the rule of modus tollens, which states that if we have \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg G \\). This is because if \\( G \\) were true, then \\( U \\) would have to be true (according to the first premise). However, since \\( U \\) is false (according to the second premise), \\( G \\) must also be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion \\( \\neg G \\) follows from the premises \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\) using modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes",
