            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The muffins were not blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The cake was not chocolate.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nThis form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus Tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nHere is the reasoning step-by-step:\n- From the first premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we know that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg Q \\), we know that \\( Q \\) is false.\n- If \\( Q \\) is false, then \\( P \\) cannot be true because if \\( P \\) were true, \\( Q \\) would have to be true (which contradicts \\( \\neg Q \\)).\n- Therefore, \\( P \\) must be false, which means \\( \\neg P \\) is true.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
