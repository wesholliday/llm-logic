            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The book was not written by James.\" This can be symbolized as:\n   \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, let's examine the logical form of the argument:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus tollens,\" which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
