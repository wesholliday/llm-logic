The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was blue.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The car was red) can be deduced from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot deduce \\( P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The truth of \\( Q \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\). There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that the car was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
