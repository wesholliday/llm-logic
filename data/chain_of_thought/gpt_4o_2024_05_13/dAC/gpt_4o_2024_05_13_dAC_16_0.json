The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The shirt was cotton) can be deduced from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot deduce \\( P \\). This is because \\( Q \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true; \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\). \n\nFor example, the pants could be denim regardless of whether the shirt is cotton or not. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the shirt is cotton, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that the shirt was cotton based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
