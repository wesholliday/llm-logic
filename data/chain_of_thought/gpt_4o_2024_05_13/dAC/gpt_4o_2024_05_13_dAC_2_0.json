The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n   where \\( G \\) represents \"The griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( U \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can deduce \\( G \\) (The griffin was in the forest) from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we have:\n- \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n- \\( U \\)\n\nTo deduce \\( G \\) from these, we need to check if \\( G \\) necessarily follows from \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( U \\).\n\nHowever, the conditional statement \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) only tells us that if \\( G \\) is true, then \\( U \\) must be true. It does not provide any information about what happens if \\( U \\) is true. \\( U \\) being true does not imply that \\( G \\) must be true; it only implies that \\( G \\) could be true or false.\n\nTherefore, from \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( U \\), we cannot deduce \\( G \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
