The first statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can deduce \\( P \\) (The book was written by James) from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we are given:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to find out if \\( Q \\) implies \\( P \\).\n\nThis is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because \\( Q \\) is true, it does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true. There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce \\( P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
