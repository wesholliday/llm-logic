The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( M \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can deduce \\( C \\) (the cake was chocolate) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\), we cannot deduce \\( C \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) only tells us what happens if \\( C \\) is true, but it does not provide any information about the necessity of \\( C \\) being true if \\( M \\) is true. \\( M \\) could be true for reasons unrelated to \\( C \\).\n\nTherefore, the given information is not sufficient to deduce that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no",
