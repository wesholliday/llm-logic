The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can deduce \\( P \\) (The doll was plastic) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot deduce \\( P \\). This is because \\( Q \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true; \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\).\n\nFor example, consider the following analogous situation:\n- If it rains, then the ground will be wet. (If \\( P \\), then \\( Q \\))\n- The ground is wet. (\\( Q \\))\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that it rained (\\( P \\)), because the ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., someone watered the garden).\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce that the doll was plastic from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
