            "content": "To determine whether we can deduce 'Mary was at the wedding' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can deduce \\( M \\) (Mary was at the wedding) from these two statements.\n\n3. The conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) tells us that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if \\( S \\) is true. The truth of \\( S \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( M \\).\n\n4. Given \\( S \\) (Sue was at the wedding), we cannot conclude \\( M \\) (Mary was at the wedding) because the conditional statement only specifies what happens if Mary was at the wedding, not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot deduce that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
