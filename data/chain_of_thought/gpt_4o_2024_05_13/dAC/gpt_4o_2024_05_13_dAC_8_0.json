The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( V \\) represents \"The vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can deduce \\( V \\) (The vampire was awake) from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we have:\n- \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n- \\( M \\)\n\nTo deduce \\( V \\) from these, we need to check if \\( M \\) implies \\( V \\). However, the conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) only tells us that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true. It does not tell us anything about \\( V \\) when \\( M \\) is true. In other words, \\( M \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( V \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot deduce that the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
