The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Z \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can deduce \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) means that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Z \\) must also be true. However, it does not imply that if \\( Z \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be true. The truth of \\( Z \\) alone does not provide any information about the truth of \\( P \\).\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- If it rains, then the ground will be wet. (Conditional statement)\n- The ground is wet. (Observation)\n\nFrom the observation that the ground is wet, we cannot conclude that it rained because there could be other reasons for the ground being wet (e.g., someone watered the garden).\n\nSimilarly, from the statements:\n- If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n- Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nWe cannot conclude that Joe went to the park because Lucy going to the zoo could have happened for reasons unrelated to Joe going to the park.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: no",
