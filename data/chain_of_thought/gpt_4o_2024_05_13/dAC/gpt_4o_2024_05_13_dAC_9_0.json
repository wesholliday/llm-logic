However, the implication \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) only tells us that if \\( L \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true. It does not tell us anything about the situation where \\( M \\) is true independently of \\( L \\).\n\nIn other words, \\( M \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( L \\) must be true. \\( M \\) could be true for reasons unrelated to \\( L \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce \\( L \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
