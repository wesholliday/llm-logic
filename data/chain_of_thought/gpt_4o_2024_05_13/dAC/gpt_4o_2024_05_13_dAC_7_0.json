The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( C \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can deduce \\( A \\) (Alex finished the race) from these statements.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) tells us that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must also be true.\n- The statement \\( C \\) tells us that Chris finished the race, so \\( C \\) is true.\n\nHowever, knowing that \\( C \\) is true does not provide any information about \\( A \\). The truth of \\( C \\) does not imply the truth of \\( A \\); it only tells us that if \\( A \\) were true, then \\( C \\) would be true, which is already the case.\n\nTherefore, we cannot deduce \\( A \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
