However, the second premise only indicates a possibility (\\( Q \\) might not be true), not a certainty. Therefore, it does not provide a definitive basis to conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logical terms, the argument is not valid because the second premise does not definitively state \\( \\neg Q \\), and thus we cannot definitively conclude \\( \\neg P \\) from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
