For \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) to hold, if \\( S \\) is not true, then \\( M \\) cannot be true either because if \\( M \\) were true, \\( S \\) would have to be true. Therefore, if \\( S \\) is not true, \\( M \\) must not be true.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg M \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
