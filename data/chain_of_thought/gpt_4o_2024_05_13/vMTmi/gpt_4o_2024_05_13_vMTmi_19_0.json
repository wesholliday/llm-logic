            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. **First Premise:** If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n   - This can be written as: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\n2. **Second Premise:** Jen might not have watched basketball.\n   - This implies that it is possible that \\( J \\) is false.\n   - In logical terms, this can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg J \\) is possible.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Tom did not watch football.\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg T \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion \\( \\neg T \\) necessarily follows from the premises \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and \\( \\neg J \\) is possible.\n\n- From the first premise \\( T \\rightarrow J \\), we know that if \\( T \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must be true.\n- The second premise suggests that \\( J \\) might not be true (\\( \\neg J \\) is possible).\n\nFor the conclusion \\( \\neg T \\) to be valid, we need to show that \\( T \\) being true would lead to a contradiction given the premises.\n\n- If \\( T \\) were true, then \\( J \\) must be true (from \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)).\n- However, the second premise suggests that \\( J \\) might not be true, which would contradict the first premise if \\( T \\) were true.\n\nTherefore, to avoid this contradiction, \\( T \\) must be false. This means that the conclusion \\( \\neg T \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
