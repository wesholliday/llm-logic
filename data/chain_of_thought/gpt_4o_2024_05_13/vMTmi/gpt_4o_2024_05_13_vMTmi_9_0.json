            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. First premise: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. Second premise: \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg M \\) is possible.\n     However, for the argument to be valid, we need a stronger statement. Let's consider the stronger interpretation: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n     This can be written as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\n3. Conclusion: \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg L \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), we know that if \\( L \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg M \\), we know that \\( M \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can use the contrapositive of the first premise:\n- The contrapositive of \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\).\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg M \\) from the second premise, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- From \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg L \\).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg L \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
