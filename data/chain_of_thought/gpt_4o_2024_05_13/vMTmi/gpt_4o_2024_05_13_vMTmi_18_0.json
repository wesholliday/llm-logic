            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. **First Premise:** If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n   - Symbolically: \\( P \\rightarrow M \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the truck was metal\".\n\n2. **Second Premise:** The truck might not have been metal.\n   - This can be interpreted as: It is possible that the truck was not metal.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg M \\) is possible.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** The doll was not plastic.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) necessarily follows from the premises \\( P \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\) is possible.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n- **Premise 1:** \\( P \\rightarrow M \\)\n  - This means if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true.\n\n- **Premise 2:** \\( \\neg M \\) is possible.\n  - This means it is possible that \\( M \\) is false.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) must be true whenever the premises are true.\n\n- If \\( \\neg M \\) is possible, then \\( M \\) is not necessarily true.\n- If \\( M \\) is not necessarily true, then \\( P \\) cannot be true because if \\( P \\) were true, \\( M \\) would have to be true (according to the first premise).\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that \\( M \\) is false, then \\( P \\) must be false to avoid a contradiction with the first premise.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
