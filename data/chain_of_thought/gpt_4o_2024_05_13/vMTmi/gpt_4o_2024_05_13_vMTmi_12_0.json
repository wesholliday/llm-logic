            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n1. **First Premise**: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n   - This can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\n2. **Second Premise**: Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n   - This can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg Q \\) is possible.\n   - This means it is possible that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Joe did not go to the park.\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if \\( \\neg P \\) necessarily follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\) is possible.\n\n- The first premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- The second premise suggests that \\( Q \\) might not be true, which implies that \\( Q \\) is not necessarily true.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) must follow from the premises. Let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would have to be true (from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)).\n- However, the second premise suggests that \\( Q \\) might not be true, which means \\( Q \\) is not guaranteed to be true.\n- If \\( Q \\) is not guaranteed to be true, then \\( P \\) cannot be true because \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) would be violated.\n\nTherefore, if \\( Q \\) is not necessarily true, \\( P \\) must be false to avoid a contradiction with the first premise.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
