            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. **First Premise**: If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n   - Symbolically: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) is \"the banana was yellow\".\n\n2. **Second Premise**: The banana might not have been yellow.\n   - This means that it is possible that \\( B \\) is not true.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg B \\) is possible.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: The apple was not red.\n   - Symbolically: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion \\( \\neg A \\) necessarily follows from the premises \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\) is possible.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n- The first premise \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) states that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must be true.\n- The second premise suggests that \\( B \\) might not be true, which implies that \\( B \\) is not necessarily true.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the conclusion \\( \\neg A \\) must follow from the premises. Let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If \\( A \\) were true, then \\( B \\) would have to be true (from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)).\n- However, the second premise indicates that \\( B \\) might not be true, which means \\( B \\) is not guaranteed to be true.\n\nGiven that \\( B \\) is not guaranteed to be true, \\( A \\) cannot be true because if \\( A \\) were true, \\( B \\) would have to be true. Therefore, \\( A \\) must be false to satisfy the condition that \\( B \\) might not be true.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg A \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
