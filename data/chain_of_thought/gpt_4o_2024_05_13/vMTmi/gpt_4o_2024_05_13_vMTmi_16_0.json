            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( P_1: \\text{If } C \\text{ then } D \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( D \\) represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second premise states: \"The pants might not have been denim.\" This can be interpreted as:\n   - \\( P_2: \\neg D \\text{ is possible} \\)\n   - This means it is possible that \\( D \\) (the pants being denim) is not true.\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The shirt was not cotton.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( C: \\neg C \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion \\( \\neg C \\) necessarily follows from the premises \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\).\n\n- From \\( P_1 \\) (If \\( C \\) then \\( D \\)), we know that if the shirt is cotton (\\( C \\)), then the pants must be denim (\\( D \\)).\n- \\( P_2 \\) suggests that \\( D \\) (the pants being denim) might not be true. This implies that it is possible for \\( \\neg D \\) (the pants not being denim) to be true.\n\nFor the conclusion \\( \\neg C \\) (the shirt was not cotton) to be valid, we need to show that \\( C \\) (the shirt being cotton) leads to a contradiction with the premises.\n\n- If \\( C \\) were true, then according to \\( P_1 \\), \\( D \\) must also be true.\n- However, \\( P_2 \\) suggests that \\( D \\) might not be true, which means \\( D \\) is not necessarily true.\n\nSince \\( D \\) must be true if \\( C \\) is true (from \\( P_1 \\)), and \\( P_2 \\) allows for the possibility that \\( D \\) is not true, the only way to resolve this without contradiction is to conclude that \\( C \\) cannot be true. Therefore, \\( \\neg C \\) must be true.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg C \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P_1 \\) and \\( P_2 \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
