            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow T \\), where \\( C \\) represents \"the car was red\" and \\( T \\) represents \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The truck might not have been blue.\" This can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg T \\) is possible, meaning it is possible that \\( T \\) is false.\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The car was not red.\" This can be written as: \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if \\( \\neg C \\) necessarily follows from \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) and the possibility of \\( \\neg T \\).\n\n- From \\( C \\rightarrow T \\), we know that if \\( C \\) is true, then \\( T \\) must be true.\n- The second premise states that \\( T \\) might not be true, which means \\( \\neg T \\) is possible.\n\nIf \\( \\neg T \\) is possible, then \\( T \\) is not necessarily true. For \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) to hold, if \\( T \\) is not necessarily true, then \\( C \\) cannot be true. Therefore, \\( \\neg C \\) must be true to ensure the conditional \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) is not violated.\n\nThus, the conclusion \\( \\neg C \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
