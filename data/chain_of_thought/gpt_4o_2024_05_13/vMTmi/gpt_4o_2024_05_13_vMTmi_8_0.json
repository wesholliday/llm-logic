            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure and logical flow of the premises and the conclusion. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the premises and conclusion:**\n   - Premise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. (V \u2192 M)\n   - Premise 2: The mummy might not have been awake. (\u00acM is possible)\n   - Conclusion: The vampire was not awake. (\u00acV)\n\n2. **Translate the premises into logical statements:**\n   - Premise 1: V \u2192 M\n   - Premise 2: \u00acM is possible (This means that M is not necessarily true, so \u00acM could be true.)\n\n3. **Analyze the logical flow:**\n   - From Premise 1 (V \u2192 M), we know that if V is true, then M must be true.\n   - Premise 2 suggests that M might not be true (\u00acM is possible). This implies that M is not necessarily true, which means that V cannot be true because if V were true, M would have to be true (according to Premise 1).\n\n4. **Determine if the conclusion follows logically:**\n   - Given that \u00acM is possible, and knowing that V \u2192 M, if M were false (\u00acM), then V must also be false (\u00acV) to satisfy the implication V \u2192 M.\n   - Therefore, the conclusion \u00acV (the vampire was not awake) logically follows from the premises.\n\nSince the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
