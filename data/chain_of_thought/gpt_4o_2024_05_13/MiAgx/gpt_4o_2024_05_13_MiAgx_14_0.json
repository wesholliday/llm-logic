The original statement is: 'The blurble might be blurble for a flump and the wumble might be snizzle'.\n   - This means there is a possibility that the blurble is blurble for a flump.\n   - Additionally, there is a possibility that the wumble is snizzle.\n\n2. The inferred statement is: 'It might be that the blurble is blurble for a flump and the wumble is snizzle'.\n   - This means there is a possibility that both conditions (the blurble being blurble for a flump and the wumble being snizzle) are true simultaneously.\n\nThe original statement allows for the possibility of each condition independently, but it does not explicitly state that both conditions might be true at the same time. However, since it does not exclude the possibility of both being true simultaneously, it is reasonable to infer that it might be the case.\n\nTherefore, the inferred statement is logically consistent with the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
