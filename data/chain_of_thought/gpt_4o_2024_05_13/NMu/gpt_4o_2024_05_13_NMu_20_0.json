'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag':\n   - This means that it is not necessarily true that the sunglasses are in her bag. In other words, there is no requirement or certainty that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n2. 'The sunglasses might not be in her bag':\n   - This means that it is possible that the sunglasses are not in her bag. There is a chance that the sunglasses are elsewhere.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the necessity of the sunglasses being in her bag, it implies that there is a possibility that they are not in her bag. Therefore, the second statement logically follows from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
