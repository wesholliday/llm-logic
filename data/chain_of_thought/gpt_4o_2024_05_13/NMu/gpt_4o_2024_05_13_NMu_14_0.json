'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter':\n   - This means that it is not necessary for the milk to be on the counter.\n   - In other words, there is no requirement or obligation for the milk to be on the counter.\n\n2. 'The milk might not be on the counter':\n   - This means that it is possible for the milk to not be on the counter.\n   - It suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter.\n\nGiven that 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter' implies that the milk does not have to be on the counter, it opens up the possibility that the milk could be somewhere else. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that 'The milk might not be on the counter' because the lack of necessity for the milk to be on the counter allows for the possibility that it is not there.\n\nAnswer: yes",
