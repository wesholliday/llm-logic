'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest' means that it is not necessarily true that the griffin was in the forest. This implies that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\n2. 'The griffin might not have been in the forest' means that it is possible that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nSince the first statement indicates that it is not a certainty that the griffin was in the forest, it opens up the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. Therefore, we can infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
