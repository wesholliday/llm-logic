'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars' can be rephrased as 'It is not necessary that the alien visited Mars'. This means that the alien visiting Mars is not a requirement or a certainty.\n\n2. 'The alien might not have visited Mars' means that it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars. This statement allows for the possibility that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nIf it is not necessary for the alien to have visited Mars, then it is possible that the alien did not visit Mars. Therefore, the statement 'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars' implies that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
