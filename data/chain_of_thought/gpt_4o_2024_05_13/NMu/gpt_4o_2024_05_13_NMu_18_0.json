'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer' means that it is not necessary for the notebook to be in the drawer. This implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer.\n\n2. 'The notebook might not be in the drawer' means that it is possible for the notebook to be somewhere other than the drawer.\n\nSince the first statement indicates that it is not a requirement for the notebook to be in the drawer, it opens up the possibility that the notebook could be elsewhere. Therefore, the second statement logically follows from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
