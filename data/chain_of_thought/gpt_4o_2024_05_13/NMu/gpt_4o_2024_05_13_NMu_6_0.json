In other words, it is not a certainty that Sue chose pizza.\n\n2. **Inference: \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\"**\n   - This means that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between the two statements:\n\n- If it is not certain that Sue chose pizza (i.e., \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\"), then it leaves open the possibility that she might not have chosen pizza. This is because the negation of a necessity (must) implies the possibility of the opposite.\n\nTherefore, the original statement implies that it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
