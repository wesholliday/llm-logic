'It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser' means that it is not necessarily true that the watch is charging on the dresser. This implies that there is no requirement or necessity for the watch to be charging on the dresser.\n\n2. 'The watch might not be charging on the dresser' means that it is possible that the watch is not charging on the dresser. This statement allows for the possibility that the watch is either charging somewhere else or not charging at all.\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the necessity of the watch being on the dresser, it opens up the possibility that the watch could be elsewhere or not charging. Therefore, it aligns with the idea that the watch might not be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes",
