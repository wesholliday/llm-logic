In other words, there is no certainty that James wrote the book.\n\n2. **Inference: \"The book might not have been written by James.\"**\n   - This means that it is possible that James did not write the book. There is a possibility that someone else could be the author.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\n- If it is not necessarily true that James wrote the book, then it must be possible that James did not write the book. This aligns with the idea that there is a possibility (however small) that someone else could be the author.\n\nTherefore, the inference 'The book might not have been written by James' logically follows from the original statement 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
