'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt':\n   - This means it is not necessarily true that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n   - In other words, it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n2. 'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt':\n   - This means it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nBoth statements suggest the possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
