'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box':\n   - This means that it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box.\n   - In other words, the toy is not required to be in the toy box.\n\n2. 'The toy might not be in the toy box':\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nNow, let's analyze the relationship between these two statements:\n- If it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box, then it is possible that the toy is not in the toy box.\n- Therefore, the absence of necessity implies the possibility of the toy not being in the toy box.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can infer that if the toy is not required to be in the toy box, then it is possible that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
