The original statement is: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack.\"\n   - This means that it is not necessary for the scarf to be in the backpack. In other words, there is no requirement or obligation for the scarf to be in the backpack.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"The scarf might not be stuffed in my backpack.\"\n   - This means that it is possible for the scarf to not be in the backpack. There is a possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\n- If it is not necessary for the scarf to be in the backpack, then it is possible for the scarf to be somewhere else. This implies that there is a possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack.\n\nTherefore, the original statement logically allows for the possibility that the scarf is not in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes",
