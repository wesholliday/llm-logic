'It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair' means that it is not necessary for the jacket to be draped over the chair. This implies that there is no obligation or requirement for the jacket to be in that specific position.\n\n2. 'The jacket might not be draped over the chair' means that it is possible for the jacket to be in a position other than draped over the chair. This statement allows for the possibility that the jacket is not draped over the chair.\n\nSince the first statement indicates that it is not necessary for the jacket to be draped over the chair, it logically follows that there is a possibility (or might) that the jacket is not draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The jacket might not be draped over the chair' from 'It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
