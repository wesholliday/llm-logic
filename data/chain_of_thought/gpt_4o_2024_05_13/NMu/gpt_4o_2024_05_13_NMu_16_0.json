'It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag':\n   - This means that it is not necessarily true that the pen is in the bag.\n   - In other words, the pen is not required to be in the bag.\n\n2. 'The pen might not be in my bag':\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the pen is not in the bag.\n\nNow, if it is not necessarily true that the pen is in the bag, then it must be possible that the pen is not in the bag. Therefore, the statement 'It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag' implies that there is a possibility that the pen is not in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
