In other words, it is not a certainty that Jeff played basketball.\n\n2. **Inference: \"Jeff might not have played basketball.\"**\n   - This means that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between the two statements:\n\n- If it is not certain that Jeff played basketball, then it leaves open the possibility that he did not play basketball. This aligns with the idea that Jeff might not have played basketball.\n\nTherefore, the original statement implies that there is a possibility that Jeff did not play basketball, which matches the inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
