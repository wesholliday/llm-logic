'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race':\n   - This means it is not necessarily true that Alex finished the race.\n   - In other words, it is possible that Alex did not finish the race.\n\n2. 'Alex might not have finished the race':\n   - This means it is possible that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nSince both statements suggest the possibility that Alex did not finish the race, we can infer 'Alex might not have finished the race' from 'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
