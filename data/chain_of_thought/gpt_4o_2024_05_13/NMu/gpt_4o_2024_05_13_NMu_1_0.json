'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding':\n   - This means it is not necessarily true that Mary was at the wedding.\n   - In other words, it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n2. 'Mary might not have been at the wedding':\n   - This means it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nBoth statements suggest the possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. Therefore, the inference seems valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
