The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"It is not necessary that the banana was yellow.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"It is not true that the banana was necessarily yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is a conditional statement: \"If A (the apple was red), then B (the banana must have been yellow).\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The apple was not red\" from these statements.\n\nLet's denote:\n- A: The apple was red.\n- B: The banana must have been yellow.\n\nThe second statement can be written as: A \u2192 B (If A, then B).\n\nThe first statement can be interpreted as: \u00acB (It is not the case that B).\n\nNow, we have:\n1. \u00acB (It is not the case that the banana must have been yellow)\n2. A \u2192 B (If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow)\n\nTo infer \"The apple was not red\" (\u00acA), we can use the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- The contrapositive of A \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA (If not B, then not A).\n\nSince we have \u00acB from the first statement, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA\n\nGiven \u00acB, we can conclude \u00acA.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
