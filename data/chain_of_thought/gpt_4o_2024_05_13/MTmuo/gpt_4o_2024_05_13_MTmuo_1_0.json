The first statement is: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"It is not necessary that Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \u00ac(S), where S represents \"Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: M \u2192 S, where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we have \u00ac(S).\n- From the second statement, we have M \u2192 S.\n\nTo infer whether Mary was at the wedding or not, we need to consider the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive of M \u2192 S is \u00acS \u2192 \u00acM, which means \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nGiven \u00ac(S) (Sue was not at the wedding), we can use the contrapositive to infer \u00acM (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
