The first statement is: \"It's not the case that Chris must have finished the race.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"It is not necessary that Chris finished the race.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \u00ac\u25a1C (where \u25a1C means \"Chris must have finished the race\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: A \u2192 \u25a1C (where A means \"Alex finished the race\").\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acA (Alex did not finish the race) from these statements.\n\nLet's consider the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- The contrapositive of A \u2192 \u25a1C is \u00ac\u25a1C \u2192 \u00acA.\n- This means: \"If it is not necessary that Chris finished the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we have \u00ac\u25a1C.\n- According to the contrapositive of the second statement, \u00ac\u25a1C \u2192 \u00acA.\n- Since we have \u00ac\u25a1C, we can apply the contrapositive to infer \u00acA.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
