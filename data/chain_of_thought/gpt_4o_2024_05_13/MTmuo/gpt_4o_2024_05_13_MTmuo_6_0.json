The first statement is: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \u00ac(B), where B represents \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: S \u2192 B, where S represents \"Sue chose pizza.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acS (Sue did not choose pizza) from these statements.\n\nLet's use the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- The contrapositive of S \u2192 B is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acS.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have \u00acB.\n- According to the contrapositive, if \u00acB is true, then \u00acS must also be true.\n\nSince \u00acB is given, we can conclude \u00acS.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
