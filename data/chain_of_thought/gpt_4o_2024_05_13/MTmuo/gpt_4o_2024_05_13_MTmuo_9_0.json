The first statement is: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \u00acM, where M represents \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: L \u2192 M, where L represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \u00acL (Lisa did not buy the red shirt) from \u00acM and L \u2192 M.\n\n3. We know from the first statement that \u00acM is true.\n4. From the second statement, we have the implication L \u2192 M.\n\nIn logic, if we have an implication L \u2192 M and we know that M is false (\u00acM), we can infer that L must also be false (\u00acL). This is because if L were true, then M would have to be true to satisfy the implication L \u2192 M, but since M is false, L cannot be true.\n\nTherefore, from \u00acM and L \u2192 M, we can infer \u00acL.\n\nAnswer: yes",
