The first statement is: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"It is not necessary that Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"\u00ac(L)\" where L represents \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \"J \u2192 L\" where J represents \"Joe went to the park\" and L represents \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Joe did not go to the park\" (\u00acJ) from these statements.\n\n3. To infer \u00acJ, we need to see if J leads to a contradiction with the given statements.\n\n4. Assume J (Joe went to the park) is true.\n   - From the second statement (J \u2192 L), if J is true, then L must also be true.\n   - Therefore, if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo (L is true).\n\n5. However, the first statement tells us that it is not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo (\u00acL).\n   - This means L is false.\n\n6. We have a contradiction because assuming J leads to L being true, but we also have \u00acL from the first statement.\n\n7. Since assuming J leads to a contradiction, J must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: no",
