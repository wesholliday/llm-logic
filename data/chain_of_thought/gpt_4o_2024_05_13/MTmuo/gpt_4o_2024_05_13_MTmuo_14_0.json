The contrapositive of B \u2192 W is \u00acW \u2192 \u00acB. This means if the wolf was not necessarily in the den (\u00acW), then the bear was not in the cave (\u00acB).\n\nSince we have \u00acW from statement 1, and \u00acW \u2192 \u00acB from the contrapositive of statement 2, we can conclude \u00acB.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
