The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"It is not necessary that the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \u00ac(U), where U represents \"the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: G \u2192 U, where G represents \"the griffin was in the forest.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \u00acG (the griffin was not in the forest) from \u00acU and G \u2192 U.\n\n3. Let's assume for contradiction that G is true (the griffin was in the forest).\n   - According to the second statement (G \u2192 U), if G is true, then U must also be true.\n\n4. However, we know from the first statement that \u00acU is true (it is not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest).\n\n5. This leads to a contradiction because if G is true, then U must be true, but we have \u00acU (U is not true).\n\n6. Therefore, our assumption that G is true must be false.\n\n7. Hence, we can conclude that \u00acG (the griffin was not in the forest).\n\nAnswer: yes",
