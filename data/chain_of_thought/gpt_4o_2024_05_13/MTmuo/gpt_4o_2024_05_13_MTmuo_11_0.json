The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"It is not necessary that the muffins were blueberry.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"\u00ac(M)\" where M represents \"The muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \"C \u2192 M\" where C represents \"The cake was chocolate.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" (\u00acC) from these statements.\n\nTo do this, let's use the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- The contrapositive of \"C \u2192 M\" is \"\u00acM \u2192 \u00acC.\"\n\nWe already have \u00acM from the first statement. According to the contrapositive, if \u00acM is true, then \u00acC must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from \u00acM and the contrapositive of the second statement, we can infer \u00acC.\n\nAnswer: yes",
