The first statement is: \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"Erin did not necessarily take a train.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \u00ac(E), where E represents \"Erin must have taken a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: S \u2192 E, where S represents \"Sam took a plane\" and E represents \"Erin must have taken a train.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acS (Sam did not take a plane) from \u00acE and S \u2192 E.\n\n3. Let's consider the contrapositive of the second statement (S \u2192 E):\n   - The contrapositive of S \u2192 E is \u00acE \u2192 \u00acS.\n   - This means: \"If Erin did not necessarily take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\n4. We know from the first statement that \u00acE is true.\n   - Given \u00acE and the contrapositive \u00acE \u2192 \u00acS, we can conclude \u00acS.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
