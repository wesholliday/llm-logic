The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \u00ac(R)\n   - Where R represents \"the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: A \u2192 R\n   - Where A represents \"the alien visited Mars.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acA (the alien did not visit Mars) from \u00acR and A \u2192 R.\n\nLet's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- \u00acR means that it is not true that the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n- A \u2192 R means that if the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter.\n\nTo infer \u00acA from \u00acR and A \u2192 R, we can use the contrapositive of the implication A \u2192 R. The contrapositive of A \u2192 R is \u00acR \u2192 \u00acA, which means \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nSince we have \u00acR (the robot did not visit Jupiter), and the contrapositive \u00acR \u2192 \u00acA, we can conclude \u00acA (the alien did not visit Mars).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The alien did not visit Mars' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
