The first statement is: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"It is not necessary that Kate ate salad.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"\u00ac(K must have eaten salad)\" or \"\u00ac(K)\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \"B \u2192 K\"\n\nWe need to determine if 'Ben did not eat pasta' (\u00acB) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nLet's use the contrapositive of the second statement:\n- The contrapositive of \"B \u2192 K\" is \"\u00acK \u2192 \u00acB\"\n- This means: \"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nFrom the first statement, we have \"\u00ac(K must have eaten salad)\" which implies that it is possible that Kate did not eat salad (\u00acK).\n\nIf \u00acK is true, then from the contrapositive \"\u00acK \u2192 \u00acB\", we can infer \u00acB.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that 'Ben did not eat pasta' (\u00acB).\n\nAnswer: yes",
