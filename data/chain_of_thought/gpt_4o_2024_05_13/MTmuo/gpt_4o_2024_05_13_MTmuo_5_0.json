The first statement is: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"It is not necessary that Amy played tennis.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"\u00ac(A must have played tennis)\" or simply \"\u00acA\".\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \"If J, then A\" or \"J \u2192 A\".\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (\u00acJ) from these statements.\n\n3. To infer \u00acJ, we need to see if assuming J leads to a contradiction with the given statements.\n\n4. Assume J (Jeff played basketball).\n   - According to the second statement (J \u2192 A), if J is true, then A must be true.\n   - So, if J is true, then A must be true.\n\n5. However, the first statement tells us that \u00acA (Amy did not necessarily play tennis).\n\n6. If J leads to A, but we know \u00acA, then J cannot be true because it would contradict the first statement.\n\nTherefore, assuming J leads to a contradiction with the given statements. Hence, we can infer \u00acJ (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nAnswer: no",
