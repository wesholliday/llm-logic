            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The vampire was not awake' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"It is not necessary that the mummy was awake.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"\u00ac(Mummy must have been awake)\" or \"\u00ac(Mummy was awake).\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \"If Vampire was awake, then Mummy was awake\" or \"Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we have: \"\u00ac(Mummy was awake).\"\n- From the second statement, we have: \"Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake.\"\n\nTo infer whether the vampire was awake or not, we need to consider the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive of \"Vampire awake \u2192 Mummy awake\" is \"\u00ac(Mummy awake) \u2192 \u00ac(Vampire awake).\"\n\nGiven that \"\u00ac(Mummy awake)\" is true (from the first statement), we can use the contrapositive to infer that \"\u00ac(Vampire awake)\" is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
