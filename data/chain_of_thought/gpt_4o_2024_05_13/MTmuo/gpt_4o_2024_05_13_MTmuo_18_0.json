The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The truck was not necessarily metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement: If P (the doll was plastic), then Q (the truck must have been metal).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer 'The doll was not plastic' from these statements.\n\nLet's denote:\n- P: The doll was plastic.\n- Q: The truck must have been metal.\n\nThe second statement can be written as: P \u2192 Q.\n\nThe first statement can be written as: \u00acQ (The truck was not necessarily metal).\n\nWe need to check if \u00acP (The doll was not plastic) can be inferred from P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ.\n\nUsing the contrapositive of the conditional statement P \u2192 Q, we get:\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP.\n\nSince we have \u00acQ (The truck was not necessarily metal), we can use the contrapositive to infer \u00acP (The doll was not plastic).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The doll was not plastic' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
