It can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow E \\), where \\( S \\) represents \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( E \\) represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n3. **Negation of Erin taking a train:**\n   - From Statement 1, we have \\( \\neg E \\) (Erin did not take a train).\n\n4. **Contrapositive of the conditional statement:**\n   - The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) is \\( \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\). This means \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\n5. **Applying the contrapositive:**\n   - We know from Statement 1 that \\( \\neg E \\) is true.\n   - According to the contrapositive \\( \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), if \\( \\neg E \\) is true, then \\( \\neg S \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
