The first statement is: \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \u00acR (where R stands for \"The robot visited Jupiter\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be represented as: A \u2192 R (where A stands for \"The alien visited Mars\").\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acA (The alien did not visit Mars) from these statements.\n\nTo do this, let's use logical reasoning:\n\n- We know \u00acR (The robot did not visit Jupiter).\n- We also know A \u2192 R (If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter).\n\nIn logical terms, if A were true (the alien visited Mars), then R would have to be true (the robot visited Jupiter) because of the implication A \u2192 R. However, we know that R is false (\u00acR). \n\nIn logic, if A \u2192 R and \u00acR, then A must be false to avoid a contradiction. This is because if A were true, R would have to be true, which contradicts \u00acR.\n\nTherefore, A must be false.\n\nAnswer: no",
