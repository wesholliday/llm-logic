This means that if \\( L \\) is false, then \\( J \\) must also be false.\n\n4. **Applying the Contrapositive:**\n   - From Statement 1, we have \\( \\neg L \\) (Lucy did not go to the zoo).\n   - Using the contrapositive of Statement 2, \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\), and substituting \\( \\neg L \\) from Statement 1, we get \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
