It can be written in logical form as: \\( \\text{If } C \\text{ (car is red), then } T \\text{ (truck is blue)} \\).\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know \\( \\neg T \\) (the truck is not blue).\n- From Statement 2, we have \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) (if the car is red, then the truck is blue).\n\nTo infer whether 'The car was not red' (\\( \\neg C \\)), we need to see if assuming the car is red leads to a contradiction:\n\n- Assume \\( C \\) (the car is red).\n- According to Statement 2, if \\( C \\) is true, then \\( T \\) must be true (the truck must be blue).\n- But from Statement 1, we know \\( \\neg T \\) (the truck is not blue).\n\nThis leads to a contradiction because \\( T \\) and \\( \\neg T \\) cannot both be true. Therefore, our assumption that \\( C \\) (the car is red) must be false.\n\nThus, we can infer \\( \\neg C \\) (the car was not red).\n\nAnswer: yes",
