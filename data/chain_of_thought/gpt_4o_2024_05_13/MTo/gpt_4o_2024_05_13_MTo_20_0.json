            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"The apple was not red\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n   - This means the banana was some color other than yellow.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know the banana was not yellow.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the apple were red, the banana would have to be yellow.\n\nSince the banana is not yellow (Statement 1), the condition in Statement 2 cannot be true. Therefore, the apple cannot be red. If the apple were red, it would contradict the fact that the banana is not yellow.\n\nThus, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
