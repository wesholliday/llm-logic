This means that if \\( K \\) is false, then \\( B \\) must also be false.\n\n4. **Applying the Contrapositive:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know \\( \\neg K \\) (Kate did not eat the salad).\n   - Using the contrapositive \\( \\neg K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), and knowing \\( \\neg K \\) is true, we can infer \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that 'Ben did not eat pasta'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
