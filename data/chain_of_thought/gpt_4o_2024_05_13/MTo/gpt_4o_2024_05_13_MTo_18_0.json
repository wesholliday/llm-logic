            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"The truck was not metal.\"\n   - This means the truck is made of some material other than metal.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nNow, let's use these statements to see if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\n- From Statement 1, we know \\( \\neg Q \\) (the truck was not metal).\n- From Statement 2, we have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nIn logic, if we know \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\). This is known as the contrapositive rule, which states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true.\n\nApplying this rule:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) (The truck was not metal)\n\nFrom these, we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (The doll was not plastic).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
