In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we need to determine if 'Mary was not at the wedding' (i.e., \\( \\neg M \\)) can be inferred.\n\n3. **Logical Analysis:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding).\n   - From Statement 2, we have \\( M \\rightarrow S \\).\n\nIn logic, if we know \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\), we can use the contrapositive of the implication. The contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\n4. **Applying the Contrapositive:**\n   - We have \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n   - Since \\( \\neg S \\) is true (Sue was not at the wedding), we can infer \\( \\neg M \\) (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
