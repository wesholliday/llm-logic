            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n   - This means that the proposition \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is false.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( \\text{If } L \\text{ then } M \\), where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nGiven that \\( M \\) (Mark bought the blue shirt) is false, we need to determine the truth value of \\( L \\) (Lisa bought the red shirt) in the context of the conditional statement.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( \\text{If } L \\text{ then } M \\) is false only when \\( L \\) is true and \\( M \\) is false. Since we know \\( M \\) is false, for the conditional statement to hold true, \\( L \\) must also be false. If \\( L \\) were true, the conditional statement would be false, which contradicts the given information.\n\nTherefore, for the conditional statement to remain true given that \\( M \\) is false, \\( L \\) must be false.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
