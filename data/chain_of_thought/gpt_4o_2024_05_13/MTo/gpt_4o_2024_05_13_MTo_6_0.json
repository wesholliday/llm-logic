It can be written in logical form as: If \\( P \\) (Sue chose pizza), then \\( Q \\) (Bob chose pasta).\n\nWe need to determine if 'Sue did not choose pizza' can be inferred from these statements.\n\n3. **Logical Implication:**\n   - The conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If \\( P \\), then \\( Q \\)) is given.\n   - We also know \\( \\neg Q \\) (Bob did not choose pasta).\n\n4. **Contrapositive:**\n   - The contrapositive of the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza).\n\n5. **Applying the Contrapositive:**\n   - We have \\( \\neg Q \\) (Bob did not choose pasta).\n   - According to the contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), if Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg Q \\) and the contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg P \\) (Sue did not choose pizza).\n\nAnswer: yes",
