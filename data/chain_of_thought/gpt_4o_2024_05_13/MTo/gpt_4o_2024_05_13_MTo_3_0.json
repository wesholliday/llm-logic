It means that if James is the author, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to see if we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if James wrote the book, then it must be a mystery novel.\n- However, Statement 1 tells us that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nGiven these two pieces of information, we can use logical reasoning:\n\n- If the book were written by James, it would contradict Statement 1 because the book would have to be a mystery novel, but we know it is not.\n- Therefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nThus, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
