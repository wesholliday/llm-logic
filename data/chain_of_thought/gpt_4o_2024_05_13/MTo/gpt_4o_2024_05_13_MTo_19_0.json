            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n   - This means Jen did not engage in watching basketball.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\), where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n3. **Negation of \\( J \\):** From Statement 1, we know \\( \\neg J \\) (Jen did not watch basketball).\n\n4. **Contrapositive of the Conditional Statement:** The contrapositive of \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\). This means \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\n5. **Applying the Contrapositive:** Since we know \\( \\neg J \\) (Jen did not watch basketball), we can apply the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg T \\) (Tom did not watch football).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
