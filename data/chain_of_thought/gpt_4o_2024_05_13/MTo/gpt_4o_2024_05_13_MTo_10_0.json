It can be written as: If D (dog inside), then C (cat outside).\n\nNow, let's use these statements together:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know the cat was inside (not outside).\n- From Statement 2, we have a conditional: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n\nTo infer whether the dog was inside, we need to see if the given information leads to that conclusion:\n\n- If the dog were inside, according to Statement 2, the cat would have to be outside.\n- However, we know from Statement 1 that the cat was not outside (it was inside).\n\nThis creates a contradiction if we assume the dog was inside because it would imply the cat was outside, which contradicts Statement 1.\n\nTherefore, the dog cannot be inside, as it would lead to a contradiction with the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
