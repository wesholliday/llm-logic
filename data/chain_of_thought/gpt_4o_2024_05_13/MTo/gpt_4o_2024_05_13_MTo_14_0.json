The first statement is: \"The wolf was not in the den.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acW (where W represents \"The wolf was in the den\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   - This can be written as: B \u2192 W (where B represents \"The bear was in the cave\").\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acB (The bear was not in the cave) from these statements.\n\nLet's use logical reasoning:\n\n- We know \u00acW (The wolf was not in the den).\n- We also have the conditional statement B \u2192 W (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (B \u2192 W) and we know that the consequent (W) is false (\u00acW), we can infer that the antecedent (B) must also be false. This is known as modus tollens.\n\nSo, from B \u2192 W and \u00acW, we can infer \u00acB.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
