            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The shirt was not cotton' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"The pants were not denim.\"\n   - This tells us that the pants are made of some material other than denim.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It means that if the shirt is cotton, then it must follow that the pants are denim.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the shirt is cotton, then the pants must be denim.\n- However, from Statement 1, we know that the pants are not denim.\n\nGiven that the pants are not denim, the condition in Statement 2 cannot be satisfied if the shirt were cotton. Therefore, the shirt cannot be cotton because it would lead to a contradiction (the pants being denim, which they are not).\n\nThus, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
