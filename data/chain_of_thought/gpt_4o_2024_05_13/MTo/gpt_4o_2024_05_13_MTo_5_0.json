This means that if \\( A \\) is false, then \\( J \\) must also be false.\n\n4. **Using the Given Information:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know \\( \\neg A \\) (Amy did not play tennis).\n   - Using the contrapositive of Statement 2, \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\), and substituting \\( \\neg A \\) from Statement 1, we get \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
