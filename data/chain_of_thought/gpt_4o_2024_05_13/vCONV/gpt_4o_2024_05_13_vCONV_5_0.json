            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements involved.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n     where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( A \\rightarrow J \\)\n\nTo check the validity of the argument, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. \n\nIn propositional logic, the statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) does not imply \\( A \\rightarrow J \\). These two statements are not logically equivalent. The logical equivalence of \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is its contrapositive, which is \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) (if Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nSince \\( A \\rightarrow J \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow A \\), the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
