            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n     where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( J \\rightarrow T \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. \n\nIn propositional logic, the statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) does not imply \\( J \\rightarrow T \\). These two statements are not logically equivalent. The first statement (\\( T \\rightarrow J \\)) means that if \\( T \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must be true. However, the second statement (\\( J \\rightarrow T \\)) means that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( T \\) must be true. \n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Suppose \\( T \\) is false and \\( J \\) is true. The premise \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is true because a false statement implies anything.\n- However, the conclusion \\( J \\rightarrow T \\) would be false because a true statement does not imply a false statement.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
