The premise is: \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n     where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the case\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( W \\rightarrow B \\)\n\nTo determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. \n\nIn logic, an argument is valid if the conclusion must be true whenever the premises are true. \n\nLet's consider the logical relationship between \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) and \\( W \\rightarrow B \\):\n\n- \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) means that if \\( B \\) is true, then \\( W \\) must be true.\n- \\( W \\rightarrow B \\) means that if \\( W \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nThese two statements are not logically equivalent. The first statement (\\( B \\rightarrow W \\)) does not necessarily imply the second statement (\\( W \\rightarrow B \\)). \n\nTo illustrate this, consider a counterexample:\n- Suppose \\( B \\) is false and \\( W \\) is true.\n  - \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) would be true because a false antecedent makes the implication true regardless of the consequent.\n  - \\( W \\rightarrow B \\) would be false because a true antecedent with a false consequent makes the implication false.\n\nSince it is possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
