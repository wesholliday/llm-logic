            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( M \\rightarrow V \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. \n\n- The premise \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) means that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true.\n- The conclusion \\( M \\rightarrow V \\) means that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( V \\) must also be true.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the truth of the premise must guarantee the truth of the conclusion. \n\nLet's consider the truth table for both statements:\n\n| \\( V \\) | \\( M \\) | \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) | \\( M \\rightarrow V \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     | T                     |\n| T      | F      | F                     | T                     |\n| F      | T      | T                     | F                     |\n| F      | F      | T                     | T                     |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that there is a case where \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) is true (when \\( V \\) is false and \\( M \\) is true), but \\( M \\rightarrow V \\) is false (when \\( M \\) is true and \\( V \\) is false). This means that the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion in all cases.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
