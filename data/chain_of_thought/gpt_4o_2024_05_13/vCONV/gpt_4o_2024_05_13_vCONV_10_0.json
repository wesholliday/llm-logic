The premise is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \\( D \\rightarrow C' \\)\n     where \\( D \\) represents \"the dog was inside\" and \\( C' \\) represents \"the cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \\( C' \\rightarrow D \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. \n\nIn logical terms, the premise \\( D \\rightarrow C' \\) does not necessarily imply \\( C' \\rightarrow D \\). The logical implication \\( D \\rightarrow C' \\) means that if \\( D \\) is true, then \\( C' \\) must be true. However, it does not mean that if \\( C' \\) is true, then \\( D \\) must be true. \n\nThe correct logical equivalence would be the contrapositive of the premise, which is \\( \\neg C' \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) (if the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside). \n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( C' \\rightarrow D \\) does not logically follow from the premise \\( D \\rightarrow C' \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
