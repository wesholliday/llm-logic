            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( S \\rightarrow M \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise. \n\n- The premise \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) means that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n- The conclusion \\( S \\rightarrow M \\) means that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nFor the argument to be valid, the truth of the premise must guarantee the truth of the conclusion. \n\nLet's consider the truth table for the statements \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( S \\rightarrow M \\):\n\n| M | S | \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) | \\( S \\rightarrow M \\) |\n|---|---|----------------------|----------------------|\n| T | T | T                    | T                    |\n| T | F | F                    | T                    |\n| F | T | T                    | F                    |\n| F | F | T                    | T                    |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that there are cases where \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is true but \\( S \\rightarrow M \\) is false (specifically, when \\( M \\) is false and \\( S \\) is true).\n\nTherefore, the truth of the premise \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion \\( S \\rightarrow M \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
