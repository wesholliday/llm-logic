The premise is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be symbolized as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\"\n   - This can be symbolized as: \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) logically implies \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\).\n\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) means that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\) means that if \\( Q \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be true.\n\nHowever, the implication \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not necessarily imply \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). This is because the truth of \\( Q \\) does not guarantee the truth of \\( P \\). For example, there could be other reasons why the book is a mystery novel that do not involve James writing it.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\) does not logically follow from the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
