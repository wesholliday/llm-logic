From the first statement, \u00ac(P), we know that it is not true that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\n2. From the second statement, P \u2228 J, we know that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either P (the cookies must be hidden in the pantry) or J (the cookies are in the jar).\n\nGiven \u00ac(P), we know that P is false. Since P \u2228 J must be true and P is false, the only way for P \u2228 J to be true is if J is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that J (the cookies are in the jar) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
