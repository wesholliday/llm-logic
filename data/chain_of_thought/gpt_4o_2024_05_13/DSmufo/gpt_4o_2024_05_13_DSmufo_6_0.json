We have \u00acR, which means \"the phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\"\n2. We also have R \u2228 L, which means \"either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\"\n\nGiven \u00acR (the phone is not ringing in the kitchen), the disjunction R \u2228 L (either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room) simplifies to L because R is false.\n\nTherefore, if R is false, the only way for the disjunction R \u2228 L to be true is if L is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
