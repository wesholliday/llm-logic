The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The keys are not necessarily dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"It is not true that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\"\n   - This is a disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that \"The keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" is false.\n- Given the disjunction in the second statement, if one part of the disjunction is false, the other part must be true for the whole statement to hold.\n\nSince \"The keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" is false, the other part of the disjunction, \"The keys are in the drawer,\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
