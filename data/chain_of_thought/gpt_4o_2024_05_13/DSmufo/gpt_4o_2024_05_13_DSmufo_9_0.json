The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The missing puzzle piece is not necessarily blending in on the floor.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"It is not true that the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is a disjunction: \"The missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that \"The missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor.\"\n- From the second statement, we have: \"The missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box.\"\n\nGiven that the first statement negates the possibility of the puzzle piece blending in on the floor, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
