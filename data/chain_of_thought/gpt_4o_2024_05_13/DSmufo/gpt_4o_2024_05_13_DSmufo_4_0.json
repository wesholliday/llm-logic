The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"The cat is not necessarily playing in the bedroom.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"It is not true that the cat must be playing in the bedroom.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the cat must be playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"The cat is either playing in the bedroom or napping on the couch.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From the second statement, we have two possibilities: \n  1. The cat is playing in the bedroom.\n  2. The cat is napping on the couch.\n\n- The first statement tells us that it is not necessarily true that the cat is playing in the bedroom. This negates the certainty of the first possibility.\n\nGiven that the first possibility (the cat must be playing in the bedroom) is negated by the first statement, the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: yes",
