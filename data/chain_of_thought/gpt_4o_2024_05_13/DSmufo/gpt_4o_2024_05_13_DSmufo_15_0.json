We have \u00acP, which means P is false.\n2. We also have P \u2228 Q, which means at least one of P or Q must be true.\n3. Since P is false (from \u00acP), the only way for P \u2228 Q to be true is if Q is true.\n\nTherefore, given \u00acP and P \u2228 Q, we can infer that Q must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
