From the first statement, \u00ac(Fido must be in the garden), we know that it is not necessary for Fido to be in the garden.\n\n2. The second statement is a disjunction: (Fido must be in the garden) \u2228 (Fido is inside). This means that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\n3. Given that \u00ac(Fido must be in the garden) is true, the first part of the disjunction (Fido must be in the garden) is false.\n\n4. For the disjunction (Fido must be in the garden) \u2228 (Fido is inside) to be true, and since (Fido must be in the garden) is false, the second part of the disjunction (Fido is inside) must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis, we can infer that 'Fido is inside'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
