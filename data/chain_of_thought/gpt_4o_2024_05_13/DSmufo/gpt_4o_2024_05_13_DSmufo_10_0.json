The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The missing sock is not necessarily under the bed.\"\n   - In logical terms, this means: \"It is not true that the missing sock is under the bed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\"\n   - This can be rephrased as: \"The missing sock is either under the bed or in the laundry basket.\"\n   - In logical terms, this is an 'or' statement: \"The missing sock is under the bed OR the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that \"The missing sock is not under the bed.\"\n- From the second statement, we know that \"The missing sock is either under the bed or in the laundry basket.\"\n\nGiven that the sock is not under the bed (from the first statement), the only remaining possibility from the second statement is that the sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
