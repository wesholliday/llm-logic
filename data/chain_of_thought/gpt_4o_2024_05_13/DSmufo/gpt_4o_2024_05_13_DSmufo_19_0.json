We have \u00ac(W), which means \"the watch is not on his wrist.\"\n2. We also have W \u2228 C, which means \"either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nGiven \u00ac(W), we know that W is false. Since W \u2228 C is true and W is false, the only way for W \u2228 C to be true is if C is true.\n\nTherefore, from \u00ac(W) and (W \u2228 C), we can infer that C is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
