The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n   - This can be interpreted as: \"It is not necessary that the pen is on my desk.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \u00ac(P), where P represents \"The pen must be on my desk.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: P \u2228 Q, where P represents \"The pen must be on my desk\" and Q represents \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer Q (The pen is in my bag) from \u00acP and P \u2228 Q.\n\n3. From \u00acP (The pen is not necessarily on my desk), we know that P is false.\n4. Given P \u2228 Q (Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag), and knowing that P is false, the only way for the disjunction (P \u2228 Q) to be true is if Q is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis, we can infer that Q (The pen is in my bag) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
