            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"Sue was not at the wedding\" and \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) (if \\( M \\) then \\( S \\)) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) (if not \\( S \\) then not \\( M \\)).\n\n4. Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding' from 'If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
