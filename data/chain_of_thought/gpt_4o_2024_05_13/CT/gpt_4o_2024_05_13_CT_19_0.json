            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football' from 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg J \\) represents \"Jen did not watch basketball\" and \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\n3. The statement \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is the contrapositive of the original statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\).\n\n4. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football' from 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
