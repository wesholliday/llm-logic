            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n     - Where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\"\n     - And \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"Amy did not play tennis\"\n     - And \\( \\neg J \\) represents \"Jeff did not play basketball\"\n\n3. In logic, the statement \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is known as the contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow A \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is true, then \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball' from 'If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
