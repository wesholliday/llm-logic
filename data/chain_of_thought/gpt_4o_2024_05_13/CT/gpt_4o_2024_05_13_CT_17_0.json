            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta' from 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow K \\)\n     where \\( B \\) represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( K \\) represents \"Kate ate the salad.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n     where \\( \\neg K \\) represents \"Kate did not eat the salad\" and \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\n3. In logic, the statement \\( \\neg K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is the contrapositive of the original statement \\( B \\rightarrow K \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \\( B \\rightarrow K \\) is true, then \\( \\neg K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is also true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can indeed infer 'If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta' from 'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
