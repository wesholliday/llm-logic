The original statement is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"Bob did not choose pasta\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If P then Q) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (If not Q then not P).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
