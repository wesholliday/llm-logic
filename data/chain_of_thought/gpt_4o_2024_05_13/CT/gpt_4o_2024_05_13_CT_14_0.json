            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave' from 'If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg W \\) represents \"the wolf was not in the den\" and \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is the contrapositive of \\( B \\rightarrow W \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
