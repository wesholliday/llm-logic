The original statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"Chris did not finish the race\" and \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"Alex did not finish the race.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow C \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) from \\( A \\rightarrow C \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
