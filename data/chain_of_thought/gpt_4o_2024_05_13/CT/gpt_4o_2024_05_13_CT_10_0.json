The original statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n     where \\( D \\) represents \"the dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the cat was outside.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\)\n     where \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the cat was not outside\" and \\( \\neg D \\) represents \"the dog was not inside.\"\n\nIn logic, the statement \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) is the contrapositive of the original statement \\( D \\rightarrow C \\). The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
