            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton' from 'If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim', we need to understand the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow P \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( P \\) represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the pants were not denim\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow P \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
