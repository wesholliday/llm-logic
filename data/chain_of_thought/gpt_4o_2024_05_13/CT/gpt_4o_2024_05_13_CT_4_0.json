The original statement is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( B \\) is \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n     where \\( \\neg B \\) is \"the robot did not visit Jupiter\" and \\( \\neg A \\) is \"the alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nIn logic, \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow B \\). In classical logic, a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive. Therefore, if \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is true, then \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) must also be true.\n\nGiven that the original statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is true, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
