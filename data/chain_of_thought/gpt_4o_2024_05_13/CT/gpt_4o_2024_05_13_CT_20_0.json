            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red' from 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow', we need to understand the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is 'If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow'. This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is 'the apple was red' and \\( B \\) is 'the banana was yellow'.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red'. This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg B \\) is 'the banana was not yellow' and \\( \\neg A \\) is 'the apple was not red'.\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow B \\). The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
