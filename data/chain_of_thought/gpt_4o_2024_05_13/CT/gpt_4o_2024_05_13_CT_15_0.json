            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane' from 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow E \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( E \\) represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg E \\) represents \"Erin did not take a train\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"Sam did not take a plane.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow E \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane' from 'If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
