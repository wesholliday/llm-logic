            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake' from 'If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   - Where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"the mummy was not awake\" and \\( \\neg V \\) represents \"the vampire was not awake.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) (if \\( V \\) then \\( M \\)) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) (if not \\( M \\) then not \\( V \\)).\n\n4. Therefore, if we have \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), we can indeed infer \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
