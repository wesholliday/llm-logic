            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest' from 'If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n   - Where \\( G \\) represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg U \\) represents \"the unicorn was not in the forest\" and \\( \\neg G \\) represents \"the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) (if \\( G \\) then \\( U \\)) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\) (if not \\( U \\) then not \\( G \\)).\n\n4. Therefore, if the original statement \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) is true, its contrapositive \\( \\neg U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
