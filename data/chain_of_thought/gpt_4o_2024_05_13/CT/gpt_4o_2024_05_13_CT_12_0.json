            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow L \\)\n   - Where \\( J \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( L \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg L \\) represents \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" and \\( \\neg J \\) represents \"Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\n3. In logic, the statement \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is the contrapositive of the original statement \\( J \\rightarrow L \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) is true, then \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is also true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer 'If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park' from 'If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
