            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic' from 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"the doll was plastic\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was metal\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the truck was not metal\"\n     - And \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the doll was not plastic\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
