            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red' from 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue', we need to understand the logical relationship between these statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow T \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) represents \"the car was red\" and \\( T \\) represents \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"the truck was not blue\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the car was not red.\"\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n   - The contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) is \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\n4. A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the original statement \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is also true.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" we can infer \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
