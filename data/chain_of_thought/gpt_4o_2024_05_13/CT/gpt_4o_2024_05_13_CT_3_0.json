The original statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the book is not a mystery novel\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the book was not written by James.\"\n\nIn logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\)) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (if not \\( Q \\) then not \\( P \\)).\n\nTherefore, if we have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we can infer \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
