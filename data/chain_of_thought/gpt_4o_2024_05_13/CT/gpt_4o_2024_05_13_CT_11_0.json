            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate' from 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n     - Where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\"\n     - And \\( M \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"the muffins were not blueberry\"\n     - And \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the cake was not chocolate\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is the contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow M \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) is true, then \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) must also be true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer 'If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate' from 'If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
