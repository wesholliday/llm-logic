            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) is the contrapositive of \\( L \\rightarrow M \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) is true, then \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) is also true.\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
