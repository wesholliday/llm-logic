However, it does not imply that both outcomes can happen simultaneously. It simply indicates that either outcome is possible. \n\nTo infer \"The team might win the match and the team might lose the match\" from the original statement would be incorrect because it suggests that both outcomes are possible at the same time, which is not logically consistent. The correct interpretation is that one of the two outcomes will occur, but not both simultaneously.\n\nAnswer: no",
