The first statement is: \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( B \\lor S \\)\n     where \\( B \\) represents \"The fleeg is bluttered\" and \\( S \\) represents \"The fleeg must be surned.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fleeg might not be surned.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that the fleeg is not surned, but it does not definitively state that the fleeg is not surned. In logical terms, this can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg S \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\" (\\( B \\)), we need to see if the given information logically leads to \\( B \\).\n\n- From the first statement \\( B \\lor S \\), we know that at least one of \\( B \\) or \\( S \\) must be true.\n- The second statement suggests that \\( S \\) might not be true, but it does not definitively state that \\( S \\) is false.\n\nSince the second statement only indicates a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that \\( S \\) is false. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \\( B \\) must be true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
