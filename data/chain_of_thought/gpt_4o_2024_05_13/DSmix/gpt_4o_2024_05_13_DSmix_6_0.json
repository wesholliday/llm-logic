In logical terms, this means \\( \\neg \\text{Plopped} \\) is possible.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we have \\( \\text{Sploffed} \\lor \\text{Plopped} \\).\n- From Statement 2, we know that \\( \\neg \\text{Plopped} \\) is possible.\n\nIf \\( \\neg \\text{Plopped} \\) is true, then from the disjunction \\( \\text{Sploffed} \\lor \\text{Plopped} \\), the only way for the disjunction to hold true is if \\( \\text{Sploffed} \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, if the grommet is not plopped, it must be sploffed to satisfy the first statement.\n\nThus, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
