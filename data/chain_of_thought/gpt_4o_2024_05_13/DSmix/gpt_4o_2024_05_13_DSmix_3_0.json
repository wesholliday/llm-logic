The first statement is: \"Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( M \\lor Q \\)\n     where \\( M \\) represents \"the splat is morphed\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the splat is quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The splat might not be quanked.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that the splat is not quanked, but it does not definitively state that the splat is not quanked. In logical terms, this can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg Q \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer \"The splat is morphed\" (\\( M \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to \\( M \\).\n\n- From the first statement \\( M \\lor Q \\), we know that at least one of \\( M \\) or \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- The second statement suggests that \\( Q \\) might not be true, but it does not definitively state that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nSince the second statement only indicates a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively conclude that \\( Q \\) is false. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that \\( M \\) must be true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
