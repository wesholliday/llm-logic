However, the original statement allows for two possibilities: the quorple could be quazzle or it could be quorple. Since the statement does not exclude the possibility of the quorple being quazzle, we cannot definitively conclude that the quorple must be quorple.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The quorple must be quorple\" is not logically valid based on the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
