The blimple must be at the location called \"blimple.\"\n2. The blimple must be the entity called \"blimple.\"\n\nGiven the context of the original statement, it seems more likely that the intended meaning is about the location. Therefore, we need to determine if the blimple being at \"blimple\" is a valid inference.\n\nSince the original statement explicitly states that the blimple must be at either \"zooble grazzle\" or \"blimple,\" it is indeed possible for the blimple to be at \"blimple.\"\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The blimple must be blimple\" (interpreted as the blimple being at the location called \"blimple\") is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
