The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( S \\rightarrow P \\)\n   where \\( S \\) represents \"The shirt was cotton\" and \\( P \\) represents \"The pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The pants were denim.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( S \\) (The shirt was cotton) necessarily follows from \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nIn logic, the truth of \\( P \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( S \\). The conditional statement \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) only tells us that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( P \\) must be true. However, \\( P \\) being true does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( S \\). \\( P \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( S \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( S \\) is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
