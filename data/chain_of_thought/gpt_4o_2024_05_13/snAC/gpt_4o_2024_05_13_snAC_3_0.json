The first statement is a conditional: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The book was written by James) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot conclude \\( P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The truth of \\( Q \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\); there could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The book was written by James' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
