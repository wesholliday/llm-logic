            "content": "To determine whether 'Tom watched football' is necessarily true, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( J \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( T \\) (Tom watched football) is necessarily true given these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) does not provide information about the truth value of \\( T \\) if \\( J \\) is true. The truth table for a conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is as follows:\n\n| \\( T \\) | \\( J \\) | \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     |\n| T      | F      | F                     |\n| F      | T      | T                     |\n| F      | F      | T                     |\n\nFrom the truth table, we see that when \\( J \\) is true, \\( T \\) can be either true or false. Therefore, knowing that \\( J \\) is true does not allow us to conclude that \\( T \\) must be true.\n\nThus, it does not necessarily follow that 'Tom watched football' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
