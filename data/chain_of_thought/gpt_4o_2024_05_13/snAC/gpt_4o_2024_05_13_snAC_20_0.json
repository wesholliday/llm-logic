The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) is \"The apple was red\" and \\( B \\) is \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana was yellow.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( B \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( A \\) (The apple was red) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) does not imply that \\( A \\) is true just because \\( B \\) is true. The truth of \\( B \\) does not provide any information about the truth of \\( A \\). The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( A \\) were true, then \\( B \\) would be true. However, \\( B \\) being true does not mean that \\( A \\) must be true; \\( B \\) could be true for other reasons unrelated to \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that 'The apple was red' is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
