The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( L \\) (Lisa bought the red shirt) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) does not imply the converse \\( M \\rightarrow L \\). The truth of \\( M \\) alone does not provide information about the truth of \\( L \\). The conditional statement only tells us what happens if \\( L \\) is true, not what happens if \\( M \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, even though \\( M \\) is true, it does not necessarily mean that \\( L \\) is true. \\( L \\) could be true or false independently of \\( M \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
