The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be written as:\n   - If B (bear in the cave), then W (wolf in the den).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wolf was in the den.\" This can be written as:\n   - W (wolf in the den).\n\nWe need to determine if B (bear in the cave) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If B, then W\" does not imply that B is true just because W is true. The truth of W does not provide any information about the truth of B. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if B is true, not what happens if W is true.\n\nTherefore, even though W is true, it does not necessarily mean that B is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
