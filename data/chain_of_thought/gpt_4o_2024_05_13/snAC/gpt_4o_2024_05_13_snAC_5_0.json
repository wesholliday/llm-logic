The first statement is a conditional: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written as:\n   - If \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball), then \\( A \\) (Amy played tennis).\n   - Symbolically: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Amy played tennis.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( A \\) is true.\n\nWe need to determine if \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball) is necessarily true given these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) does not provide information about \\( J \\) if \\( A \\) is true. It only tells us that if \\( J \\) were true, then \\( A \\) would be true. However, \\( A \\) being true does not imply that \\( J \\) must be true. \\( A \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( J \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( J \\) is necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: no",
