The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Erin took a train.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Sam took a plane) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide information about \\( P \\) if \\( Q \\) is true. It only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not imply that \\( P \\) must be true. \\( Q \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( P \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( P \\) (Sam took a plane) is necessarily true just because \\( Q \\) (Erin took a train) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
