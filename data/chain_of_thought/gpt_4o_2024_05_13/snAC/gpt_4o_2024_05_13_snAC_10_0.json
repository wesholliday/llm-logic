The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( D \\) represents \"The dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"The cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cat was outside.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( C \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( D \\) (The dog was inside) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we are given:\n- \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n- \\( C \\)\n\nTo find out if \\( D \\) is true, we need to consider the implications of the given statements. The conditional statement \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) tells us that if \\( D \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be true. However, it does not tell us what happens if \\( C \\) is true independently of \\( D \\).\n\nThe truth of \\( C \\) (The cat was outside) does not provide any information about \\( D \\) (The dog was inside) because \\( C \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( D \\) is true or false. The conditional statement only restricts the situation where \\( D \\) is true, ensuring that \\( C \\) must also be true in that case.\n\nTherefore, the truth of \\( C \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( D \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
