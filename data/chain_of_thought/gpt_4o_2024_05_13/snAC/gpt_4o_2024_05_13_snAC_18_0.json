The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was metal.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (the doll was plastic) necessarily follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot conclude \\( P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The truth of \\( Q \\) (the truck was metal) does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) (the doll was plastic) is true. There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The doll was plastic' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
