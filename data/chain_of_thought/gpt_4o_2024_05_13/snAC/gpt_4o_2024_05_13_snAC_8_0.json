            "content": "To determine whether 'The vampire was awake' is necessarily true, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( V \\) represents \"The vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The mummy was awake.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( V \\) (the vampire was awake) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, the conditional \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) means that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if \\( M \\) is true. The truth of \\( M \\) alone does not imply the truth of \\( V \\). \n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- If the vampire was awake (\\( V \\)), then the mummy was awake (\\( M \\)).\n- The mummy was awake (\\( M \\)).\n\nFrom these, we cannot conclude that the vampire was awake (\\( V \\)). The mummy could have been awake regardless of whether the vampire was awake or not.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The vampire was awake' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
