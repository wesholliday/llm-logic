            "content": "To determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is necessarily true, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written as \\( S \\).\n\nWe need to determine if \\( M \\) (Mary was at the wedding) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) tells us that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must be true.\n- The statement \\( S \\) is true, but this does not provide any information about \\( M \\). The truth of \\( S \\) does not imply the truth of \\( M \\); it only confirms that \\( S \\) is true.\n\nIn logical terms, knowing \\( S \\) is true does not allow us to conclude \\( M \\) is true because \\( S \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( M \\) is true or false. The conditional statement only restricts the scenario where \\( M \\) is true, ensuring \\( S \\) must also be true in that case.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'Mary was at the wedding' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
