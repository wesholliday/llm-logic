The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply that \\( P \\) is true if \\( Q \\) is true. It only states that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would be true. The truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not provide information about the truth of \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, even though \\( Q \\) (Lucy went to the zoo) is true, it does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park) is true. \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons unrelated to \\( P \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
