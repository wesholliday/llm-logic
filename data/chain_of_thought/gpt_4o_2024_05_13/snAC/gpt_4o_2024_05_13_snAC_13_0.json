The first statement is a conditional: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was blue.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The car was red) necessarily follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply that \\( P \\) is true just because \\( Q \\) is true. The truth of \\( Q \\) (The truck was blue) does not provide any information about the truth of \\( P \\) (The car was red) on its own. The truck being blue could be true for reasons unrelated to the car being red.\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that 'The car was red' is true just because 'The truck was blue' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
