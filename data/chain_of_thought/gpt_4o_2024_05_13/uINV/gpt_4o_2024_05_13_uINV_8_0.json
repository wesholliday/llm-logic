            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake, we need to analyze the given statement and its logical implications.\n\nThe given statement is:\n\"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThis can be written in logical terms as:\nV \u2192 M\n(where V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake\")\n\nWe need to determine if the contrapositive of this statement holds true. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which means \"if not Q, then not P.\"\n\nFor our given statement, the contrapositive would be:\n\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV\n(which means \"if the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\")\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer:\n\u00acV \u2192 \u00acM\n(which means \"if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\")\n\nThe contrapositive (\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV) is logically equivalent to the original statement (V \u2192 M), but \u00acV \u2192 \u00acM is not necessarily true based on the original statement alone. The original statement does not provide information about what happens if the vampire is not awake.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \u00acV \u2192 \u00acM from V \u2192 M.\n\nAnswer: no",
