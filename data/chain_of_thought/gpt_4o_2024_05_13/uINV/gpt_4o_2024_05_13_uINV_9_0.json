            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statement.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical terms as:\n- \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\nwhere \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the contrapositive: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" In logical terms, this would be:\n- \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the statement \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( L \\rightarrow M \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
