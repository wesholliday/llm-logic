However, the contrapositive of A \u2192 B is actually \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA, not \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB.\n\nThe contrapositive of A \u2192 B (which is \u00acB \u2192 \u00acA) is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB is not logically equivalent to A \u2192 B.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \u00acA \u2192 \u00acB from A \u2192 B.\n\nAnswer: no",
