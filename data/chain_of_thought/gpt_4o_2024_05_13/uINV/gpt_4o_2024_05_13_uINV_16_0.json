The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of the given statement is:\n- If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\n- \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\n\nHowever, the statement we are asked to infer is:\n- If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n- \u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\n\nThis is not the contrapositive but rather the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
