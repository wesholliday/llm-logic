            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statement.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical terms as:\n\\[ J \\rightarrow A \\]\nwhere \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is:\n\\[ \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\]\nwhich means \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nHowever, the question asks whether we can infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis, which is:\n\\[ \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\]\n\nThis is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\). The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
