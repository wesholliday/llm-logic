            "content": "To determine if we can infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statement.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical terms as:\n- P \u2192 Q\nwhere P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nWe need to determine if the contrapositive of this statement holds true. The contrapositive of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which means \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer the inverse of the original statement, which is (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ), meaning \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n\nThe inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement (P \u2192 Q) does not provide enough information to conclude the inverse (\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nAnswer: no",
