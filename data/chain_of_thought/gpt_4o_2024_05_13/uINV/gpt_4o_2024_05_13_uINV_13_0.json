            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statement.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This can be written in logical terms as:\n- If P, then Q (where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\").\n\nThis is a conditional statement. The contrapositive of this statement is:\n- If not Q, then not P (If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red).\n\nThe contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the statement we are asked to infer is:\n- If not P, then not Q (If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue).\n\nThis is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
