The contrapositive of D \u2192 C is:\n\u00acC \u2192 \u00acD\nwhich means \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nHowever, the question asks us to infer:\n\"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\"\n\nThis can be written as:\n\u00acD \u2192 \u00acC\n\nTo determine if \u00acD \u2192 \u00acC is logically equivalent to D \u2192 C, we need to check if the original statement implies this. In logic, the statement \u00acD \u2192 \u00acC is not necessarily true based on D \u2192 C. The correct inference from D \u2192 C is its contrapositive \u00acC \u2192 \u00acD, not \u00acD \u2192 \u00acC.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
