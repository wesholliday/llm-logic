            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statement.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical terms as:\n- \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n  - Where \\( A \\) is \"the apple was red\"\n  - And \\( B \\) is \"the banana was yellow\"\n\nThe contrapositive of this statement is:\n- \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n  - Where \\( \\neg B \\) is \"the banana was not yellow\"\n  - And \\( \\neg A \\) is \"the apple was not red\"\n\nThe contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. However, the question asks if we can infer the inverse:\n- \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n  - Where \\( \\neg A \\) is \"the apple was not red\"\n  - And \\( \\neg B \\) is \"the banana was not yellow\"\n\nThe inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
