            "content": "To determine if we can infer that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal, we need to analyze the given statement and its logical implications.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n\nThis is a conditional statement, which can be written in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n- P: The doll was plastic.\n- Q: The truck was metal.\n\nIn logical terms, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is:\n- \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal,\" which is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\nThe inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
