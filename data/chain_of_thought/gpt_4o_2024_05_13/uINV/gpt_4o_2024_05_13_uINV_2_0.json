Therefore, if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest. This would be written as:\n\u00acG \u2192 \u00acU\n\nThis is the inverse of the original statement, not the contrapositive. The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
