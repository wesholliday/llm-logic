            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding, we need to analyze the given statement logically.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThis can be written in logical terms as:\nM \u2192 S\nwhere M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer:\n\u00acM \u2192 \u00acS\nwhere \u00acM represents \"Mary was not at the wedding\" and \u00acS represents \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\nIn logic, the statement \"M \u2192 S\" does not imply \"\u00acM \u2192 \u00acS.\" This is a common logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent. The correct contrapositive of the statement \"M \u2192 S\" is \"\u00acS \u2192 \u00acM,\" which means \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
