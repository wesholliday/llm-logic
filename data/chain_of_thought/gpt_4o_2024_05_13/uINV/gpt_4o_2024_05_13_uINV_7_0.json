The given statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The proposed inference is: \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"Alex did not finish the race\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) logically follows from \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), we need to understand the relationship between these two statements.\n   - The statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) means that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must also be true.\n   - However, \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is the contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow A \\), not \\( A \\rightarrow C \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), which means \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n   - This is logically equivalent to the original statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\).\n\n5. The proposed inference \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and does not logically follow from it.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
