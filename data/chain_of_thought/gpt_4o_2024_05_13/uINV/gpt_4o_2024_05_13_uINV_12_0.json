            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo, we need to analyze the given statement and its logical implications.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nThis can be written in logical terms as: \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\)\nwhere \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) is \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which means \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\" The contrapositive of a true statement is always true.\n\nHowever, the question asks if we can infer \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Z \\), which means \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nThis is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Z \\). The truth of the inverse is not guaranteed by the truth of the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer the inverse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
