It does not definitively state that the whiffle did not tink, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle must have tinked.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the whiffle was shanked, then it necessarily follows that the whiffle tinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the whiffle was shanked, then it must have tinked.\n- Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the whiffle did not tink.\n\nIf we combine these two pieces of information:\n- If the whiffle did not tink (as suggested as a possibility by Statement 1), then according to Statement 2, the whiffle could not have been shanked. This is because if the whiffle had been shanked, it would have had to tink, which contradicts the possibility that it did not tink.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that the whiffle did not tink implies that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
