The first statement is: \"The wug might not have been garpled.\"\n   - This means it is possible that the wug was not garpled. It does not definitively state that the wug was not garpled, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that being sproinged implies being garpled. In logical terms, if P (the wug was sproinged), then Q (the wug was garpled).\n\nTo infer 'The wug was not sproinged', we need to show that the wug being sproinged leads to a contradiction with the given information.\n\n- From the second statement, if the wug was sproinged (P), then it must have been garpled (Q).\n- The first statement suggests that it is possible that the wug was not garpled (\u00acQ).\n\nIf we assume the wug was sproinged (P), then according to the second statement, it must have been garpled (Q). However, this contradicts the possibility raised in the first statement that the wug might not have been garpled (\u00acQ).\n\nSince assuming the wug was sproinged leads to a contradiction with the possibility that it was not garpled, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
