However, it does not definitively state that the fleeg was not surned; it only suggests a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that being bluttered implies being surned. In logical terms, if \\( B \\) (bluttered) is true, then \\( S \\) (surned) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to see if we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the fleeg was bluttered, it must have been surned.\n- Statement 1 suggests that it is possible the fleeg was not surned. If the fleeg was not surned, then according to Statement 2, it could not have been bluttered (because bluttered implies surned).\n\nTherefore, if there is a possibility that the fleeg was not surned, it follows that the fleeg could not have been bluttered, because being bluttered would necessitate being surned.\n\nThus, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
