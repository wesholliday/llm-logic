It does not definitively state that the shank was not nugged, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the shank was plooked, then it is necessary that the shank was nugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that plooked implies nugged (Plooked \u2192 Nugged).\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the shank was not nugged (\u00acNugged is possible).\n\nIf \u00acNugged is possible, then by the contrapositive of the conditional statement (Plooked \u2192 Nugged), we can infer \u00acPlooked (not plooked). The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if Nugged is false (or possibly false), then Plooked must also be false.\n\nThus, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: no",
