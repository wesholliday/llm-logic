It tells us that vreebling the smonk guarantees that the smonk plagged.\n\nWe need to determine if 'The smonk was not vreebled' can be inferred from these statements.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the smonk did not plag. This does not give us a definitive answer about whether the smonk plagged or not; it only opens up the possibility that the smonk did not plag.\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged. This means that vreebling is a sufficient condition for plagging.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If the smonk was vreebled, then according to Statement 2, the smonk must have plagged.\n- However, Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the smonk did not plag.\n\nIf it is possible that the smonk did not plag, then it must be the case that the smonk was not vreebled. This is because if the smonk had been vreebled, it would have definitely plagged, contradicting the possibility that it did not plag.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the possibility that the smonk did not plag to hold true is if the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
