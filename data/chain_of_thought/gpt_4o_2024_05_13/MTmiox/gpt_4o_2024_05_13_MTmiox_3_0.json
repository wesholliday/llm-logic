It does not definitively state that the splat did not quank, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it necessarily quanked.\n\nTo infer 'The splat was not morphed,' we need to show that the splat being morphed leads to a contradiction with the given information.\n\n- From Statement 2, if the splat was morphed, then it must have quanked.\n- From Statement 1, it is possible that the splat did not quank.\n\nIf we assume the splat was morphed, then according to Statement 2, the splat must have quanked. However, Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the splat did not quank. This possibility would contradict the necessity of the splat quanking if it was morphed.\n\nTherefore, to avoid this contradiction, the splat cannot have been morphed. Hence, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
