It does not definitively state that the flugel was not zargled, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel must have been zargled.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that being blimmed is a sufficient condition for being zargled. In other words, if the flugel was blimmed, then it definitely was zargled.\n\nNow, let's consider the inference:\n\n- We know from Statement 1 that it is possible the flugel was not zargled.\n- From Statement 2, if the flugel was blimmed, it must have been zargled.\n\nIf the flugel was blimmed, then according to Statement 2, it must have been zargled. However, Statement 1 suggests that it is possible the flugel was not zargled. For these two statements to be consistent, the flugel cannot have been blimmed. If the flugel were blimmed, it would contradict the possibility raised in Statement 1 that the flugel might not have been zargled.\n\nTherefore, the only way for both statements to be true is if the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
