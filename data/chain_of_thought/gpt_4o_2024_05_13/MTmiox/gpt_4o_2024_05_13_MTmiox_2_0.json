It does not definitively state that the wug did not bim the zoint, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the wug was flooped, then it is certain that the wug bimmed the zoint.\n\nTo infer 'The wug was not flooped', we need to show that the wug being flooped leads to a contradiction with the information given.\n\n- From Statement 2, if the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n- However, Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\nIf we assume the wug was flooped:\n- According to Statement 2, the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\n- This would contradict the possibility mentioned in Statement 1 that the wug might not have bimmed the zoint.\n\nTherefore, to avoid this contradiction, the wug cannot be flooped. Hence, we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
