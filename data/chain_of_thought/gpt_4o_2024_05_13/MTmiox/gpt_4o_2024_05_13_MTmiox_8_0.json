            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"The sprocket might not have been daggled.\"\n   - This means it is possible that the sprocket was not daggled. It does not definitively state that the sprocket was not daggled, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that cranking the sprocket implies that it was daggled. In logical terms, if \\( C \\) represents \"the sprocket was cranked\" and \\( D \\) represents \"the sprocket was daggled,\" this statement can be written as \\( C \\rightarrow D \\).\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to see if we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\n- From Statement 2 (\\( C \\rightarrow D \\)), we know that if the sprocket was cranked, it must have been daggled.\n- Statement 1 tells us that it is possible that the sprocket was not daggled (\\( \\neg D \\) is possible).\n\nIf \\( \\neg D \\) (the sprocket was not daggled) is possible, then \\( C \\) (the sprocket was cranked) cannot be true because \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) would be violated. In other words, if the sprocket was cranked, it must have been daggled, but since it is possible that it was not daggled, it must be that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
