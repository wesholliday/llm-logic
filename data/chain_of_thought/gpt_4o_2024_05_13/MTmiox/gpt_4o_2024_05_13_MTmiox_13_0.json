It does not definitively state that the glip did not trag, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip must have tragged.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the glip was slogged, then it necessarily follows that the glip tragged.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the glip was slogged, then it must have tragged.\n- Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the glip did not trag.\n\nIf we combine these two pieces of information:\n- If the glip did not trag (as suggested might be possible by Statement 1), then according to Statement 2, the glip could not have been slogged. This is because if the glip had been slogged, it would have had to trag, which contradicts the possibility that it did not trag.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that the glip did not trag implies that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
