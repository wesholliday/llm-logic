It does not definitively state that the clug was not snugged, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the clug was fleeked, then it necessarily follows that the clug was snugged.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged.\n- Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the clug was not snugged.\n\nIf we combine these two pieces of information:\n- If the clug was fleeked, then it must have been snugged (Statement 2).\n- But there is a possibility that the clug was not snugged (Statement 1).\n\nFor these two statements to be consistent, the only way the clug might not have been snugged (as suggested by Statement 1) is if the clug was not fleeked. Because if the clug had been fleeked, it would have to be snugged, which contradicts the possibility raised in Statement 1.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked to maintain consistency between the two statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
