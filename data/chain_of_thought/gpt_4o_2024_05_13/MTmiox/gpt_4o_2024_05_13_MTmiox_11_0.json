It does not definitively state that the flug was not zimmed, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the flug was blummed, then it necessarily follows that the flug was zimmed.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n- Statement 1 suggests that it is possible that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nIf we combine these two pieces of information:\n- If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed (Statement 2).\n- But there is a possibility that the flug was not zimmed (Statement 1).\n\nGiven that there is a possibility that the flug was not zimmed, it would contradict the requirement in Statement 2 if the flug were blummed. Therefore, for the possibility in Statement 1 to hold true, the flug cannot have been blummed. \n\nThus, we can infer that the flug was not blummed to maintain consistency with the possibility that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
