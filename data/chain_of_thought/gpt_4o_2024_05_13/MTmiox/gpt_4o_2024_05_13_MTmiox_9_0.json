It does not definitively state that the twonk was not varnished, only that it is a possibility.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that being plinked implies being varnished. In logical terms, if P (the twonk was plinked), then Q (the twonk was varnished).\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the twonk was plinked (P), then it must have been varnished (Q).\n- From Statement 1, we know that it is possible that the twonk was not varnished (\u00acQ).\n\nTo infer whether the twonk was not plinked (\u00acP), we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement in Statement 2. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n- If the twonk was not varnished (\u00acQ), then it must be the case that the twonk was not plinked (\u00acP).\n\nSince Statement 1 allows for the possibility that the twonk was not varnished (\u00acQ), and the contrapositive of Statement 2 tells us that if the twonk was not varnished (\u00acQ), then it was not plinked (\u00acP), we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
