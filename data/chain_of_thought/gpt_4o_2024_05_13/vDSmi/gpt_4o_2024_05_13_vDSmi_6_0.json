However, the second premise only indicates a possibility (\\( \\neg Q \\) might be true), not a certainty. Therefore, it does not definitively rule out \\( Q \\). Since \\( Q \\) might still be true, \\( P \\) does not necessarily follow.\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion \\( P \\) does not necessarily follow from the premises given the possibility expressed in the second premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
