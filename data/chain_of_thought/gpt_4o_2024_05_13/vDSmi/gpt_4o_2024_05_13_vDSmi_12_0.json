However, the second premise only indicates a possibility (that \\( Q \\) might not be true), not a certainty. Therefore, it does not provide enough information to definitively conclude \\( P \\).\n\nThus, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no",
