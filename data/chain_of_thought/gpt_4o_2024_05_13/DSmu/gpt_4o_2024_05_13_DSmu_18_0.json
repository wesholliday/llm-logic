The first statement is: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"The notebook is in the drawer\" and \\( B \\) is \"The notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (The notebook is in the drawer) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the logical disjunction (OR) rule:\n- \\( A \\lor B \\) means that at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg B \\) (B is false):\n- If \\( B \\) is false, then for \\( A \\lor B \\) to be true, \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, if \\( B \\) is false, \\( A \\) must be true to satisfy the first statement.\n\nThus, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
