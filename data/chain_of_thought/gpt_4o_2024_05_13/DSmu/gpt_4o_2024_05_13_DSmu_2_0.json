The first statement is: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"The book is on the shelf\" and \\( B \\) is \"The book must be resting on the table.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( A \\) (The book is on the shelf) can be inferred from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and \\( \\neg B \\) (not \\( B \\)), we can conclude \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
