The first statement is: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\vee B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The toy is in the toy box\" and \\( B \\) is \"The toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (The toy is in the toy box) from these statements.\n\nUsing the logical disjunction (OR) rule:\n- \\( A \\vee B \\) means that at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) must be true.\n- Given \\( \\neg B \\) (B is false), the only way for \\( A \\vee B \\) to be true is if \\( A \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, if \\( B \\) is false, \\( A \\) must be true to satisfy the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
