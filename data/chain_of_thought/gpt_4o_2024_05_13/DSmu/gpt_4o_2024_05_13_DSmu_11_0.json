The first statement is: \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it must be sitting on the porch.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( D \\lor P \\)\n     where \\( D \\) represents \"The newspaper is in the driveway\" and \\( P \\) represents \"The newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( D \\) (the newspaper is in the driveway) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic:\n- From the first statement \\( D \\lor P \\), we know that at least one of \\( D \\) or \\( P \\) must be true.\n- From the second statement \\( \\neg P \\), we know that \\( P \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg P \\) (P is false), the disjunction \\( D \\lor P \\) can only be true if \\( D \\) is true. This is because in a disjunction (OR statement), if one part is false, the other part must be true for the whole statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, since \\( P \\) is false, \\( D \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
