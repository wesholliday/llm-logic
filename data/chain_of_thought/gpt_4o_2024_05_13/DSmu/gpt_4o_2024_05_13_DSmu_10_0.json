The first statement is: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket\" and \\( B \\) is \"The missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"It is not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we have \\( A \\lor B \\).\n- From the second statement, we have \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nIn logic, if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can infer \\( A \\). This is because if \\( B \\) is false, the only way for the disjunction \\( A \\lor B \\) to be true is if \\( A \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: yes",
