The first statement is: \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\" and \\( B \\) is \"The scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"It is not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( A \\) (The scarf is stuffed in my backpack) can be inferred from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logical inference, if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and \\( \\neg B \\) (not \\( B \\)), we can conclude \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, given:\n- \\( A \\lor B \\) (Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack)\n- \\( \\neg B \\) (It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack)\n\nWe can infer:\n- \\( A \\) (The scarf is stuffed in my backpack)\n\nAnswer: yes",
