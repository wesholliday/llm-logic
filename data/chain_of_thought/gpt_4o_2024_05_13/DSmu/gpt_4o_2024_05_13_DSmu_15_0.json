The first statement is: \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( C \\lor D \\)\n     - \\( C \\): The shoes are in the closet.\n     - \\( D \\): The shoes must be lined up by the door.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg D \\)\n     - \\( \\neg D \\): It is not true that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( C \\) (The shoes are in the closet) from \\( C \\lor D \\) and \\( \\neg D \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( C \\lor D \\) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\\( \\neg D \\)), then the other disjunct must be true.\n\n4. Given \\( C \\lor D \\) and \\( \\neg D \\):\n   - Since \\( D \\) is false, \\( C \\) must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they must be lined up by the door\" and \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door,\" we can infer that \"The shoes are in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
