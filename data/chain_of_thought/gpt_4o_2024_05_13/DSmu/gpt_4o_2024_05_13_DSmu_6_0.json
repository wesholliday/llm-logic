The first statement is: \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The phone is in the living room\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"It is not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( P \\) (The phone is in the living room) can be inferred from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\)) and \\( \\neg Q \\) (not \\( Q \\)), we can conclude \\( P \\).\n\n   - Given \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\))\n   - And \\( \\neg Q \\) (not \\( Q \\))\n   - By the rule of disjunctive syllogism, if one of the disjuncts is false (in this case, \\( Q \\)), the other disjunct must be true (in this case, \\( P \\)).\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the phone is in the living room or it must be ringing in the kitchen\" and \"It's not the case that the phone must be ringing in the kitchen,\" we can infer \"The phone is in the living room.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
