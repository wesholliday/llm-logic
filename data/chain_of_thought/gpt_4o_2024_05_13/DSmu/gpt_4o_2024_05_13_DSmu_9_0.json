The first statement is: \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"It is not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (The missing puzzle piece is in the box) from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\)) and \\( \\neg Q \\) (not \\( Q \\)), we can infer \\( P \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- \\( P \\)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
