The first statement is: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( S \\lor P \\)\n     - \\( S \\): The sunglasses are in her bag.\n     - \\( P \\): The sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - \\( \\neg P \\): It is not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The sunglasses are in her bag) from \\( S \\lor P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logical inference, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( S \\lor P \\) (either \\( S \\) or \\( P \\)) and \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)), we can infer \\( S \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S \\lor P \\)\n- \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nWe can infer:\n- \\( S \\)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the rules of inference, we can conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
