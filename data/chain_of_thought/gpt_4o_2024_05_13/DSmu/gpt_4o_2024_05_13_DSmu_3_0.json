The first statement is: \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\vee Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The keys are in the drawer\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( P \\) (the keys are in the drawer) can be inferred from \\( P \\vee Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( P \\vee Q \\) and we know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then \\( P \\) must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, given:\n- \\( P \\vee Q \\) (Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) (It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet)\n\nWe can infer:\n- \\( P \\) (The keys are in the drawer)\n\nAnswer: yes",
