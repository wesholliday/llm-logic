The first statement is: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The cookies are in the jar\" and \\( B \\) is \"The cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"It is not true that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (The cookies are in the jar) from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logical inference, if we have a disjunction \\( A \\lor B \\) and we know that \\( B \\) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), then \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can infer \\( A \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
