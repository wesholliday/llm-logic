The first statement is: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\vee B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" and \\( B \\) is \"The remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"It is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (The remote control is on the coffee table) from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( A \\vee B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and \\( \\neg B \\) (not \\( B \\)), we can infer \\( A \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\vee B \\)\n- \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- \\( A \\)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes",
