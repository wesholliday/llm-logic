The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Z \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park) can be concluded from these statements.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Z \\) must also be true.\n- The statement \\( Z \\) tells us that \\( Z \\) is true.\n\nHowever, knowing that \\( Z \\) is true does not provide any information about \\( P \\). The truth of \\( Z \\) does not imply the truth of \\( P \\); it only confirms that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Z \\) would be true, which is already given.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
