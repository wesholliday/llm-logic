The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The doll was plastic) logically follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot directly conclude \\( P \\). This is because \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\). The truth of \\( Q \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\); it only tells us that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would be true, but not the other way around.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude \"The doll was plastic\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
