The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Sue chose pizza) logically follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot directly conclude \\( P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true. There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Sue chose pizza based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
