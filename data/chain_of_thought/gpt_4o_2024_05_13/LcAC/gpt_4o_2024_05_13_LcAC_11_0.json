The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( C \\) (the cake was chocolate) logically follows from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\), we cannot directly conclude \\( C \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) only tells us what happens if \\( C \\) is true, but it does not provide information about what happens if \\( M \\) is true. \\( M \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( C \\) must be true; there could be other reasons why \\( M \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the cake was chocolate based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
