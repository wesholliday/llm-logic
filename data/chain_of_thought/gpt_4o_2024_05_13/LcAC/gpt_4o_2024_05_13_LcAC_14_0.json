The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If B (bear in the cave), then W (wolf in the den).\n   - Symbolically: B \u2192 W\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wolf was in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - W\n\nWe need to determine if we can conclude B (the bear was in the cave) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from a conditional statement (B \u2192 W) and the affirmation of the consequent (W), we cannot conclude the antecedent (B). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The truth of W does not necessarily imply the truth of B.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the bear was in the cave based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
