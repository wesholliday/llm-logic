The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n   - Where \\( V \\) represents \"The vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The mummy was awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( V \\) (The vampire was awake) can be logically concluded from \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\), we cannot directly conclude \\( V \\). The conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) only tells us that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true. However, knowing that \\( M \\) is true does not provide information about \\( V \\) because \\( M \\) could be true regardless of \\( V \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the vampire was awake based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
