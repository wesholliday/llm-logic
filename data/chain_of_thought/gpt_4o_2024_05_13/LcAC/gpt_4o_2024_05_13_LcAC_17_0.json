The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Kate ate salad.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Ben ate pasta) can be logically concluded from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply that \\( P \\) is true just because \\( Q \\) is true. The truth of \\( Q \\) (Kate ate salad) does not provide any information about the truth of \\( P \\) (Ben ate pasta). The conditional statement only tells us what happens if \\( P \\) is true, not that \\( P \\) must be true if \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" and \"Kate ate salad,\" we cannot logically conclude that \"Ben ate pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
