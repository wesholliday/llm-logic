The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The book was written by James) logically follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot conclude \\( P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The fact that \\( Q \\) is true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true; there could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that the book was written by James based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
