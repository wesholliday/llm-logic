The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( S \\rightarrow P \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"The shirt was cotton\" and \\( P \\) represents \"The pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( S \\) (The shirt was cotton) logically follows from \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( P \\), we cannot directly conclude \\( S \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) only tells us what happens if \\( S \\) is true, but it does not tell us that \\( S \\) must be true if \\( P \\) is true. There could be other reasons why \\( P \\) is true that do not involve \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude \"The shirt was cotton\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
