The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Erin took a train.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Sam took a plane) can be logically concluded from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot directly conclude \\( P \\). This is because the truth of \\( Q \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\). \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\).\n\nFor example, Erin could have taken a train regardless of whether Sam took a plane or not. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Sam took a plane, not that Erin taking a train means Sam took a plane.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Sam took a plane based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
