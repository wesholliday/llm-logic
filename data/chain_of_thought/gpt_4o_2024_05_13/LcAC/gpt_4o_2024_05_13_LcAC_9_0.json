The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( L \\) (Lisa bought the red shirt) logically follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) means that if \\( L \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must also be true. However, it does not imply that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( L \\) must be true. The truth of \\( M \\) alone does not provide information about the truth of \\( L \\).\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- If it rains, then the ground will be wet. (Conditional statement)\n- The ground is wet. (Given statement)\n- Can we conclude that it rained? No, because the ground could be wet for other reasons (e.g., someone watered the garden).\n\nSimilarly, in our case:\n- If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. (Conditional statement)\n- Mark bought the blue shirt. (Given statement)\n- Can we conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt? No, because Mark could have bought the blue shirt for reasons unrelated to Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
