The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"The apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( B \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( A \\) (The apple was red) logically follows from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\), we cannot conclude \\( A \\). This is because \\( B \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( A \\) being true. The truth of \\( B \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude \"The apple was red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
