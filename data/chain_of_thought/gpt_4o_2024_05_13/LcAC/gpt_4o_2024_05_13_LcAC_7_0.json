However, it does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( A \\) if \\( C \\) is true. In other words, \\( C \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( A \\) is true; it only means that if \\( A \\) were true, then \\( C \\) would be true as well.\n\nTherefore, from \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( C \\), we cannot conclude \\( A \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
