The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( M \\) (Mary was at the wedding) logically follows from \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( S \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( S \\), we cannot directly conclude \\( M \\). The conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) only tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding. It does not provide information about the situation where Sue was at the wedding independently of Mary.\n\nTherefore, the presence of Sue at the wedding does not necessarily imply the presence of Mary at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
