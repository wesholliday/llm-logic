The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Chris did not finish the race.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg A \\) (Alex did not finish the race) from these two statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) (If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race)\n- \\( \\neg C \\) (Chris did not finish the race)\n\nUsing the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) (If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg C \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- From \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) and \\( \\neg C \\), we can infer \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
