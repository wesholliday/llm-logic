The first statement is: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow R \\)\n     where \\( A \\) represents \"The alien visited Mars\" and \\( R \\) represents \"The robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg R \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg A \\) (The alien did not visit Mars) can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and \\( \\neg R \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of an implication \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) is \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\rightarrow R \\)\n- \\( \\neg R \\)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg R \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg R \\) is true, therefore \\( \\neg A \\) must also be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The alien did not visit Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
