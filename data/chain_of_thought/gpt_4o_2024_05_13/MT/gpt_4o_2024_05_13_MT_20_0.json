The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"The apple was red\" and \\( B \\) is \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg A \\) (The apple was not red) can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow)\n- \\( \\neg B \\) (The banana was not yellow)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) (If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red)\n\nSince \\( \\neg B \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg A \\) (The apple was not red)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
