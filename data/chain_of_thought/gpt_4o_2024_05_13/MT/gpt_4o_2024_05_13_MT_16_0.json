The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( S \\rightarrow P \\)\n   where \\( S \\) represents \"The shirt was cotton\" and \\( P \\) represents \"The pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The pants were not denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\)\n   where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"The pants were not denim.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg S \\) (The shirt was not cotton) from \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim)\n- \\( \\neg P \\) (The pants were not denim)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of the first statement, we have:\n- \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) (If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg P \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) and \\( \\neg P \\) together imply \\( \\neg S \\)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
