            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"The car was not red\" from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow T \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents \"The car was red\" and \\( T \\) represents \"The truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was not blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg T \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg C \\) (The car was not red) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) and \\( \\neg T \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) is \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) (If the car was red, then the truck was blue)\n- \\( \\neg T \\) (The truck was not blue)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) (If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red)\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg T \\) (The truck was not blue), we can apply the contrapositive:\n- From \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) and \\( \\neg T \\), we can infer \\( \\neg C \\) (The car was not red).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The car was not red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
