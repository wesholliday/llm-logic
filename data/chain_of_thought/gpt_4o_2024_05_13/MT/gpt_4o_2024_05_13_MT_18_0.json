            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic.\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was not metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from these statements.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nTo infer \\( \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n   - This means \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\n5. Given \\( \\neg Q \\) (\"The truck was not metal\"), we can apply the contrapositive:\n   - From \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
