            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n   where \\( G \\) represents \"The griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg U \\)\n   where \\( \\neg U \\) represents \"The unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg G \\) (The griffin was not in the forest) from \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\).\n\n4. According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens, if we have a conditional statement \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and we know that \\( \\neg U \\) is true, we can infer \\( \\neg G \\). Modus tollens states that if \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg G \\) must also be true.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest)\n   - \\( \\neg U \\) (The unicorn was not in the forest)\n   - Therefore, \\( \\neg G \\) (The griffin was not in the forest)\n\nThus, we can infer \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
