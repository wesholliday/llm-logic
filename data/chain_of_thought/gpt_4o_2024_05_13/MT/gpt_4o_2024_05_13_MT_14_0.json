The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n   where \\( B \\) represents \"The bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wolf was not in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( \\neg W \\)\n   where \\( \\neg W \\) represents \"The wolf was not in the den.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg B \\) (The bear was not in the cave) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) is \\( \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den)\n- \\( \\neg W \\) (The wolf was not in the den)\n\nUsing the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- \\( \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) (If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg W \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- From \\( \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) and \\( \\neg W \\), we can infer \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
