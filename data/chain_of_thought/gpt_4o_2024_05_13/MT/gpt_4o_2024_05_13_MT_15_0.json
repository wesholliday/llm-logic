            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Sam did not take a plane' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow E \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( E \\) represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Erin did not take a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg E \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg S \\) (Sam did not take a plane) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) and \\( \\neg E \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of an implication \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) is \\( \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S \\rightarrow E \\)\n- \\( \\neg E \\)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg E \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg E \\) is true, therefore \\( \\neg S \\) must also be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
