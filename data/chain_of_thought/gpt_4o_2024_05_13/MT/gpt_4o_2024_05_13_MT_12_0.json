            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Joe did not go to the park' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (Joe did not go to the park) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n4. In logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n5. Since we have \\( \\neg Q \\) (Lucy did not go to the zoo), and the contrapositive tells us that \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (Joe did not go to the park).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
