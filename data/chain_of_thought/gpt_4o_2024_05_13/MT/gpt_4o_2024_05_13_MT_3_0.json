The first statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg P \\) (The book was not written by James) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) (The book is not a mystery novel)\n\nFrom the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James)\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg Q \\), we can apply the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes",
