            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Tom did not watch football' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jen did not watch basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg J \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg T \\) (Tom did not watch football) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball)\n- \\( \\neg J \\) (Jen did not watch basketball)\n\nUsing the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) (If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg J \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- From \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) and \\( \\neg J \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg T \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
