The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n     - Where \\( D \\) represents \"The dog was inside.\"\n     - And \\( C \\) represents \"The cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cat was not outside.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"The cat was not outside.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( D \\) (The dog was inside) from \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) is \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) is:\n\\[ \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\]\n\nGiven \\( \\neg C \\) (The cat was not outside), we can apply the contrapositive:\n\\[ \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\]\n\nSince \\( \\neg C \\) is true, it follows that \\( \\neg D \\) must also be true.\n\n\\[ \\neg D \\] means \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The dog was not inside.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
