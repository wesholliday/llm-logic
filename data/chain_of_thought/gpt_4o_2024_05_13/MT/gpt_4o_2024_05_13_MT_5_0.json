            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'Jeff did not play basketball' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   - Where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball) can be inferred from \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of an implication \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis)\n- \\( \\neg A \\) (Amy did not play tennis)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) (If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball)\n\nSince \\( \\neg A \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg J \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
