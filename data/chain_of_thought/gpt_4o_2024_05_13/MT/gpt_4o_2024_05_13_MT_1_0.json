The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg S \\)\n   where \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg M \\) (Mary was not at the wedding) from these two statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can rewrite the first statement as:\n   \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n\nGiven \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding), we can apply the contrapositive:\n   Since \\( \\neg S \\) is true, \\( \\neg M \\) must also be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
