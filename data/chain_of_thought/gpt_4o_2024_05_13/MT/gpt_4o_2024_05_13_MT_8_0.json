            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"The vampire was not awake\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( V \\) represents \"The vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The mummy was not awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg V \\) (The vampire was not awake) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake)\n- \\( \\neg M \\) (The mummy was not awake)\n\nUsing the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) (If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg M \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- From \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can infer \\( \\neg V \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
