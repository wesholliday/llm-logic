The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \"Sue did not choose pizza\" from these statements.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nTo infer \\( \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can use the contrapositive of the conditional statement. The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). \n\n4. Let's rewrite the contrapositive:\n   - The contrapositive of \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n   - In logical form: \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n5. We are given \\( \\neg Q \\) (Bob did not choose pasta).\n\n6. According to the contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), if \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
