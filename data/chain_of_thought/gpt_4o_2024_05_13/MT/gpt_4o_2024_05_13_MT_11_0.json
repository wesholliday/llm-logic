            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents \"The cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The muffins were not blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg C \\) (The cake was not chocolate) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of an implication \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry)\n- \\( \\neg M \\) (The muffins were not blueberry)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) (If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate)\n\nSince \\( \\neg M \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n- \\( \\neg M \\) is true\n\nTherefore, \\( \\neg C \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
