            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg M \\)\n   where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg L \\) (Lisa did not buy the red shirt) can be inferred from \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt)\n- \\( \\neg M \\) (Mark did not buy the blue shirt)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of the first statement, we have:\n- \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) (If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg M \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg M \\) is true, therefore \\( \\neg L \\) must be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
