The first statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( \\neg L \\) (Lisa did not buy the red shirt) can be inferred from \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg L \\).\n   - The contrapositive of \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\).\n\n4. Given \\( \\neg M \\) (Mark did not buy the blue shirt), and using the contrapositive \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg L \\) (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
