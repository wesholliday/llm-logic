The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n     where \\( B \\) represents \"The bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"The wolf must have been in the den.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg W \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg B \\) (The bear was not in the cave) can be inferred from \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) and \\( \\neg W \\).\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n- From the conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow W \\), we know that if \\( B \\) is true, then \\( W \\) must be true.\n- The second statement \\( \\neg W \\) tells us that \\( W \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg W \\) (the wolf must not have been in the den), if \\( B \\) were true, then \\( W \\) would have to be true (according to the conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)). However, since \\( W \\) is false, \\( B \\) cannot be true. Therefore, \\( B \\) must be false.\n\nThus, we can infer \\( \\neg B \\) (The bear was not in the cave).\n\nAnswer: yes",
