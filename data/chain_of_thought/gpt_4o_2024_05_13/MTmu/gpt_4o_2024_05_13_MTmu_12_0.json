The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg Z \\)\n   where \\( \\neg Z \\) represents \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (Joe did not go to the park) from \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) and \\( \\neg Z \\).\n\n4. In logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) and we know that \\( Z \\) is false (\\( \\neg Z \\)), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) is \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n5. Since we have \\( \\neg Z \\) (Lucy did not go to the zoo), and the contrapositive tells us that \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (Joe did not go to the park).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
