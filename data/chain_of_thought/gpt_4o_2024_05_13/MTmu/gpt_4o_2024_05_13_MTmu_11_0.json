The first statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents \"the cake was chocolate\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg C \\) (the cake was not chocolate) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nIn logic, if we have \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nThe contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\nGiven \\( \\neg M \\) (the muffins must not have been blueberry), and using the contrapositive \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), we can infer \\( \\neg C \\) (the cake was not chocolate).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
