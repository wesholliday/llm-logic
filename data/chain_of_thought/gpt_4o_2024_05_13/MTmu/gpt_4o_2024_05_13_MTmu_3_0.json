The first statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( J \\) represents \"The book was written by James\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg J \\) (The book was not written by James) can be inferred from \\( J \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic:\n- From \\( J \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can use Modus Tollens, which states that if \\( J \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\) are true, then \\( \\neg J \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, given \\( J \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\), we can indeed infer \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
