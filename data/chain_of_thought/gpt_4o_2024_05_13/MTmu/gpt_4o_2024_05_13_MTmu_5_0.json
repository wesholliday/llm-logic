The first statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   - Where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy must have played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball) can be inferred from \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg J \\).\n   - The contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\).\n   - Since we have \\( \\neg A \\), we can apply the contrapositive to conclude \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
