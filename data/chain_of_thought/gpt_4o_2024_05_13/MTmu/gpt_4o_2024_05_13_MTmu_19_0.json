The first statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n     where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg J \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg T \\) (Tom did not watch football) can be inferred from \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of an implication \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n- \\( \\neg J \\)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n\nSince \\( \\neg J \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg T \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
