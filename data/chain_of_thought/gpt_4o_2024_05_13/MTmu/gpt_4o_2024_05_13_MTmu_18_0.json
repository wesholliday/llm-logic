The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"The truck must have been metal\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) means \"The truck was not necessarily metal\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (The doll was not plastic) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) (The truck was not necessarily metal)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):\n- \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (If the truck was not necessarily metal, then the doll was not plastic)\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg Q \\), we can apply the contrapositive:\n- From \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
