The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow E \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( E \\) represents \"Erin must have taken a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg E \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg E \\) represents \"It is not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( \\neg S \\) (Sam did not take a plane) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) and \\( \\neg E \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) is \\( \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) is:\n\\[ \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\]\n\nGiven \\( \\neg E \\) (It is not the case that Erin must have taken a train), we can use the contrapositive:\n\\[ \\neg E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\]\n\nSince \\( \\neg E \\) is true, we can infer \\( \\neg S \\) (Sam did not take a plane).\n\nAnswer: yes",
