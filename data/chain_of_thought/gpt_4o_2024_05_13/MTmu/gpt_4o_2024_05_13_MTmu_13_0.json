            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The car was not red' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow T \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents \"the car was red\" and \\( T \\) represents \"the truck must have been blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg T \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg C \\) (the car was not red) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) and \\( \\neg T \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) is \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C \\rightarrow T \\)\n- \\( \\neg T \\)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of the first statement, we have:\n- \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg T \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- If \\( \\neg T \\) is true, then \\( \\neg C \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \\( \\neg C \\) (the car was not red) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
