The first statement is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n     where \\( Q \\) is \"Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (Sue did not choose pizza) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logic, if we have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\nSince \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, we can infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
