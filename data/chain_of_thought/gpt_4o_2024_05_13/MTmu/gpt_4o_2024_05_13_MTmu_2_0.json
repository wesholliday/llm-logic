The first statement is a conditional statement:\n   - \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n     where \\( G \\) represents \"The griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"The unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second statement is:\n   - \"It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg U \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg G \\) (The griffin was not in the forest) from \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, particularly modus tollens:\n   - If we have \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\), we can infer \\( \\neg G \\).\n\nLet's apply modus tollens to our statements:\n- \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest)\n- \\( \\neg U \\) (It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest)\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n- \\( \\neg G \\) (The griffin was not in the forest)\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the application of modus tollens, we can indeed infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
