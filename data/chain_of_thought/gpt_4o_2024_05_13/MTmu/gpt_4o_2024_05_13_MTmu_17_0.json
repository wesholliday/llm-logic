The first statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten the salad.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow K \\)\n     where \\( B \\) represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( K \\) represents \"Kate must have eaten the salad.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Kate must have eaten the salad.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg K \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg B \\) (Ben did not eat pasta) can be inferred from \\( B \\rightarrow K \\) and \\( \\neg K \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of an implication \\( B \\rightarrow K \\) is \\( \\neg K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B \\rightarrow K \\)\n- \\( \\neg K \\)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n\nSince \\( \\neg K \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- If \\( \\neg K \\) is true, then \\( \\neg B \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from \\( \\neg K \\), we can infer \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
