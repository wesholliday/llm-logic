The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) is \"the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg A \\) (the apple was not red) can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nIn propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n- \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), we have:\n- \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg B \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg B \\) is true, therefore \\( \\neg A \\) must be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The apple was not red.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
