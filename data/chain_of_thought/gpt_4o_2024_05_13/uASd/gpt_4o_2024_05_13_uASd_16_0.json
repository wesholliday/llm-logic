Fertilizer alone cannot compensate for the lack of water.\n\n4. **Combining Conditions**:\n   - While fertilizing the lawn is beneficial, the absence of water due to a drought is a critical factor that can prevent the lawn from being lush and green.\n\nGiven these points, we cannot infer that the lawn will be lush and green if there is a drought, even if it is fertilized.\n\nAnswer: no",
