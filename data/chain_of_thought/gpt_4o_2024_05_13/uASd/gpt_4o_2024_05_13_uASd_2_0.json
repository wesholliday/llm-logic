The original statement is: \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time.\"\n2. This statement implies that attending the concert is sufficient for having a good time under normal circumstances.\n3. The new condition introduces an additional factor: \"if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off.\"\n\nWe need to consider whether the occurrence of a bomb going off would affect the outcome of having a good time. A bomb going off is a significant and likely negative event that would typically disrupt any positive experience, including a concert.\n\nTherefore, the presence of a bomb going off introduces a new variable that is not accounted for in the original statement. The original statement does not guarantee a good time under all possible circumstances, especially not under extreme and disruptive conditions like a bomb going off.\n\nAnswer: no",
