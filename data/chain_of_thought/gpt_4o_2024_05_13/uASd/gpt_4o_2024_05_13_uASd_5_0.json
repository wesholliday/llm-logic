A bounced check indicates that the payment was not successfully processed, meaning the bill is effectively not paid.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- The original statement only guarantees the continuation of services if the bill is paid.\n- If the check bounces, the payment is not valid, so the bill is not actually paid.\n\nSince the condition for the continuation of services (the bill being paid) is not met when the check bounces, we cannot infer that the services will continue.\n\nAnswer: no",
