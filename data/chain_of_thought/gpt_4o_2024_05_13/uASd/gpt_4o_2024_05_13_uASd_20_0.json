It could be less effective or potentially harmful.\n\n4. **Inference**: The initial statement does not provide information about the effectiveness or safety of expired medication. Therefore, we cannot directly infer that expired medication will have the same effect as non-expired medication.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Since the initial statement does not account for the condition of the medication (i.e., whether it is expired or not), we cannot infer that taking expired medication will make you feel better.\n\nAnswer: no",
