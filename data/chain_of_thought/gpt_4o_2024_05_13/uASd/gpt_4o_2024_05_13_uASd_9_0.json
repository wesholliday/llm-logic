            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that a well-written essay turned in late will result in an A, we need to analyze the given statement and the additional condition.\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement: If P, then Q.\n   - P: The essay is well-written.\n   - Q: The student will get an A.\n\n2. The additional condition is: \"The essay is well-written and turned in late.\"\n   - This introduces a new factor: the essay being turned in late.\n\n3. The original statement does not mention anything about the timing of the submission. It only specifies that a well-written essay will result in an A.\n\n4. However, the introduction of the essay being turned in late could potentially affect the outcome. Many academic settings have policies where late submissions can result in penalties, regardless of the quality of the work.\n\n5. Since the original statement does not account for the timing of the submission, and we know that late submissions can often lead to penalties, we cannot definitively infer that a well-written essay turned in late will result in an A.\n\nAnswer: no",
