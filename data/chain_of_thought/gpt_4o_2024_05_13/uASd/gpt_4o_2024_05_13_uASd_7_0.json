The given statement is: \"If the oven is on, then the kitchen is warm.\"\n   - This can be written as: Oven on \u2192 Kitchen warm.\n\n2. We need to determine if the statement \"If the oven is on and the pilot light is out, then the kitchen is warm\" can be inferred from the given information.\n   - This can be written as: (Oven on \u2227 Pilot light out) \u2192 Kitchen warm.\n\n3. The original statement does not mention anything about the pilot light. It only states that if the oven is on, the kitchen is warm. The condition of the pilot light is not relevant to the given implication.\n\n4. Since the original statement guarantees that the kitchen is warm whenever the oven is on, the additional information about the pilot light being out does not change the fact that the oven being on implies the kitchen is warm.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the oven is on and the pilot light is out, the kitchen is still warm based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
