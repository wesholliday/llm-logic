The given statement is: \"If the car is in the garage, then it is safe.\"\n   - This implies that the condition of the car being in the garage is sufficient for the car to be safe under normal circumstances.\n\n2. We need to evaluate the scenario where the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding.\n   - The original statement does not account for additional conditions such as flooding.\n   - Flooding introduces a new variable that could potentially affect the safety of the car.\n\n3. The original statement only guarantees the car's safety based on its presence in the garage, without considering other factors like flooding.\n\n4. Since flooding is an abnormal condition that could compromise the safety of the car, we cannot rely solely on the original statement to infer the car's safety in this new scenario.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the car is safe if it is in the garage and the garage is flooding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
