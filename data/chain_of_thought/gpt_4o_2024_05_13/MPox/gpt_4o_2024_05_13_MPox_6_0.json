It tells us that if the grommet was sploffed, then as a consequence, the grommet plopped the frink.\n\n3. **Logical Inference:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that the grommet was sploffed.\n   - According to Statement 2, if the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\n   - Since the condition (the grommet was sploffed) is met, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can infer that the grommet plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: yes",
