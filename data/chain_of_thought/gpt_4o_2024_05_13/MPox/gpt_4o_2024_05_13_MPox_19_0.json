It tells us that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must follow that the smonk plagged.\n\n3. **Logical Deduction:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that the smonk was vreebled.\n   - According to Statement 2, if the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\n   - Since the condition (the smonk was vreebled) is met, we can apply the conditional statement to conclude that the smonk plagged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can infer that 'The smonk plagged.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
