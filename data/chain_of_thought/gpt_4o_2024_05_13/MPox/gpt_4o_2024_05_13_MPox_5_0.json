The first statement is: \"The zinger was fraggled.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\) (where \\( P \\) stands for \"The zinger was fraggled\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (where \\( Q \\) stands for \"The zinger was smoogled\").\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( Q \\) (\"The zinger was smoogled\") from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we have:\n- \\( P \\)\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n\nFrom these two premises, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if \\( P \\) is true and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\nSince:\n- \\( P \\) is given as true (\"The zinger was fraggled\").\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is given as true (\"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\").\n\nBy modus ponens, we can conclude that \\( Q \\) is true (\"The zinger was smoogled\").\n\nAnswer: yes",
