The first statement is: \"The sprocket was cranked.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in the form: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"The sprocket was cranked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\) (The sprocket was cranked)\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled)\n\nIn logical terms, if \\( P \\) is true and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\nSince we are given that \\( P \\) is true (\"The sprocket was cranked\") and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true (\"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\"), we can infer that \\( Q \\) is true (\"The sprocket was daggled\").\n\nAnswer: yes",
