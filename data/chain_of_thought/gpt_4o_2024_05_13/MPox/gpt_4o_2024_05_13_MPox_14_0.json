It means that if the clug was fleeked, then it must follow that the clug snugged.\n\n3. **Combining the Statements:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that the clug was fleeked.\n   - According to Statement 2, if the clug was fleeked (which it is), then the clug snugged.\n\nSince both conditions are satisfied (the clug was fleeked and the conditional statement applies), we can logically infer that \"The clug snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
