The first statement is: \"The wug was sproinged.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n\nWe need to determine if 'It was garpled' logically follows from these statements.\n\n1. From the first statement, we know that the wug was indeed sproinged.\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement: If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n\nSince the first statement confirms that the wug was sproinged, we can apply the conditional statement. According to the conditional statement, if the wug was sproinged (which it was), then it must have been garpled.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that 'It was garpled.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
