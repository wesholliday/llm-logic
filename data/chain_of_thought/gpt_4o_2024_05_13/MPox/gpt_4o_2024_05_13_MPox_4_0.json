The first statement is: \"The fribble was snurgled.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n\nWe need to determine if \"The fribble crinked\" can be inferred from these two statements.\n\n- The first statement asserts that the fribble was indeed snurgled.\n- The second statement is a conditional statement that says if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n\nGiven that the fribble was snurgled (from the first statement), we can apply the conditional statement (the second statement). According to the conditional statement, if the fribble was snurgled, then it follows that the fribble crinked.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the fribble crinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
