The first statement is: \"The whiffle was shanked.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nIn formal logic, the second statement can be written as:\n- If P, then Q (where P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q is \"the whiffle tinked\").\n\nGiven:\n- P (The whiffle was shanked)\n- If P, then Q (If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the rule of modus ponens, which states that if \"P\" is true and \"If P then Q\" is true, then \"Q\" must also be true.\n\nSince:\n- P is true (\"The whiffle was shanked\")\n- If P then Q is true (\"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\")\n\nWe can conclude:\n- Q is true (\"The whiffle tinked\")\n\nAnswer: yes",
