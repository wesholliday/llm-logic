It tells us that if the glip was slogged, then it must also be the case that the glip was tragged.\n\n3. **Logical Inference:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that the glip was slogged.\n   - According to Statement 2, if the glip was slogged, then it follows that the glip was tragged.\n\nSince both conditions are met (the glip was slogged and the conditional statement applies), we can logically infer that the glip was tragged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
