It means that if the condition \"the flug was blummed\" is true, then the condition \"the flug was zimmed\" must also be true.\n\n3. **Applying the Conditional Statement:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that \"the flug was blummed\" is true.\n   - According to Statement 2, if \"the flug was blummed\" is true, then \"the flug was zimmed\" must also be true.\n\nSince both statements together logically lead us to the conclusion that \"the flug was zimmed,\" we can infer this conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
