The first statement is: \"The flugel was blimmed.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nWe can represent these statements in logical form:\n1. \\( P \\) (The flugel was blimmed)\n2. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled)\n\nIn logic, if we know that \\( P \\) is true and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, we can use modus ponens to conclude that \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\) is true (The flugel was blimmed)\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true (If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled)\n\nBy modus ponens:\n- \\( Q \\) must be true (The flugel was zargled)\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The flugel was zargled' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
