It means that if the fleeg being bluttered is true, then the fleeg surned must also be true.\n\nGiven that the first statement confirms the fleeg was indeed bluttered, we can apply the conditional statement from the second statement. Since the condition (the fleeg was bluttered) is met, the conclusion (the fleeg surned) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure of the statements, we can infer that 'The fleeg surned.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
