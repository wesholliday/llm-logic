The first statement is: 'The smip was shripped.'\n2. The second statement is: 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.'\n\nThe second statement is a conditional statement, which can be written in the form: \n- If P, then Q.\n\nWhere:\n- P is 'The smip was shripped.'\n- Q is 'The smip lupped the zoint.'\n\nAccording to the first statement, P ('The smip was shripped') is true.\n\nIn a conditional statement, if the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\nSince P is true, we can conclude that Q ('The smip lupped the zoint') is also true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The smip lupped the zoint.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
