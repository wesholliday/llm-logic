            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The sneg sproted the frink' from the given statements, let's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** 'The sneg was crampled.'\n   - This is a straightforward assertion that the sneg was in a state described as 'crampled.'\n\n2. **Statement 2:** 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.'\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the sneg was in the state of being 'crampled,' then it follows that the sneg 'sproted the frink.'\n\n3. **Logical Inference:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that the sneg was indeed crampled.\n   - According to Statement 2, if the sneg was crampled (which we know it was), then it must be true that the sneg 'sproted the frink.'\n\nSince both statements together provide a condition and confirm that the condition is met, we can logically infer the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
