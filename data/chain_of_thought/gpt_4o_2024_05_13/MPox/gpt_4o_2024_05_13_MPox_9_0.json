It means that being plinked is a sufficient condition for being varnished. In other words, if the twonk is plinked, then it must also be varnished.\n\n3. **Inference:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that the twonk was indeed plinked.\n   - According to Statement 2, if the twonk was plinked, then it must be varnished.\n   - Since we have established that the twonk was plinked (from Statement 1), we can apply the conditional statement (Statement 2) to conclude that the twonk was varnished.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"It was varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
