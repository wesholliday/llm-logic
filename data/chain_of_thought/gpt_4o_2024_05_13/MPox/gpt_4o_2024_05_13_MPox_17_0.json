It means that if the flob being skizzled is true, then the flob movating must also be true.\n\n3. **Combining the Statements:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that the flob was indeed skizzled.\n   - According to Statement 2, if the flob was skizzled (which it was), then it follows that the flob movated.\n\nSince both statements together logically lead to the conclusion that the flob movated, we can infer \"The flob movated.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
