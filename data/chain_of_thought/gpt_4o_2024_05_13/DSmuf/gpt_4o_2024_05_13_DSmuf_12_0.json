The first statement is: \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( J \\lor C \\), where \\( J \\) represents \"the jacket is hanging in the closet\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the jacket must be hanging in the closet.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg J \\), where \\( \\neg J \\) means \"the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\"\n\nNow, let's combine these two statements:\n\n- From the first statement, we have \\( J \\lor C \\).\n- From the second statement, we have \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nIn logic, if we have \\( J \\lor C \\) and \\( \\neg J \\), we can infer \\( C \\). This is because if \\( J \\) is false (as given by \\( \\neg J \\)), then for the disjunction \\( J \\lor C \\) to be true, \\( C \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
