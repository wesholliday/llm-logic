The first statement is: \"Either the sunglasses must be perched on her head or they are in her bag.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor B \\)\n     - \\( P \\): The sunglasses are perched on her head.\n     - \\( B \\): The sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - \\( \\neg P \\): The sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (The sunglasses are in her bag) from \\( P \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logical inference:\n   - From \\( P \\lor B \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( B \\) is true) and \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)), we can conclude \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the given statements, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
