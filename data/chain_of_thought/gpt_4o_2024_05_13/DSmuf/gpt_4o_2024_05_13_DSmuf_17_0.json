The first statement is: \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"The scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) means \"It is not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( Q \\) (The scarf is stuffed in my backpack) can be inferred from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\)) and \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)), we can infer \\( Q \\) (the other option must be true).\n\nLet's apply this to our statements:\n- We have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack).\n- We also have \\( \\neg P \\) (It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack).\n\nGiven \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we can logically infer \\( Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
