The first statement is: \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" and \\( B \\) is \"the remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg A \\) means \"it is not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( B \\) (the remote control is on the coffee table) can be inferred from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logical inference, if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and \\( \\neg A \\) (not \\( A \\)), we can conclude \\( B \\).\n\nTherefore, given the statements:\n- \\( A \\lor B \\)\n- \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nWe can infer \\( B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
