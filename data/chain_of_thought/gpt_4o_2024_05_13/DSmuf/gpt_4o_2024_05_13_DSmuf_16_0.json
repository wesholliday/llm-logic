The first statement is: \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"The pen must be on my desk.\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) means \"It is not the case that the pen must be on my desk.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( Q \\) (The pen is in my bag) can be inferred from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\)) and \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)), we can infer \\( Q \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- \\( Q \\)\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag\" and \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk,\" we can infer \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
