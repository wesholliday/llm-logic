The first statement is: \"Either the watch must be on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( W \\lor C \\)\n     - Where \\( W \\) stands for \"the watch is on his wrist\"\n     - And \\( C \\) stands for \"the watch is charging on the dresser\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg W \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg W \\) means \"the watch is not on his wrist\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( C \\) (the watch is charging on the dresser) from \\( W \\lor C \\) and \\( \\neg W \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( W \\lor C \\) (either \\( W \\) or \\( C \\))\n   - And we have \\( \\neg W \\) (not \\( W \\))\n   - Then we can conclude \\( C \\) (the other disjunct must be true)\n\nTherefore, given \\( W \\lor C \\) and \\( \\neg W \\), we can logically infer \\( C \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
