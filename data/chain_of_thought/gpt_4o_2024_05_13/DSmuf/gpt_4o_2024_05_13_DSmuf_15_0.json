The first statement is: \"Either the shoes must be lined up by the door or they are in the closet.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The shoes must be lined up by the door\" and \\( B \\) is \"The shoes are in the closet.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg A \\) means \"It is not the case that the shoes must be lined up by the door.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (The shoes are in the closet) from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and \\( \\neg A \\) (not \\( A \\)), we can conclude \\( B \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\lor B \\)\n- \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nWe can infer:\n- \\( B \\)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that \"The shoes are in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
