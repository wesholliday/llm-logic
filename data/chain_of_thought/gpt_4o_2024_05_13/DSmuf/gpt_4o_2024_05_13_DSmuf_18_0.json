The first statement is: \"Either the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" and \\( B \\) is \"the notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg A \\) means \"it is not true that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( B \\) (the notebook is in the drawer) can be inferred from these two statements.\n\n- From the first statement \\( A \\lor B \\), we know that at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) must be true.\n- From the second statement \\( \\neg A \\), we know that \\( A \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( A \\) is false, the only way for \\( A \\lor B \\) to still be true is if \\( B \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \\( B \\) (the notebook is in the drawer) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
