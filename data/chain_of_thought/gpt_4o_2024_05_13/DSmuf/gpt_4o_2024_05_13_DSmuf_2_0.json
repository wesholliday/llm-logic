The first statement is: \"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The book must be resting on the table\" and \\( B \\) is \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg A \\) means \"It is not the case that the book must be resting on the table.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( B \\) (The book is on the shelf) can be inferred from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and \\( \\neg A \\) (not \\( A \\)), we can conclude \\( B \\).\n\n4. Applying this rule to our statements:\n   - We have \\( A \\lor B \\) (Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf).\n   - We also have \\( \\neg A \\) (It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table).\n\nTherefore, by disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude \\( B \\) (The book is on the shelf).\n\nAnswer: yes",
