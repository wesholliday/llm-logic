The first statement is: \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( P \\lor D \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) represents \"The newspaper is on the porch.\"\n     - And \\( D \\) represents \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be sitting on the porch.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) means \"The newspaper is not on the porch.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( D \\) (the newspaper is in the driveway) can be inferred from \\( P \\lor D \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. Given \\( P \\lor D \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( D \\) is true), and \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)), we can use the rule of disjunction elimination:\n   - If \\( P \\lor D \\) is true and \\( \\neg P \\) is true, then \\( D \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis, we can infer that \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
