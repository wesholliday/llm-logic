The first statement is: \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     - Where \\( A \\) is \"The umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n     - And \\( B \\) is \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( B \\) (The umbrella is in the car) can be inferred from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) is true)\n   - And \\( \\neg A \\) (not \\( A \\))\n   - Then \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\lor B \\)\n- \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- \\( B \\)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis, we can infer that \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
