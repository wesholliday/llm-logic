    "user_prompt": "Suppose that coffee, tea, and soda are the most popular morning beverages. Market research indicates coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, followed by tea, with soda consumed much less in the mornings. These are the only major morning drinks, so if tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers. Moreover, coffee likely will retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers. Does it follow that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers?",

            "content": "To determine if it follows that it's likely that, if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers, let's break down the information provided:\n\n1. Coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers.\n2. Tea is likely to have fewer morning drinkers than coffee.\n3. Soda is consumed much less in the mornings compared to coffee and tea.\n4. If tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n5. Coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, and hence tea likely won't retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nFrom point 1, we know that coffee is the most likely to retain the most morning drinkers. This implies that the probability of coffee retaining the most morning drinkers is high.\n\nFrom point 5, since coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers, it follows that tea is unlikely to retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nNow, consider the conditional statement in point 4: \"If tea doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, then if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\" Given that tea is unlikely to retain the most morning drinkers (from point 5), we focus on the second part of the conditional statement: \"if coffee doesn\u2019t retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\"\n\nSince coffee is likely to retain the most morning drinkers (point 1), the scenario where coffee does not retain the most morning drinkers is unlikely. However, if this unlikely scenario occurs, the statement in point 4 tells us that soda will retain the most morning drinkers.\n\nTherefore, it follows that it is likely that if coffee doesn't retain the most morning drinkers, soda will retain the most morning drinkers, because the conditional statement in point 4 holds true under the given conditions.\n\nAnswer: yes",
