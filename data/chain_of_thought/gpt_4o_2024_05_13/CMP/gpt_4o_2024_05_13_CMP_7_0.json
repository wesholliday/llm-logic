    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "To determine if it follows that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will, let's break down the information given:\n\n1. **Leading Renewable Energy Sources**: Tidal power, solar power, and wind power.\n2. **Forecasts**: \n   - Tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity.\n   - Solar power is likely to generate the second most electricity.\n   - Wind power capacity is significantly behind.\n\n3. **Conditional Statement**: If solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will.\n\n4. **Likelihood**: Tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, so solar power likely won't.\n\nLet's analyze the conditional statement in detail:\n\n- **If solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity**: Given that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, this condition is likely true because solar power is forecasted to be second.\n\n- **Then if tidal power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, wind power will**: This part of the statement needs to be evaluated under the assumption that tidal power does not generate the most electricity.\n\nGiven the forecasts:\n- Tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity.\n- If tidal power does not generate the most electricity, then solar power is the next likely candidate to generate the most electricity because it is forecasted to be second.\n- Wind power is significantly behind in capacity, making it less likely to generate the most electricity compared to solar power.\n\nTherefore, if tidal power does not generate the most electricity, it is more likely that solar power will generate the most electricity rather than wind power, given the forecasts.\n\nThus, it does not follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will.\n\nAnswer: no",
