    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles. According to financial advisors, the stock market likely will see the highest returns this year, followed by real estate, with bonds having significantly lower expected returns. These markets offer the best investment options, so if real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will. Moreover, stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will?",

            "content": "To determine if it follows that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Primary Investment Vehicles**: The stock market, real estate market, and bond market are the primary investment vehicles.\n\n2. **Expected Returns**: According to financial advisors:\n   - Stocks likely will see the highest returns.\n   - Real estate will follow stocks in terms of returns.\n   - Bonds will have significantly lower expected returns.\n\n3. **Conditional Statements**:\n   - If real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns, then if stocks don\u2019t, bonds will.\n   - Stocks likely will have the highest returns and hence real estate likely won\u2019t.\n\n4. **Analysis**:\n   - The first conditional statement can be broken down:\n     - If real estate doesn\u2019t have the highest returns (which is likely since stocks are expected to have the highest returns), then if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will have the highest returns.\n   - The second statement reinforces that stocks are likely to have the highest returns, making it unlikely for real estate to have the highest returns.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given that stocks are likely to have the highest returns, real estate is unlikely to have the highest returns.\n   - If stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, the first conditional statement tells us that bonds will have the highest returns.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical structure of the statements, it follows that it\u2019s likely that, if stocks don\u2019t have the highest returns, bonds will.\n\nAnswer: yes",
