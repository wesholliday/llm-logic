    "user_prompt": "Suppose that pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods. According to restaurant data, pizza likely will be the top takeout item ordered, followed by burgers, with tacos ordered much less frequently. These foods lead takeout orders, so if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be. Moreover, pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be?",

            "content": "To determine if it follows that it's likely that, if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be, let's break down the information provided and the logical relationships:\n\n1. **Pizza, burgers, and tacos are the most frequently ordered takeout foods.**\n2. **Pizza is likely to be the top takeout item ordered.**\n3. **Burgers are likely to be the second most ordered item.**\n4. **Tacos are ordered much less frequently than pizza and burgers.**\n5. **If burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be.**\n6. **Pizza likely will lead takeout orders and hence burgers likely won\u2019t.**\n\nLet's analyze the statements step by step:\n\n- **Pizza is likely to be the top takeout item ordered.** This means that in most cases, pizza will be the top item.\n- **Burgers are likely to be the second most ordered item.** This implies that if pizza is not the top item, burgers are the next likely candidate.\n- **Tacos are ordered much less frequently than pizza and burgers.** This suggests that tacos are generally less popular compared to pizza and burgers.\n- **If burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be.** This conditional statement tells us that in the scenario where neither pizza nor burgers are the top item, tacos will be the top item.\n\nGiven that pizza is likely to be the top item, and if it isn't, burgers are the next likely candidate, the likelihood of tacos being the top item is low. However, the conditional statement (if burgers aren\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, then if pizza isn\u2019t, tacos will be) provides a specific scenario where tacos will be the top item if both pizza and burgers are not.\n\nSince pizza is likely to be the top item, and if it isn't, burgers are likely to be the top item, the scenario where both pizza and burgers are not the top items is unlikely. However, if that unlikely scenario occurs, tacos will indeed be the top item.\n\nTherefore, it follows that it is likely that if pizza isn\u2019t the top takeout item ordered, tacos will be, given the specific conditional statement provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
