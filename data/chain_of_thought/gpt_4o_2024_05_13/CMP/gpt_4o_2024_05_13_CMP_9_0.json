    "user_prompt": "Suppose that apples, bananas, and oranges are the most purchased fruits. According to grocery store data, it\u2019s likely apples will be the top-selling fruit this year, followed closely by bananas, with oranges trailing distantly behind. These are by far the top-selling fruits, so if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be. Moreover, it\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be. Does it follow that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be?",

            "content": "To determine if it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Top-Selling Fruits**: The most purchased fruits are apples, bananas, and oranges.\n2. **Likelihood of Top-Selling Fruit**: \n   - Apples are likely to be the top-selling fruit.\n   - Bananas are likely to be the second top-selling fruit.\n   - Oranges are trailing distantly behind.\n\n3. **Conditional Statements**:\n   - If bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be.\n   - It\u2019s likely apples will be top and hence bananas won\u2019t be.\n\n4. **Analyzing the Likelihood**:\n   - It is likely that apples will be the top-selling fruit.\n   - If apples are the top-selling fruit, then the condition \"if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit\" does not apply.\n   - However, we need to consider the scenario where apples are not the top-selling fruit.\n\n5. **Scenario Analysis**:\n   - If apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, then bananas are likely to be the top-selling fruit because they are the second most likely.\n   - The statement \"if bananas aren\u2019t the top seller, then if apples aren\u2019t, oranges will be\" suggests that if both apples and bananas are not the top sellers, then oranges will be the top seller.\n   - Given that apples are likely to be the top seller, if they are not, bananas are the next likely candidate.\n   - If bananas are not the top seller either, then oranges will be the top seller.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since it is likely that apples will be the top seller, the scenario where apples are not the top seller is less likely.\n   - If apples are not the top seller, bananas are the next likely candidate.\n   - If bananas are not the top seller, then oranges will be the top seller.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the logical analysis, it follows that it is likely that, if apples aren\u2019t the top-selling fruit, oranges will be.\n\nAnswer: yes",
