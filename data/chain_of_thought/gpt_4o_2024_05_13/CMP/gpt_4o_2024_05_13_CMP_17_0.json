    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

            "content": "To determine if it follows that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Prevalence Order Expectation**: The flu is expected to infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep throat infections lagging behind.\n\n2. **Conditional Statement**: If colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will.\n\n3. **Likelihood of Flu**: It is stated that flu likely will infect the most, and hence colds likely won\u2019t.\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n- **Flu Likely Infects the Most**: This means that in most scenarios, flu will be the most prevalent illness.\n- **Colds Likely Won\u2019t Infect the Most**: Since flu is likely to infect the most, it is unlikely that colds will infect the most.\n\nGiven the conditional statement:\n- If colds don\u2019t infect the most people (which is likely), then if flu doesn\u2019t (which is unlikely), strep will.\n\nSince flu is likely to infect the most, the scenario where flu doesn\u2019t infect the most is less likely. However, if we consider the less likely scenario where flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, the conditional statement tells us that strep will infect the most in that case.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will\" is consistent with the given information and the conditional logic provided.\n\nAnswer: yes",
