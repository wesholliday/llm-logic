    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "To determine if it follows that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will, we need to analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Projections**:\n   - Tennessee is projected to add the most jobs.\n   - Georgia is projected to follow closely behind Tennessee.\n   - Missouri's job growth is significantly lower than Tennessee and Georgia.\n\n2. **Conditional Statements**:\n   - If Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will.\n   - Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t.\n\n3. **Implications**:\n   - Since Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs, it implies that Georgia is less likely to add the most jobs.\n   - Given that Georgia likely won\u2019t add the most jobs, we need to consider the conditional statement: \"If Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will.\"\n\n4. **Analyzing the Conditional Statement**:\n   - The statement \"If Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will\" can be broken down:\n     - Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs (likely true since Tennessee is projected to add the most).\n     - If Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs (considering this scenario), then Missouri will add the most jobs.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Tennessee is likely to add the most jobs, the scenario where Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs is less likely.\n   - However, if we consider the less likely scenario where Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, the conditional statement tells us that Missouri will add the most jobs if Georgia also doesn\u2019t.\n\nGiven the projections and the conditional statements, it follows that if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will add the most jobs, considering Georgia is already less likely to add the most jobs.\n\nAnswer: yes",
