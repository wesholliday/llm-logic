    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "To determine if it follows that it's likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most, let's break down the given information and the logical implications step by step.\n\n1. **Given Information:**\n   - Rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase.\n   - Rents are projected to increase the most.\n   - Home prices are projected to increase, but not as much as rents.\n   - Mortgage rates are projected to increase the least.\n\n2. **Logical Implications:**\n   - If home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n   - Rents are likely to increase the most, so home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most.\n\n3. **Analysis:**\n   - Since rents are projected to increase the most, it implies that home prices and mortgage rates will not increase as much as rents.\n   - Given that home prices are not increasing the most, we need to consider the scenario where rents do not increase the most.\n   - If rents do not increase the most, then according to the given logical implication, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The statement \"if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most\" is directly supported by the given logical implication.\n   - Since it is given that rents are likely to increase the most, the condition where rents do not increase the most is less likely, but if it happens, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical implications, it follows that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: yes",
