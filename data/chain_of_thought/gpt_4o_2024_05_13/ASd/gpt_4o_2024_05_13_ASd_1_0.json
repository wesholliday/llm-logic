This suggests that the condition \\( R \\) (soaked in water) would likely negate the outcome \\( Q \\) (it will light).\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since the original statement does not account for the condition of the match being soaked in water, and considering the real-world effect of water on a match, we cannot logically infer that a soaked match will light when struck based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
