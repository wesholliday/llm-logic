The original statement is a conditional: \"If we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"we go to the concert\" and \\( Q \\) is \"we'll have a good time.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( R \\) is \"a bomb goes off.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we need to consider whether the additional condition \\( R \\) (a bomb going off) affects the outcome \\( Q \\) (we'll have a good time).\n\n- The original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide any information about what happens if additional conditions are introduced.\n- The presence of a bomb going off (condition \\( R \\)) could potentially change the outcome, making it unreasonable to assume that \\( Q \\) (we'll have a good time) will still hold true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \\( (P \\land R) \\rightarrow Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) because the additional condition \\( R \\) (a bomb going off) could affect the outcome.\n\nAnswer: no",
