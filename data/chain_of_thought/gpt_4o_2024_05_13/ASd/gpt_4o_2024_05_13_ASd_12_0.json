The original statement is a conditional: \"If I finish my homework, I can play video games.\"\n   - This means that finishing homework is a sufficient condition for being able to play video games.\n\n2. The new statement adds an additional condition: \"If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games.\"\n   - This means that both finishing homework and the computer catching on fire must be true for the conclusion (playing video games) to hold.\n\n3. The original statement does not provide any information about what happens if the computer catches on fire. It only states that finishing homework is enough to play video games, assuming normal circumstances.\n\n4. The new statement introduces a scenario (computer catching on fire) that could potentially prevent playing video games, which is not addressed in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the new statement from the original one because the additional condition (computer catching on fire) could affect the ability to play video games, and this scenario is not covered by the original conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
