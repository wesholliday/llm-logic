The original statement is a conditional statement: \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( W \\rightarrow A \\), where \\( W \\) stands for \"the essay is well-written\" and \\( A \\) stands for \"the student will get an A.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( (W \\land L) \\rightarrow A \\), where \\( L \\) stands for \"the essay is turned in late.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (W \\land L) \\rightarrow A \\) from \\( W \\rightarrow A \\), we need to consider whether the additional condition \\( L \\) (the essay being turned in late) affects the outcome \\( A \\) (the student getting an A).\n\n- The original statement \\( W \\rightarrow A \\) does not provide any information about the timing of the submission. It only states that if the essay is well-written, the student will get an A.\n- The new statement introduces an additional condition (the essay being turned in late), which is not addressed in the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement does not specify anything about the timing of the submission, we cannot infer that the student will get an A if the essay is both well-written and turned in late. The lateness of the submission could potentially affect the grade, but this is not covered by the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: no",
