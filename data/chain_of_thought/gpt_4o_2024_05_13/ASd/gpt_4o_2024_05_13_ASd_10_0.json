The original statement is: \"If the order is placed, then the item will ship.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the order is placed\" and \\( S \\) is \"the item will ship.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (P \\land Q) \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( Q \\) is \"the item is out of stock.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (P \\land Q) \\rightarrow S \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow S \\), we need to consider the logical relationship between these statements.\n\n- \\( P \\rightarrow S \\) means that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( S \\) must also be true.\n- \\( (P \\land Q) \\rightarrow S \\) means that whenever both \\( P \\) and \\( Q \\) are true, \\( S \\) must be true.\n\nHowever, the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow S \\) does not provide any information about the status of \\( Q \\) (whether the item is out of stock or not). It only states that if the order is placed, the item will ship, regardless of whether the item is in stock or out of stock.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( (P \\land Q) \\rightarrow S \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow S \\) because the original statement does not address the condition of the item being out of stock.\n\nAnswer: no",
