The original statement is: \"If the bill is paid, then the services will continue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the bill is paid\" and \\( S \\) is \"the services will continue.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( (P \\land B) \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) is \"the check bounces.\"\n\nTo infer \\( (P \\land B) \\rightarrow S \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow S \\), we need to consider the following:\n\n- \\( P \\rightarrow S \\) means that whenever \\( P \\) is true, \\( S \\) must also be true.\n- \\( (P \\land B) \\rightarrow S \\) means that whenever both \\( P \\) and \\( B \\) are true, \\( S \\) must be true.\n\nHowever, the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow S \\) does not provide any information about what happens if the check bounces (i.e., \\( B \\)). It only states that if the bill is paid (\\( P \\)), then the services will continue (\\( S \\)). It does not account for the scenario where the bill is paid but the check bounces.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \\( (P \\land B) \\rightarrow S \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow S \\) because the original statement does not address the condition where the check bounces.\n\nAnswer: no",
