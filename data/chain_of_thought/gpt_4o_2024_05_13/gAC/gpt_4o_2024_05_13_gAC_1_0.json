            "content": "To determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written as:\n   - If M, then S (M \u2192 S)\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written as:\n   - S is true\n\nWe need to determine if 'Mary was at the wedding' (M) is true based on these statements.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The conditional statement (M \u2192 S) tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was definitely at the wedding.\n- The fact that Sue was at the wedding (S is true) does not provide any information about whether Mary was at the wedding. The conditional statement does not work in reverse; it does not say that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding does not allow us to conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
