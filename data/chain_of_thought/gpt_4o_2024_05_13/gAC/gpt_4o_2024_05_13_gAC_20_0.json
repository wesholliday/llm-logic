'The banana was yellow' is true.\n\nWe need to analyze the logical structure of these statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n2. The second statement asserts that Q is true: \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nIn logic, the truth of Q (the banana was yellow) does not necessarily imply the truth of P (the apple was red). The conditional statement only tells us what happens if P is true, but it does not provide information about the situation when Q is true independently of P.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that 'The apple was red' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
