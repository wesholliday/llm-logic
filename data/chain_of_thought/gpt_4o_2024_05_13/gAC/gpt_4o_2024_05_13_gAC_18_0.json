The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (i.e., \"The doll was plastic\") is true given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\). The conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not provide information about \\( P \\)'s truth value. \\( Q \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( P \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that 'The doll was plastic' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
