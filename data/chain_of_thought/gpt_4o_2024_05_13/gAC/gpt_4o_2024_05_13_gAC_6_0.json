The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Sue chose pizza) is true given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\). The conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us what happens if \\( P \\) is true, but it does not provide information about \\( P \\) if \\( Q \\) is true. \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( P \\) (Sue chose pizza) is true just because \\( Q \\) (Bob chose pasta) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
