The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( L \\) (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true given the above information.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) does not provide information about the truth value of \\( L \\) if \\( M \\) is true. The truth of \\( M \\) alone does not imply the truth of \\( L \\). The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( L \\) were true, then \\( M \\) would necessarily be true. However, \\( M \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( L \\) is true; \\( M \\) could be true regardless of \\( L \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that 'Lisa bought the red shirt' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
