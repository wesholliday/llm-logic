'The pants were denim' (which we know is true).\n\nWe need to analyze the logical structure of these statements.\n\nThe first statement is a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nThe second statement tells us that Q is true: \"The pants were denim.\"\n\nIn logic, knowing that Q is true does not necessarily tell us anything about P. The truth of Q (the pants being denim) could be due to other reasons besides P (the shirt being cotton). The conditional statement only tells us what happens if P is true, not what happens if Q is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude that P (the shirt was cotton) is true just because Q (the pants were denim) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
