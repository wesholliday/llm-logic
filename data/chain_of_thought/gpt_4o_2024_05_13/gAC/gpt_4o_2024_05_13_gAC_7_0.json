The first statement is a conditional: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written as \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Chris finished the race is true.\" This means \\( C \\) is true.\n\nWe need to determine if \\( A \\) (Alex finished the race) is true based on the given information.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) tells us that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be true.\n- However, the truth of \\( C \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( A \\). \\( C \\) being true could be the result of other conditions or reasons not related to \\( A \\).\n\nTherefore, knowing that \\( C \\) is true does not provide enough information to conclude that \\( A \\) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
