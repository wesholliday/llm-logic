The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (i.e., \"The book was written by James\") is true based on the given information.\n\nIn logic, the truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\). The conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( P \\). There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true that do not involve \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( P \\) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
