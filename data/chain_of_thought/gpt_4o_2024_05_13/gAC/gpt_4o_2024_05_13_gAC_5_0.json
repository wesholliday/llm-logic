The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Amy played tennis.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball) is true given these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) does not provide information about the truth value of \\( J \\) if \\( A \\) is true. The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must be true. However, \\( A \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( J \\) is true. \\( A \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( J \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( J \\) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
