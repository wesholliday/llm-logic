The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake.\"\n2. The second statement asserts that Q is true: \"The mummy was awake.\"\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" does not provide information about the truth value of P (the vampire being awake) if Q (the mummy being awake) is true. It only tells us that if P were true, then Q would necessarily be true. However, knowing that Q is true does not allow us to conclude anything about P. P could be true or false independently of Q being true.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that \"The vampire was awake.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
