The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( J \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( T \\) (Tom watched football) is true given these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) does not provide information about the truth value of \\( T \\) if \\( J \\) is true. The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( T \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must be true. However, \\( J \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( T \\) is true. \\( J \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( T \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( T \\) (Tom watched football) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
