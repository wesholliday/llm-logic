            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding, we need to analyze the logical structure of the given statement.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical terms as:\n\\[ M \\rightarrow S \\]\nwhere \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nThe question asks if we can infer the reverse: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\" This can be written as:\n\\[ S \\rightarrow M \\]\n\nIn logic, the statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) does not imply \\( S \\rightarrow M \\). The original statement only tells us that Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence, but it does not provide any information about Sue's presence guaranteeing Mary's presence.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- If Mary was at the wedding (M is true), then Sue was at the wedding (S is true).\n- However, if Sue was at the wedding (S is true), we do not have enough information to conclude that Mary was at the wedding (M could be true or false).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding based on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
