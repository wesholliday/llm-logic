If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n     where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\nThe proposed inference is:\n2. If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow J \\)\n\nTo check if the proposed inference is valid, we need to determine if \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) logically implies \\( A \\rightarrow J \\).\n\nIn logic, \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) does not necessarily imply \\( A \\rightarrow J \\). The original statement only tells us that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. It does not provide any information about what happens if Amy played tennis. Therefore, we cannot conclude that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball based solely on the given statement.\n\nThus, the proposed inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
