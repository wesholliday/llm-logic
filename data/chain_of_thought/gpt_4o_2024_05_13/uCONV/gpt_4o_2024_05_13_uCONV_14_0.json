The reverse implication is not guaranteed by the original statement. The original statement only tells us that the presence of the bear in the cave guarantees the presence of the wolf in the den, but it does not tell us anything about the presence of the wolf in the den guaranteeing the presence of the bear in the cave.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the cave.\n\nAnswer: no",
