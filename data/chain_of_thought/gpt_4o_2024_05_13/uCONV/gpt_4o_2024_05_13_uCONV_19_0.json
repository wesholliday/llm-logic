The original statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the statement \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football\" can be inferred.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow T \\)\n\nIn logic, the statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) does not imply \\( J \\rightarrow T \\). The implication \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) only tells us that if \\( T \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must be true. It does not provide any information about what happens if \\( J \\) is true.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Suppose \\( T \\) is false (Tom did not watch football). The original statement \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) would still be true regardless of whether \\( J \\) is true or false.\n- Therefore, knowing \\( J \\) is true (Jen watched basketball) does not necessarily mean \\( T \\) is true (Tom watched football).\n\nThus, we cannot infer \\( J \\rightarrow T \\) from \\( T \\rightarrow J \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
