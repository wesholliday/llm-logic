The original statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be written in logical terms as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the converse of this statement is true. The converse of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\):\n   - \"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\"\n\n3. In logic, the truth of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). The converse of a true statement is not guaranteed to be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
