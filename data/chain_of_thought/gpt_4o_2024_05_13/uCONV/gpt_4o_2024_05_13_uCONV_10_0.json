The contrapositive of the given statement is:\n\u00acC (cat not outside, i.e., cat inside) \u2192 \u00acD (dog not inside, i.e., dog outside)\n\nHowever, the statement we are trying to infer is not the contrapositive but the converse. The converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. The converse of the given statement is:\nC (cat outside) \u2192 D (dog inside)\n\nSince the truth of the converse is not guaranteed by the truth of the original statement, we cannot infer that if the cat was outside, then the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: no",
