The original statement only tells us what happens if the cake is chocolate, not what happens if the muffins are blueberry. The reverse implication (M \u2192 C) is not guaranteed by the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
