            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake, we need to analyze the given statement and its logical implications.\n\nThe given statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nThis can be written in logical terms as:\nV \u2192 M\nwhere V represents \"the vampire was awake\" and M represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always true if the original statement is true. The contrapositive of V \u2192 M is:\n\u00acM \u2192 \u00acV\nwhich means \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nHowever, the converse of the original statement, which is \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" (M \u2192 V), is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. The truth of the converse must be established independently.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information alone, we cannot infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\n\nAnswer: no",
