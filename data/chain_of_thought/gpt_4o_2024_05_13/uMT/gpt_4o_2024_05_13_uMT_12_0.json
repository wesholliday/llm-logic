            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that Joe did not go to the park, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written as:\n   - If P, then Q (where P = Joe went to the park, and Q = Lucy went to the zoo).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\" This can be written as:\n   - Not Q (where Q = Lucy went to the zoo).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Not P\" (Joe did not go to the park) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\" The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven the original statement \"If P, then Q,\" the contrapositive is:\n   - If not Q, then not P.\n\nWe know from the second statement that \"Not Q\" is true (Lucy did not go to the zoo). According to the contrapositive, if \"Not Q\" is true, then \"Not P\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
