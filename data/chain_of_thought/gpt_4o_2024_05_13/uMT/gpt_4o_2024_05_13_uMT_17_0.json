The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B \\rightarrow K \\) (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad)\n- \\( \\neg K \\) (Kate did not eat salad)\n\nUsing the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) (If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg K \\) is true (Kate did not eat salad), we can apply the contrapositive:\n- From \\( \\neg K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) and \\( \\neg K \\), we can infer \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
