The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of our original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is:\n- \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n  - If the truck was not metal (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then the doll was not plastic (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nSince we are given \\( \\neg Q \\) (the truck was not metal), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg P \\) (the doll was not plastic).\n\nAnswer: yes",
