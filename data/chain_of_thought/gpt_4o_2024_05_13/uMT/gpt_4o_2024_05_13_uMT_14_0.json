It states that if \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) and \\( \\neg W \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg B \\) must be true.\n   - Given \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) (if the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den) and \\( \\neg W \\) (the wolf was not in the den), we can apply Modus Tollens to conclude \\( \\neg B \\) (the bear was not in the cave).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the application of Modus Tollens, we can infer that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes",
