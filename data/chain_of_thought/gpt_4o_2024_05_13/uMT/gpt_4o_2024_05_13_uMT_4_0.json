The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This can be written in logical terms as:\n   - \\( A \\rightarrow R \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"the alien visited Mars\" and \\( R \\) represents \"the robot visited Jupiter.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( \\neg R \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg R \\) represents \"the robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg A \\) (the alien did not visit Mars) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) and we know that \\( R \\) is false (\\( \\neg R \\)), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg A \\). The contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) is \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg R \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg R \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n\nGiven \\( \\neg R \\) is true, it follows that \\( \\neg A \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
