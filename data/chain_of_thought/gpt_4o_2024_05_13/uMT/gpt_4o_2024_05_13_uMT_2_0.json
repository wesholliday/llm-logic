It states that if \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) and \\( \\neg U \\) are both true, then \\( \\neg G \\) must also be true.\n   - Given \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) (if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest)\n   - And \\( \\neg U \\) (the unicorn was not in the forest)\n   - We can apply Modus Tollens to conclude \\( \\neg G \\) (the griffin was not in the forest).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the application of Modus Tollens, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
