The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) represents \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg A \\) (the apple was not red) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow)\n- \\( \\neg B \\) (The banana was not yellow)\n\nUsing the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) (If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red)\n\nSince \\( \\neg B \\) is true (the banana was not yellow), we can apply the contrapositive:\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg A \\) must be true (the apple was not red).\n\nAnswer: yes",
