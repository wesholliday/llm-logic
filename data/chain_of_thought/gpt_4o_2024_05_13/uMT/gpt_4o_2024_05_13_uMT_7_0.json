The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is:\n\\[ \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\]\n\nGiven \\( \\neg C \\) (Chris did not finish the race), we can apply the contrapositive:\n\\[ \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\]\n\nSince \\( \\neg C \\) is true, it follows that \\( \\neg A \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
