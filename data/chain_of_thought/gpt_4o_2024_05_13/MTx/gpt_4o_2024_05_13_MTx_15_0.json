The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The dreb was not spened.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - Not Q (\u00acQ)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (\u00acP) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that Q is false (\u00acQ), we can use the contrapositive to infer that P must also be false (\u00acP). The contrapositive of a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) is (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven:\n- P \u2192 Q (If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened)\n- \u00acQ (The dreb was not spened)\n\nUsing the contrapositive:\n- \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP (If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed)\n\nSince we have \u00acQ (The dreb was not spened), we can infer \u00acP (The dreb was not vroombed).\n\nAnswer: yes",
