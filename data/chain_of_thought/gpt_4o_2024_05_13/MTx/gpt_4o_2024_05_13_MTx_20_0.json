The first statement is: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow S \\)\n     - Where \\( B \\) represents \"The fleeg was bluttered\"\n     - And \\( S \\) represents \"The fleeg surned\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fleeg did not surn.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg B \\) (The fleeg was not bluttered) can be inferred from \\( B \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nIn logic, if we have \\( B \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nThe contrapositive of \\( B \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg S \\), we can apply the contrapositive to conclude \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
