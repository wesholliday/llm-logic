The first statement is: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow T \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the whiffle was shanked\"\n     - And \\( T \\) represents \"the whiffle tinked\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The whiffle did not tink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg T \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg S \\) (the whiffle was not shanked) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) and \\( \\neg T \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nThe contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) is \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg T \\) (the whiffle did not tink), and the contrapositive tells us that \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), we can indeed infer \\( \\neg S \\) (the whiffle was not shanked).\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
