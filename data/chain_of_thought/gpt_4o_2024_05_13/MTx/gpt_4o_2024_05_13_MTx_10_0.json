The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Where P is \"The wug was sproinged\" and Q is \"The wug was garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug was not garpled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - Not Q (\u00acQ)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acP (The wug was not sproinged) from P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ.\n\nIn logic, this is a classic case of modus tollens, which states that if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and the negation of the consequent (\u00acQ), we can infer the negation of the antecedent (\u00acP).\n\nApplying modus tollens:\n- P \u2192 Q (If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled)\n- \u00acQ (The wug was not garpled)\n- Therefore, \u00acP (The wug was not sproinged)\n\nThus, we can infer 'The wug was not sproinged' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
