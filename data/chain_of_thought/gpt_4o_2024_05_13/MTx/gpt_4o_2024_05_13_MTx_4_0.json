The first statement is: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow C \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the fribble was snurgled\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the fribble crinked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fribble did not crink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the fribble did not crink.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg S \\) (the fribble was not snurgled) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have \\( S \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg S \\). The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow C \\) is \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S \\rightarrow C \\)\n- \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nBy the contrapositive, \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg C \\), we can infer \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
