The first statement is: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( F \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( F \\) represents \"the zinger was fraggled\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The zinger was not smoogled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg F \\) (the zinger was not fraggled) from \\( F \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of an implication \\( F \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( F \\rightarrow S \\) (If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled)\n- \\( \\neg S \\) (The zinger was not smoogled)\n\nUsing the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\) (If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled)\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg S \\), we can apply the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg F \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
