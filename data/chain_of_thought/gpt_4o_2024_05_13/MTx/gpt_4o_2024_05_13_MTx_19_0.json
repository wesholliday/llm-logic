The first statement is: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow P \\)\n     - Where \\( V \\) represents \"the smonk was vreebled\"\n     - And \\( P \\) represents \"the smonk plagged\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The smonk did not plagged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg V \\) (the smonk was not vreebled) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have \\( V \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg V \\).\n\nThe contrapositive of \\( V \\rightarrow P \\) is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\).\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg P \\) (the smonk did not plagged), and the contrapositive tells us that \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\), we can indeed infer \\( \\neg V \\) (the smonk was not vreebled).\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
