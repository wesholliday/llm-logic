The first statement is: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow P \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents \"the grommet was sploffed\" and \\( P \\) represents \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg S \\) (the grommet was not sploffed) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of an implication \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) (If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink)\n- \\( \\neg P \\) (The grommet did not plop the frink)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) (If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed)\n\nSince \\( \\neg P \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg S \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
