The first statement is: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow M \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the flob was skizzled\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the flob movated.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flob did not movated.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"the flob did not movated.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg S \\) (the flob was not skizzled) from \\( S \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of an implication \\( S \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S \\rightarrow M \\) (If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated)\n- \\( \\neg M \\) (The flob did not movated)\n\nFrom the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) (If the flob did not movated, then the flob was not skizzled)\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg M \\) (the flob did not movated), we can apply the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg S \\) (the flob was not skizzled).\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The flob was not skizzled' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
