The first statement is: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow V \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) represents \"The twonk was plinked.\"\n     - And \\( V \\) represents \"The twonk was varnished.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The twonk was not varnished.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg V \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (The twonk was not plinked) from these statements.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens:\n   - If \\( P \\rightarrow V \\) (If P then V) and \\( \\neg V \\) (Not V) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) (Not P) must be true.\n\n4. Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - Given \\( P \\rightarrow V \\) and \\( \\neg V \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\" and \"The twonk was not varnished,\" we can indeed infer \"The twonk was not plinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
