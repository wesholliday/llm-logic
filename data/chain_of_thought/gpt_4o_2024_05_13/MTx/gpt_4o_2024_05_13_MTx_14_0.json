The first statement is: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"the clug was fleeked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the clug snugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The clug did not snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg P \\) (the clug was not fleeked) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logic, if we have \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and since we have \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
