The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow T \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"The glip was slogged.\"\n     - And \\( T \\) represents \"The glip was tragged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The glip was not tragged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg T \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The glip was not slogged\" (\\( \\neg S \\)) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) and we know that \\( T \\) is false (\\( \\neg T \\)), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg S \\). The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) is \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S \\rightarrow T \\)\n- \\( \\neg T \\)\n\nBy the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\nSince \\( \\neg T \\) is true, we can infer \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
