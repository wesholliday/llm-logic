The first statement is: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow S \\)\n     - Where \\( C \\) represents \"the sneg was crampled\"\n     - And \\( S \\) represents \"the sneg sproted the frink\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The sneg did not sproted the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the sneg did not sproted the frink\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg C \\) (the sneg was not crampled) from \\( C \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nIn logic, if we have \\( C \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg C \\). The contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg S \\), and the contrapositive tells us that \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), we can indeed infer \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
