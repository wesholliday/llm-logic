The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow N \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"the shank was plooked\" and \\( N \\) represents \"the shank was nugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The shank was not nugged.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( \\neg N \\)\n   where \\( \\neg N \\) represents \"the shank was not nugged.\"\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The shank was not plooked\" (which can be written as \\( \\neg P \\)) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) is \\( \\neg N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, the contrapositive is also true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) (If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged)\n- \\( \\neg N \\) (The shank was not nugged)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of the first statement, we have:\n- \\( \\neg N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg N \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg P \\) (The shank was not plooked)\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
