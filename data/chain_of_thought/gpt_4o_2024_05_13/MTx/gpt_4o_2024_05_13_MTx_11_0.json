The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the flug was blummed\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"the flug was zimmed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flug was not zimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Z \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg B \\) (the flug was not blummed) from \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\) and \\( \\neg Z \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\) is \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\) is:\n\\[ \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\]\n\nGiven \\( \\neg Z \\) (the flug was not zimmed), we can apply the contrapositive:\n\\[ \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\]\n\nSince \\( \\neg Z \\) is true, it follows that \\( \\neg B \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The flug was not blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
