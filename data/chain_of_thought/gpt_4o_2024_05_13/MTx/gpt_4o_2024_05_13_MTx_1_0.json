The first statement is: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\)\n     (If B, then Z)\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flugel was not zargled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Z \\)\n     (Not Z)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg B \\) (The flugel was not blimmed) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of an implication \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\) is \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\) (If B, then Z)\n- \\( \\neg Z \\) (Not Z)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of the first statement, we have:\n- \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) (If not Z, then not B)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg Z \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg Z \\) implies \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nTherefore, from \\( \\neg Z \\) and \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
