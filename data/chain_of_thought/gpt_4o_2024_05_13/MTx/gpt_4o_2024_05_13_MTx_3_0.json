The first statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( M \\) represents \"the splat was morphed\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) represents \"the splat quanked\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The splat did not quank.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg M \\) (the splat was not morphed) from \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of an implication \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) (The splat did not quank)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) (If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
