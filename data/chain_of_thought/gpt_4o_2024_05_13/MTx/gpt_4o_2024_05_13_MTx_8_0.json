The contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) is \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( C \\rightarrow D \\)\n- \\( \\neg D \\)\n\nBy the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n\nSince we have \\( \\neg D \\) (The sprocket was not daggled), we can apply the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg C \\) (The sprocket was not cranked).\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
