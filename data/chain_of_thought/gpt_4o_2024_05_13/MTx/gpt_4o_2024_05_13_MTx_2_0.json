            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The wug was not flooped' from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The wug was flooped\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg P \\) (The wug was not flooped) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\) (The wug did not bim the zoint)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped)\n\nSince \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The wug was not flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
