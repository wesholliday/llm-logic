The original statement is 'The frazzle might be wump'. This means there is a possibility that the frazzle is wump.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The frazzle might be wump or quimble'. This means there is a possibility that the frazzle is either wump or quimble.\n\nThe key point here is that the original statement only provides information about the possibility of the frazzle being wump. It does not provide any information about the possibility of the frazzle being quimble. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the possibility of the frazzle being quimble from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
