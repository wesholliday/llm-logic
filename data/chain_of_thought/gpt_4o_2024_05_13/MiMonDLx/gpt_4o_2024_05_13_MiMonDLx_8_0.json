The original statement is 'The gribble might be quork'. This means there is a possibility that the gribble is quork.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The gribble might be quork or grazzle'. This means there is a possibility that the gribble is either quork or grazzle.\n\nIf the gribble might be quork, then it is true that the gribble might be quork or grazzle because the 'or' condition is satisfied if at least one of the possibilities is true. Since 'The gribble might be quork' is true, it implies that 'The gribble might be quork or grazzle' is also true because the 'or' condition does not require both conditions to be true, just one.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The gribble might be quork or grazzle' from 'The gribble might be quork'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
