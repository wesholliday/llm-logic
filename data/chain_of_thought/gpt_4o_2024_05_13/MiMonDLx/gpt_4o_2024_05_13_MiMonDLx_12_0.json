The original statement is 'The snorkel might be flim.' This means there is a possibility that the snorkel is flim.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The snorkel might be flim or gronk.' This means there is a possibility that the snorkel is either flim or gronk.\n\nIn logic, if something might be one thing, it does not exclude the possibility that it might also be another thing. Therefore, if the snorkel might be flim, it is logically consistent to say that the snorkel might be flim or gronk, because the addition of 'or gronk' does not contradict the original possibility of it being flim.\n\nThus, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
