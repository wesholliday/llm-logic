It does not definitively state that they are not in her bag, only that it is possible they are not.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\" This means it is not necessarily true that the sunglasses have to be in her bag. There is no requirement or certainty that they are in her bag.\n\nGiven that the first statement allows for the possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag, it aligns with the idea that it is not a necessity for the sunglasses to be in her bag. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
