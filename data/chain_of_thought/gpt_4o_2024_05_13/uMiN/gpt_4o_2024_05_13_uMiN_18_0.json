It does not definitively state that the notebook is not in the drawer, only that it is possible.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.\" This means it is not necessary for the notebook to be in the drawer. There is no requirement or certainty that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nIf the notebook might not be in the drawer, then it is not certain that the notebook must be in the drawer. Therefore, the possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer supports the idea that it is not required for the notebook to be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: yes",
