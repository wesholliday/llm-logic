It does not definitively state that the shoes are not in the closet, only that it is possible they are not.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\" This means it is not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet. In other words, there is no requirement that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nIf the shoes might not be in the closet, then it is possible for the shoes to be elsewhere. This aligns with the idea that it is not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet. Therefore, the possibility that the shoes are not in the closet supports the inference that it is not required for the shoes to be in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
