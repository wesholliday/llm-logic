It does not definitively state that the pen is not in your bag, only that it is possible.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\" This means it is not necessary for the pen to be in your bag. There is no requirement or certainty that the pen is in your bag.\n\nGiven that the first statement allows for the possibility that the pen is not in your bag, it aligns with the idea that it is not necessary for the pen to be in your bag. Therefore, we can infer that if the pen might not be in your bag, it is not the case that the pen must be in your bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
