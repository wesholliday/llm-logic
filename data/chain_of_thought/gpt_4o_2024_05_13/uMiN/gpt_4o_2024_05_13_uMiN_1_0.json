            "content": "To determine if we can infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" suggests that there is a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding. This means that her attendance is uncertain; she could have been there, or she might not have been there.\n\n2. \"Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies certainty that Mary was at the wedding. There is no doubt in this statement; it asserts that her attendance is definite.\n\nGiven that the first statement allows for the possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, it contradicts the certainty implied by the second statement. Therefore, if we accept the first statement as true, we cannot accept the second statement as true.\n\nThus, we can infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
