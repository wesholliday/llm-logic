This means that it is not certain that she chose pizza.\n2. \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" means that it is not necessary or certain that Sue chose pizza.\n\nIf there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza, then it cannot be certain that she must have chosen pizza. Therefore, the statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" supports the inference that \"it's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
