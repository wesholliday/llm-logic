It does not definitively state that the jacket is not draped over the chair, only that it is possible.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\"\n   - This means it is not necessary for the jacket to be draped over the chair. There is no requirement for the jacket to be in that specific position.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement allows for the possibility that the jacket is not draped over the chair.\n- The second statement asserts that there is no necessity for the jacket to be draped over the chair.\n\nSince the first statement implies that the jacket does not have to be draped over the chair (it might not be), it aligns with the second statement, which explicitly states that the jacket does not have to be draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the jacket might not be draped over the chair, it is not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: yes",
