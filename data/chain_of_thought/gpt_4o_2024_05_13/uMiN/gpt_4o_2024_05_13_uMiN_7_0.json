It does not definitively state that Alex did not finish, only that it is possible.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\"\n   - This implies that it is not certain that Alex finished the race. In other words, there is no necessity that Alex finished the race.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement suggests a possibility (Alex might not have finished).\n- The second statement suggests a lack of necessity (Alex must not have finished).\n\nIf there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race, then it cannot be certain that Alex must have finished the race. Therefore, the first statement supports the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
