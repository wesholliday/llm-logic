It does not definitively state that the toy is not in the toy box, only that it is possible.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\"\n   - This means it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box. There is no requirement that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nGiven that the first statement allows for the possibility that the toy is not in the toy box, it aligns with the idea that it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer that if the toy might not be in the toy box, it is not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
