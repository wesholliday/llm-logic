            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, let's break down the statements:\n\n1. \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\" This implies that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. It does not definitively state that she did not buy it, only that it is possible she did not.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\" This means that it is not necessarily true that Lisa bought the red shirt. In other words, it is possible that she did not buy it.\n\nGiven that the first statement allows for the possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, it aligns with the second statement, which also allows for the possibility that she did not buy it.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, then it is not the case that she must have bought it.\n\nAnswer: yes",
