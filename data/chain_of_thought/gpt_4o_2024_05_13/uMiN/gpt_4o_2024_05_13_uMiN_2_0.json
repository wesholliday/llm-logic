It does not definitively state that the griffin was not in the forest, only that it is possible.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\"\n   - This means it is not necessarily true that the griffin had to be in the forest. There is no requirement or certainty that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nGiven that the first statement allows for the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest, it aligns with the idea that it is not a necessity for the griffin to have been in the forest. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
