It does not definitively state that the milk is not on the counter, only that it is possible.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\" This means that it is not necessary for the milk to be on the counter. There is no requirement for the milk to be on the counter.\n\nIf the milk might not be on the counter, then it is not necessarily required for the milk to be on the counter. Therefore, we can infer that it is not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
