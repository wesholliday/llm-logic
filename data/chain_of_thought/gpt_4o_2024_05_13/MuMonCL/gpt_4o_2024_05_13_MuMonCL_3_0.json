            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The car must have been in the garage' from the statement 'The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs', we need to analyze the logical structure of the original statement. The original statement is a conjunction of two conditions: \n\n1. The car must have been in the garage.\n2. The car needed repairs.\n\nIn a conjunction, both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true. Therefore, if the entire statement 'The car must have been in the garage and needed repairs' is true, then each individual condition must also be true. This means that 'The car must have been in the garage' is a necessary part of the original statement.\n\nThus, we can infer 'The car must have been in the garage' from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
