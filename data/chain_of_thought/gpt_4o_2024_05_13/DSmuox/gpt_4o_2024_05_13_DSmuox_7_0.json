We know \u00acT (the whiffle must not be tinked).\n2. We also know S \u2228 T (either the whiffle is shanked or it must be tinked).\n\nGiven \u00acT, we can substitute \u00acT into the disjunction S \u2228 T:\n\n- Since T is false (\u00acT is true), the disjunction S \u2228 T simplifies to S \u2228 false, which is just S.\n\nTherefore, if T is false, the only way for the disjunction S \u2228 T to be true is if S is true.\n\nThus, we can infer that S (the whiffle is shanked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
