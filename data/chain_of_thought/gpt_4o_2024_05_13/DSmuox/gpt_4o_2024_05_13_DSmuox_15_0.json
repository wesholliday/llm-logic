V \u2228 S (where V stands for 'the dreb is vroombed')\n\nGiven \u00acS (the dreb must not be spened), we can substitute \u00acS into the second statement:\n- V \u2228 S becomes V \u2228 \u00acS\n\nSince we know \u00acS is true, the second statement simplifies to:\n- V \u2228 false, which simplifies to V\n\nTherefore, V (the dreb is vroombed) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
