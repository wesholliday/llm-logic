From the first statement, we have \u00acS (the clug must not be snugged).\n\n2. From the second statement, we have F \u2228 S (either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged).\n\n3. Given \u00acS (the clug must not be snugged), we can substitute \u00acS into the second statement.\n\n4. The second statement becomes F \u2228 S. Since S is false (\u00acS is true), the statement simplifies to F \u2228 false, which is just F.\n\n5. Therefore, F must be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
