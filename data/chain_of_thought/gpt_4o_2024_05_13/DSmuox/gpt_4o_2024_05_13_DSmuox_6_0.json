The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acP (where P represents \"the grommet must be plopped\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\"\n   - This can be written as: S \u2228 P (where S represents \"the grommet is sploffed\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer S (the grommet is sploffed) from \u00acP and S \u2228 P.\n\n3. From \u00acP, we know that P is false.\n   - Therefore, P = false.\n\n4. Given S \u2228 P, and knowing that P is false, the disjunction S \u2228 P simplifies to S \u2228 false.\n   - This simplifies further to just S.\n\nSince S \u2228 P simplifies to S when P is false, and we know P is false from \u00acP, we can conclude that S must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
