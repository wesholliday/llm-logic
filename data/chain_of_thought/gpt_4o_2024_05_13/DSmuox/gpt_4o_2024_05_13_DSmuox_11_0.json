The first statement \u00ac(F \u2192 Z) can be rewritten using the implication equivalence:\n   - F \u2192 Z is equivalent to \u00acF \u2228 Z.\n   - Therefore, \u00ac(F \u2192 Z) is equivalent to \u00ac(\u00acF \u2228 Z).\n   - Using De Morgan's laws, \u00ac(\u00acF \u2228 Z) is equivalent to F \u2227 \u00acZ.\n\n   So, the first statement simplifies to: F \u2227 \u00acZ.\n\n2. The second statement is B \u2228 Z.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer B (the flug is blummed) from these simplified statements:\n\n- From F \u2227 \u00acZ, we know that F is true and Z is false.\n- From B \u2228 Z, since Z is false, B must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, given that Z is false and B \u2228 Z must be true, B must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
