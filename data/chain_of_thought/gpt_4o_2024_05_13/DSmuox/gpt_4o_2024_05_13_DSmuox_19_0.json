We know \u00acP (the smonk must not be plagged).\n2. We also know V \u2228 P (either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged).\n\nGiven \u00acP, we can substitute \u00acP into the disjunction V \u2228 P:\n\n- Since P is false (\u00acP is true), the disjunction V \u2228 P simplifies to V \u2228 false, which is just V.\n\nTherefore, if \u00acP is true and V \u2228 P is true, V must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
