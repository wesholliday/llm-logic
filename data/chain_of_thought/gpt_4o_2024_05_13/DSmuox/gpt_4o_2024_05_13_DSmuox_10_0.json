From the first statement, we have \u00acG.\n2. From the second statement, we have S \u2228 G.\n\nGiven \u00acG (the wug is not garpled), we can substitute \u00acG into the second statement:\n\nS \u2228 G becomes S \u2228 False (since G is false).\n\nThis simplifies to S (since anything ORed with False is just the other term).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that S (the wug is sproinged).\n\nAnswer: yes",
