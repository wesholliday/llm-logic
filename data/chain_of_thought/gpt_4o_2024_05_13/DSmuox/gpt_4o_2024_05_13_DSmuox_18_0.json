The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acN (where N stands for \"the shank must be nugged\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\"\n   - This can be written as: P \u2228 N (where P stands for \"the shank is plooked\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer P (the shank is plooked) from \u00acN and P \u2228 N.\n\n3. From \u00acN, we know that N is false.\n   - Therefore, N = false.\n\n4. Given P \u2228 N, and knowing that N is false, the disjunction (P \u2228 N) can only be true if P is true.\n   - Since N is false, P must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that P (the shank is plooked) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
