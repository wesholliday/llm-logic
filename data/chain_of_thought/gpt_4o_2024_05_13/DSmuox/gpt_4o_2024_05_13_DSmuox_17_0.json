From the first statement, we have \u00acM.\n2. From the second statement, we have S \u2228 M.\n\nGiven \u00acM (the flob is not required to be movated), we can substitute \u00acM into the second statement:\n\nS \u2228 M becomes S \u2228 \u00acM.\n\nSince \u00acM is true (from the first statement), the disjunction S \u2228 \u00acM must be true. In a disjunction (OR statement), if one part is true, the whole statement is true. Here, \u00acM is true, so S \u2228 \u00acM is true regardless of the value of S.\n\nHowever, this does not necessarily mean that S (the flob is skizzled) is true. It only means that the disjunction S \u2228 \u00acM is true because \u00acM is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that S (the flob is skizzled) is true based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
