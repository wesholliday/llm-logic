We know \u00acD (the sprocket must not be daggled).\n2. We also know C \u2228 D (either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled).\n\nGiven \u00acD, we can substitute \u00acD into the disjunction C \u2228 D:\n\n- Since D is false (\u00acD is true), the disjunction C \u2228 D simplifies to C \u2228 false, which is just C.\n\nTherefore, from \u00acD and C \u2228 D, we can infer C.\n\nAnswer: yes",
