B \u2228 S\n\nGiven \u00acS (the fleeg must not be surned), we can substitute \u00acS into the second statement:\n- B \u2228 S becomes B \u2228 \u00acS.\n\nSince \u00acS is true (from statement 1), the disjunction B \u2228 \u00acS will be true if either B is true or \u00acS is true. Since we know \u00acS is true, the disjunction is true regardless of the truth value of B.\n\nHowever, the truth of the disjunction B \u2228 \u00acS does not necessarily mean that B is true. It only means that at least one of B or \u00acS is true. Since we already know \u00acS is true, we cannot definitively conclude that B is true based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that \"The fleeg is bluttered\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
