The first statement is: \"It's not the case that the twonk must be plinked.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00ac(Twonk must be plinked).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the twonk is varnished or it must be plinked.\"\n   - This can be written as: (Twonk is varnished) \u2228 (Twonk must be plinked).\n\nNow, let's use these statements to see if we can infer 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nFrom the first statement, we have:\n\u00ac(Twonk must be plinked).\n\nFrom the second statement, we have:\n(Twonk is varnished) \u2228 (Twonk must be plinked).\n\nGiven \u00ac(Twonk must be plinked), the second statement simplifies to:\n(Twonk is varnished) \u2228 False.\n\nSince anything ORed with False is just the other part, this simplifies to:\nTwonk is varnished.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that 'The twonk is varnished'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
