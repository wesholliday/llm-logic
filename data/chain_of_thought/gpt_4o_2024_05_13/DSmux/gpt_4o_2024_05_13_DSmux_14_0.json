The first statement is: \"Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\vee Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The clug is fleeked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The clug must be snugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the clug must be snugged.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) means \"It is not true that the clug must be snugged.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (The clug is fleeked) from \\( P \\vee Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( P \\vee Q \\) and we know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then \\( P \\) must be true.\n\n4. Given:\n   - \\( P \\vee Q \\) (Either the clug is fleeked or it must be snugged)\n   - \\( \\neg Q \\) (It's not the case that the clug must be snugged)\n\n5. From \\( P \\vee Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
