The first statement is: \"Either the zinger is fraggled or it must be smoogled.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( F \\lor S \\)\n     - \\( F \\): The zinger is fraggled.\n     - \\( S \\): The zinger must be smoogled.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the zinger must be smoogled.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n     - \\( \\neg S \\): The zinger is not required to be smoogled.\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( F \\) (The zinger is fraggled) from \\( F \\lor S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( F \\lor S \\) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\\( \\neg S \\)), then the other disjunct must be true.\n\n4. Given \\( F \\lor S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\):\n   - Since \\( S \\) is false (\\( \\neg S \\)), the only way for the disjunction \\( F \\lor S \\) to be true is if \\( F \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \\( F \\) (The zinger is fraggled) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
