The first statement is: \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( S \\lor P \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n     - And \\( P \\) represents \"The grommet must be plopped.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"It is not the case that the grommet must be plopped.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The grommet is sploffed) from \\( S \\lor P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( S \\lor P \\) (either \\( S \\) or \\( P \\)) and \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)), we can conclude \\( S \\) (the other disjunct must be true).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S \\lor P \\)\n- \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nWe can infer:\n- \\( S \\)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the rules of disjunctive syllogism, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
