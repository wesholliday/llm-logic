The first statement is: \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     - Where \\( A \\) is \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n     - And \\( B \\) is \"The dreb must be spened.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the dreb must be spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"It is not the case that the dreb must be spened.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (The dreb is vroombed) from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either A or B is true) and \\( \\neg B \\) (B is not true), then \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, given:\n- \\( A \\lor B \\) (Either the dreb is vroombed or it must be spened)\n- \\( \\neg B \\) (It's not the case that the dreb must be spened)\n\nWe can logically infer:\n- \\( A \\) (The dreb is vroombed)\n\nAnswer: yes",
