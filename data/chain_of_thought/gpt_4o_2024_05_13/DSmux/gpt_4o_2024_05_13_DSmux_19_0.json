The first statement is: \"Either the smonk is vreebled or it must be plagged.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The smonk is vreebled\" and \\( B \\) is \"The smonk must be plagged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the smonk must be plagged.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"It is not true that the smonk must be plagged.\"\n\nNow, let's use these representations to infer the conclusion.\n\n3. We have \\( A \\lor B \\) (Either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and \\( \\neg B \\) (Not \\( B \\)).\n\n4. In logic, if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can infer \\( A \\). This is because if \\( B \\) is false, the only way for \\( A \\lor B \\) to be true is if \\( A \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can infer \\( A \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
