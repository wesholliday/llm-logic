The first statement is: \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( B \\lor Z \\)\n     - Where \\( B \\) stands for \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n     - And \\( Z \\) stands for \"The flugel must be zargled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg Z \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg Z \\) stands for \"It is not the case that the flugel must be zargled.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (The flugel is blimmed) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement, \\( B \\lor Z \\), at least one of \\( B \\) or \\( Z \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement, \\( \\neg Z \\), \\( Z \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( Z \\) is false, then the only way for \\( B \\lor Z \\) to be true is if \\( B \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( Z \\) is false and \\( B \\lor Z \\) must be true, we can conclude that \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
