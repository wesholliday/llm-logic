The first statement is: \"Either the shank is plooked or it must be nugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor N \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the shank is plooked.\"\n     - And \\( N \\) represents \"the shank must be nugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the shank must be nugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg N \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg N \\) represents \"the shank is not nugged.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (the shank is plooked) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement \\( P \\lor N \\), at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( N \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement \\( \\neg N \\), \\( N \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( N \\) is false, then the only way for \\( P \\lor N \\) to be true is if \\( P \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( N \\) is false and \\( P \\lor N \\) must be true, we can conclude that \\( P \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
