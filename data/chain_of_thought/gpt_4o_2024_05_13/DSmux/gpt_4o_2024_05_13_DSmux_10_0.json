The first statement is: \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"The wug must be garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) means \"It is not the case that the wug must be garpled.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (The wug is sproinged) from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\)) and \\( \\neg Q \\) (not \\( Q \\)), we can infer \\( P \\).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n- \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- \\( P \\)\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the wug is sproinged or it must be garpled\" and \"It's not the case that the wug must be garpled,\" we can indeed infer \"The wug is sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
