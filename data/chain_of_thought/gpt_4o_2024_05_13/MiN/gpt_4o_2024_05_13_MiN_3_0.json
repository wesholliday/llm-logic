'The book might not have been written by James':\n   - This means there is a possibility that James did not write the book. It does not definitively state that James did not write it, only that it is possible he did not.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the book must have been written by James':\n   - This means it is not necessarily true that James wrote the book. In other words, it is not a certainty that James is the author.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement suggests a possibility that James did not write the book.\n- The second statement suggests that it is not a certainty that James wrote the book.\n\nSince the first statement implies that there is a possibility James did not write the book, it aligns with the idea that it is not a certainty that James wrote the book. Therefore, the first statement supports the second statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
