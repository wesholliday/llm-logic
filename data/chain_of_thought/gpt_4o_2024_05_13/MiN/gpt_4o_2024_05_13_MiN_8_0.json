'The vampire might not have been awake' suggests that there is a possibility that the vampire was not awake. This means that it is not certain that the vampire was awake; there is a chance that the vampire was asleep.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake' means that it is not necessarily true that the vampire was awake. In other words, it is possible that the vampire was not awake.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement indicates a possibility (the vampire might not have been awake).\n- The second statement indicates that it is not a necessity (the vampire must have been awake is not true).\n\nSince both statements convey that it is not certain that the vampire was awake, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
