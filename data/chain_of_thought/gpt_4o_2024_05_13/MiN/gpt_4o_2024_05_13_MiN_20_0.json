'The sunglasses might not be in her bag' suggests that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag. This means that it is not certain that the sunglasses are in her bag; they could be elsewhere.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag' means that it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be in her bag. This implies that there is no requirement or certainty that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nSince 'The sunglasses might not be in her bag' indicates a lack of certainty about the sunglasses being in her bag, it aligns with the idea that it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be in her bag.
