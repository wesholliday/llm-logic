'The griffin might not have been in the forest' suggests that there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest. This means that it is not certain that the griffin was in the forest; it could have been elsewhere.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest' means that it is not necessary for the griffin to have been in the forest. This implies that there is no requirement or certainty that the griffin was in the forest.\n\nBoth statements express a lack of certainty about the griffin's presence in the forest. The first statement indicates a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest, while the second statement indicates that it is not necessary for the griffin to have been in the forest.\n\nSince both statements convey that the griffin's presence in the forest is not certain, we can infer 'It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest' from 'The griffin might not have been in the forest'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
