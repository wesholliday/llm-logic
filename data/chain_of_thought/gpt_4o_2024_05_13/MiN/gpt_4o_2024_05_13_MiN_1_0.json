'Mary might not have been at the wedding' suggests that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding. This means there is uncertainty about her attendance; she could have been there, or she might not have been there.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding' means that it is not necessarily true that Mary had to be at the wedding. In other words, it is not a certainty that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement indicates a possibility of Mary not being at the wedding.\n- The second statement indicates that it is not a certainty that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, it aligns with the idea that it is not a certainty that she was there. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
