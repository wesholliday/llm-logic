'The toy might not be in the toy box' suggests that there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box. This means that it is not certain that the toy is in the toy box; it could be elsewhere.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box' means that it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box. This implies that the toy could be in the toy box, but it is not required to be there.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement indicates a possibility (the toy might not be in the toy box).\n- The second statement indicates a lack of necessity (the toy does not have to be in the toy box).\n\nSince the first statement allows for the possibility that the toy is not in the toy box, it aligns with the idea that it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box. Therefore, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
