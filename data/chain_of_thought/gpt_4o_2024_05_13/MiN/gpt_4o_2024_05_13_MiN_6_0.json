It implies that it is not certain whether Sue chose pizza or not; she could have chosen something else.\n\n2. \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\" means that it is not necessarily true that Sue had to choose pizza. This statement suggests that there is no requirement or certainty that Sue chose pizza.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n\n- The first statement (\"Sue might not have chosen pizza\") indicates uncertainty about Sue's choice, allowing for the possibility that she did not choose pizza.\n- The second statement (\"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza\") also indicates that there is no certainty or necessity that Sue chose pizza.\n\nSince both statements convey a lack of certainty about Sue choosing pizza, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
