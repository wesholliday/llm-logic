'Lisa might not have bought the red shirt' suggests that there is a possibility that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This means that it is not certain that she bought it; she may or may not have bought it.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt' means that it is not necessary or certain that Lisa bought the red shirt. This implies that there is no requirement or certainty that she bought it.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement indicates a possibility of not buying the shirt, which inherently means that it is not certain that she bought it.\n- The second statement directly states that it is not certain that she bought it.\n\nSince both statements convey that it is not certain that Lisa bought the red shirt, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
