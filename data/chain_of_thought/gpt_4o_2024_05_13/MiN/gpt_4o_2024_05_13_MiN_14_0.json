'The milk might not be on the counter' suggests that there is a possibility that the milk is not on the counter. This means that it is not certain that the milk is on the counter; it could be somewhere else.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter' means that it is not necessary for the milk to be on the counter. There is no requirement or obligation for the milk to be on the counter.\n\nIf the milk might not be on the counter, then it is not necessarily true that the milk must be on the counter. Therefore, the possibility that the milk is not on the counter implies that it is not required for the milk to be on the counter.\n\nAnswer: yes",
