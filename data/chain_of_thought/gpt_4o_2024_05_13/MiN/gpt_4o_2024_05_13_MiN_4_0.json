'The alien might not have visited Mars':\n   - This means there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars. It does not definitively state that the alien did not visit Mars, only that it is possible.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars':\n   - This means it is not necessary or certain that the alien visited Mars. There is no requirement or compulsion for the alien to have visited Mars.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement suggests that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars, which implies that it is not certain or necessary that the alien visited Mars.\n- The second statement directly states that it is not necessary or certain that the alien visited Mars.\n\nSince both statements convey that it is not a requirement or certainty that the alien visited Mars, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
