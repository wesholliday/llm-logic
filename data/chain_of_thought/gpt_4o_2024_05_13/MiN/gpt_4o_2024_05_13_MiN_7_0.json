'Alex might not have finished the race' suggests that there is a possibility that Alex did not finish the race. This means that it is not certain whether Alex finished the race or not.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that Alex must have finished the race' means that it is not necessarily true that Alex finished the race. In other words, it is not a certainty that Alex finished the race.\n\nNow, let's compare the two statements:\n- The first statement indicates uncertainty about whether Alex finished the race.\n- The second statement also indicates that it is not certain that Alex finished the race.\n\nSince both statements convey a lack of certainty about Alex finishing the race, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
