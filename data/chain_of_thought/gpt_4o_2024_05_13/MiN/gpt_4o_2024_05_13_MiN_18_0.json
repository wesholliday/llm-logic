'The notebook might not be in the drawer' means that it is possible that the notebook is not in the drawer. This implies that there is a possibility that the notebook is not in the drawer, but it does not definitively state that the notebook is not in the drawer.\n\n2. 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer' means that it is not necessary for the notebook to be in the drawer. This implies that there is no requirement for the notebook to be in the drawer, which aligns with the possibility that the notebook might not be in the drawer.\n\nSince 'The notebook might not be in the drawer' suggests that it is not certain or required for the notebook to be in the drawer, we can infer that 'It's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
