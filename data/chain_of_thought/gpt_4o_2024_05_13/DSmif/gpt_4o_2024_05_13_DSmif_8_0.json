            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table, let's break down the given statements and apply logical reasoning.\n\n1. The first statement is a disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement):\n   - \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\vee B \\)\n     - \\( A \\): The remote control is hiding under the couch.\n     - \\( B \\): The remote control is on the coffee table.\n\n2. The second statement is a negation:\n   - \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (the remote control is on the coffee table) from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nIn logical terms:\n- We have \\( A \\vee B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) is true).\n- We also have \\( \\neg A \\) ( \\( A \\) is not true).\n\nGiven \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), the only way for the disjunction \\( A \\vee B \\) to hold true is if \\( B \\) is true. This is because if \\( A \\) is false (as given by \\( \\neg A \\)), then \\( B \\) must be true for the disjunction \\( A \\vee B \\) to be true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that \\( B \\) is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
