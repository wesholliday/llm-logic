The first statement is: \"Either the phone must be ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     - \\( P \\): The phone is ringing in the kitchen.\n     - \\( Q \\): The phone is in the living room.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - \\( \\neg P \\): The phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( Q \\) (The phone is in the living room) from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n4. According to the rules of logical inference, specifically disjunctive syllogism, if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\)) and \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)), we can conclude \\( Q \\).\n\n5. Applying this rule:\n   - We have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room).\n   - We also have \\( \\neg P \\) (The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen).\n\n6. Therefore, by disjunctive syllogism, we can infer \\( Q \\) (The phone is in the living room).\n\nAnswer: yes",
