The first statement is: \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The keys are dangling in the cabinet\" and \\( B \\) is \"The keys are in the drawer.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( B \\) (the keys are in the drawer) logically follows from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either A or B is true) and \\( \\neg A \\) (A is not true), then B must be true.\n\nTherefore, given:\n- \\( A \\lor B \\) (Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer)\n- \\( \\neg A \\) (The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet)\n\nWe can infer:\n- \\( B \\) (The keys are in the drawer)\n\nAnswer: yes",
