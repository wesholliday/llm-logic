The first statement is: \"Either the umbrella must be tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     - Where \\( A \\) is \"The umbrella is tucked away in the closet.\"\n     - And \\( B \\) is \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg A \\) means \"The umbrella is not tucked away in the closet.\"\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (\"The umbrella is in the car\") from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n4. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( A \\lor B \\) and we know that \\( A \\) is false (\\( \\neg A \\)), then \\( B \\) must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\n5. Given \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), we can conclude \\( B \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical reasoning, we can infer that \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
