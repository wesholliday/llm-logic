The first statement is: \"Either the missing sock must be under the bed or it's in the laundry basket.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The missing sock is under the bed\" and \\( B \\) is \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The missing sock isn't under the bed.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (the missing sock is in the laundry basket) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logical inference:\n- From \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and \\( \\neg A \\) (not \\( A \\)), we can infer \\( B \\) (the missing sock is in the laundry basket).\n\nThis is because if one of the two possibilities (the sock being under the bed) is ruled out, the only remaining possibility must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
