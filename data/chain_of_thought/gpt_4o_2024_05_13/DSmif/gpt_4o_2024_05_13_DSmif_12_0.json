It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n     - The jacket is hanging in the closet.\n     - The jacket is draped over the chair.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet.\"\n   - This indicates that it is possible that the jacket is not hanging in the closet. However, it does not definitively state that the jacket is not hanging in the closet; it only suggests a possibility.\n\nTo infer \"The jacket is draped over the chair,\" we need to establish that the jacket is definitely not hanging in the closet. However, Statement 2 only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the jacket is draped over the chair based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
