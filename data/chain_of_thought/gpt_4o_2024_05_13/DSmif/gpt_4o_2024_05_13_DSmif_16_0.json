It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the pen is on the desk, or the pen is in the bag, or both.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The pen might not be on my desk.\"\n   - This statement indicates a possibility, not a certainty. It means that it is possible that the pen is not on the desk, but it does not definitively state that the pen is not on the desk.\n\nTo infer \"The pen is in my bag,\" we need to establish that the pen is definitely not on the desk. However, Statement 2 only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the pen is in the bag based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
