It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the milk is chilling in the fridge, or it is on the counter.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The milk might not be chilling in the fridge.\"\n   - This statement introduces a possibility but does not definitively state that the milk is not in the fridge. It means that it is possible that the milk is not in the fridge, but it does not confirm it.\n\nTo infer \"The milk is on the counter,\" we need to establish that the milk is definitely not in the fridge. However, Statement 2 only suggests a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the milk is on the counter based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
