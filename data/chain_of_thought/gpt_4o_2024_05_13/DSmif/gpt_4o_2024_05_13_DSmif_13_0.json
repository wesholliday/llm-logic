It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n     - The toy is on the bookshelf.\n     - The toy is in the toy box.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf.\"\n   - This statement introduces a possibility but does not confirm anything definitively. It suggests that it is possible that the toy is not on the bookshelf, but it does not rule out the possibility that the toy could still be on the bookshelf.\n\nTo infer 'The toy is in the toy box,' we need to establish that the toy is definitely not on the bookshelf. However, Statement 2 only indicates a possibility, not a certainty. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the toy is in the toy box based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
