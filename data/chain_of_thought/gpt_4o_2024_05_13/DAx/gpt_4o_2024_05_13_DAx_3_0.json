            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The splat did not quank' from the given statements, let's analyze the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( M \\) represents \"The splat was morphed.\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) represents \"The splat quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg Q \\) (The splat did not quank) from \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg M \\).\n\nIn logic, \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) (If \\( M \\), then \\( Q \\)) does not provide any information about what happens when \\( M \\) is false. The implication \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. It does not tell us anything about \\( Q \\) when \\( M \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, from \\( \\neg M \\) alone, we cannot infer \\( \\neg Q \\). The splat not being morphed does not necessarily mean that the splat did not quank; it simply means that the condition for the implication \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) is not met.\n\nAnswer: no",
