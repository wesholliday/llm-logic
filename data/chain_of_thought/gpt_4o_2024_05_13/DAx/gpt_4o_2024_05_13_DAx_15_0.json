The first statement is: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( V \\) represents \"the dreb was vroombed\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg V \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg S \\) (the dreb was not spened) from these statements.\n\n3. The logical implication \\( V \\rightarrow S \\) means that if \\( V \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if \\( V \\) is false.\n\n4. The second statement \\( \\neg V \\) tells us that \\( V \\) is false, but it does not provide any direct information about \\( S \\).\n\n5. In logic, from \\( V \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg V \\), we cannot infer \\( \\neg S \\). The truth value of \\( S \\) is undetermined when \\( V \\) is false. \\( S \\) could be either true or false independently of \\( V \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The dreb was not spened' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
