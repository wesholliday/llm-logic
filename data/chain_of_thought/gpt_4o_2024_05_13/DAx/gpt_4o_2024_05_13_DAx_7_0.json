The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Where P is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and Q is \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The whiffle was not shanked.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - Not P (\u00acP)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The whiffle did not tink\" (\u00acQ) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q) is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning if the original statement is true, so is the contrapositive.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide information about what happens if P is false (\u00acP). The conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) only tells us what happens if P is true. When P is false, the conditional statement does not provide any information about Q. Therefore, from \u00acP alone, we cannot infer anything about Q.\n\nGiven:\n- P \u2192 Q (If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked)\n- \u00acP (The whiffle was not shanked)\n\nWe cannot infer \u00acQ (The whiffle did not tink) because the conditional statement does not specify what happens when P is false.\n\nAnswer: no",
