The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Where P is \"the flob was skizzled\" and Q is \"the flob movated.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flob was not skizzled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - Not P (\u00acP)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acQ (the flob was not movated) from P \u2192 Q and \u00acP.\n\nIn logic, from P \u2192 Q and \u00acP, we cannot directly infer \u00acQ. This is because the truth of Q is not dependent solely on P being true or false. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if P is true, but it does not provide information about what happens if P is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot conclude \u00acQ from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
