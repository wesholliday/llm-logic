The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow P \\)\n   - Where \\( V \\) represents \"the smonk was vreebled\" and \\( P \\) represents \"the smonk plagged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg V \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (the smonk was not plagged) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( V \\rightarrow P \\) and \\( \\neg V \\), we cannot directly infer \\( \\neg P \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( V \\rightarrow P \\) only tells us what happens if \\( V \\) is true. It does not provide information about what happens if \\( V \\) is false. \n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- If it rains (V), then the ground gets wet (P).\n- It did not rain (\\( \\neg V \\)).\n\nFrom these statements, we cannot conclude that the ground is not wet (\\( \\neg P \\)). The ground could be wet for other reasons, such as someone watering it.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer that the smonk was not plagged.\n\nAnswer: no",
