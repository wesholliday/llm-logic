The first statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow G \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the wug was sproinged\" and \\( G \\) represents \"the wug was garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg G \\) (the wug was not garpled) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) and \\( \\neg S \\), we cannot directly infer \\( \\neg G \\). This is because the implication \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) only tells us what happens if \\( S \\) is true. It does not provide information about what happens if \\( S \\) is false. \n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- If the statement were \"If it rains, then the ground will be wet\" (\\( R \\rightarrow W \\)), and we know \"It did not rain\" (\\( \\neg R \\)), we cannot conclude that \"The ground is not wet\" (\\( \\neg W \\)). The ground could be wet for other reasons, such as someone watering it.\n\nTherefore, from \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) and \\( \\neg S \\), we cannot infer \\( \\neg G \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
