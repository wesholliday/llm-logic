The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The sprocket was not cranked.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg Q \\) (the sprocket was not daggled) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot directly infer \\( \\neg Q \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us what happens if \\( P \\) is true. If \\( P \\) is false, the conditional statement does not provide any information about \\( Q \\). \\( Q \\) could be true or false independently of \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg Q \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
