The first statement is: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg Q \\) (\"The grommet did not plop the frink\") can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we cannot directly infer \\( \\neg Q \\). This is because \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us what happens if \\( P \\) is true, but it does not provide information about what happens if \\( P \\) is false. Therefore, \\( Q \\) could still be true or false independently of \\( P \\).\n\nThus, we cannot infer \\( \\neg Q \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
