The first statement is: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow S \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents \"the sneg was crampled\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The sneg was not crampled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( \\neg S \\) (the sneg did not sprot the frink) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( C \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg C \\), we cannot directly infer \\( \\neg S \\). This is because \\( C \\rightarrow S \\) only tells us what happens if \\( C \\) is true. If \\( C \\) is false, \\( S \\) could be either true or false; the implication \\( C \\rightarrow S \\) does not provide information about the truth value of \\( S \\) when \\( C \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg S \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
