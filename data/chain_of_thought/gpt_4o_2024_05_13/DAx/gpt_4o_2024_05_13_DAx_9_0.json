The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Where P is \"the twonk was plinked\" and Q is \"the twonk was varnished.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The twonk was not plinked.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - Not P (\u00acP)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"The twonk was not varnished\" (\u00acQ) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) does not provide information about Q if P is false. The truth of Q is independent of the truth of P when P is false. Therefore, from \u00acP alone, we cannot infer \u00acQ.\n\nTo summarize:\n- P \u2192 Q (If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished)\n- \u00acP (The twonk was not plinked)\n\nFrom these, we cannot conclude \u00acQ (The twonk was not varnished).\n\nAnswer: no",
