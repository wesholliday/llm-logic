The first statement is: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow T \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the glip was slogged\"\n     - And \\( T \\) represents \"the glip was tragged\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg T \\) (the glip was not tragged) from \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) and \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nIn logic, the implication \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) means that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( T \\) must also be true. However, if \\( S \\) is false, the implication \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( T \\). \n\nGiven \\( \\neg S \\) (the glip was not slogged), we cannot conclude anything about \\( T \\) (whether the glip was tragged or not) because the implication \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) does not specify what happens when \\( S \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg T \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
