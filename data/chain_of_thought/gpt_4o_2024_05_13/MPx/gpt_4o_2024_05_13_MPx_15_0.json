The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The dreb was vroombed.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - P\n\nNow, we need to determine if Q (\"The dreb was spened\") logically follows from these statements.\n\n- According to the rules of logical inference, specifically Modus Ponens, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q must also be true.\n\nGiven:\n- P \u2192 Q (If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened)\n- P (The dreb was vroombed)\n\nBy Modus Ponens, we can infer:\n- Q (The dreb was spened)\n\nAnswer: yes",
