The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The wug was flooped\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug was flooped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, we have:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( P \\)\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know that \\( P \\) is true, we can infer that \\( Q \\) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nTherefore, from the statements:\n- \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n- \"The wug was flooped.\"\n\nWe can infer:\n- \"The wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
