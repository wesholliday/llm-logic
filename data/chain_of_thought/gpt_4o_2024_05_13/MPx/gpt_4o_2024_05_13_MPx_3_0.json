The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The splat was morphed\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The splat quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The splat was morphed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( Q \\) (The splat quanked) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nIn propositional logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know that \\( P \\) is true, we can use a rule called \"modus ponens\" to infer that \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked)\n- \\( P \\) (The splat was morphed)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can infer:\n- \\( Q \\) (The splat quanked)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical reasoning, we can infer that \"The splat quanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
