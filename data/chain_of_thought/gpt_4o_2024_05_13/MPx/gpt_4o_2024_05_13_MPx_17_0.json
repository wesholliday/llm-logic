The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Where P is \"the flob was skizzled\" and Q is \"the flob movated.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flob was skizzled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - P\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer Q (\"the flob movated\") from these two statements.\n\nAccording to the rules of logical inference, specifically Modus Ponens, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that P is true, we can infer that Q is true.\n\nGiven:\n- P \u2192 Q (If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated)\n- P (The flob was skizzled)\n\nBy Modus Ponens, we can infer:\n- Q (The flob movated)\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The flob movated.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
