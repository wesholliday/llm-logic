The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"the twonk was plinked\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"it was varnished\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The twonk was plinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( Q \\) (\"it was varnished\") can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know that \\( P \\) is true, then we can conclude that \\( Q \\) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished)\n- \\( P \\) (The twonk was plinked)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can infer:\n- \\( Q \\) (It was varnished)\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"It was varnished\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
