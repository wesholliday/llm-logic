The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The clug was fleeked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The clug snugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The clug was fleeked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \"The clug snugged\" from these statements.\n   - In logical terms, we need to see if \\( Q \\) follows from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( P \\).\n\nAccording to the rules of logical inference, specifically Modus Ponens:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\)) is true, and \\( P \\) (the antecedent) is true, then \\( Q \\) (the consequent) must also be true.\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged)\n2. \\( P \\) (The clug was fleeked)\n\nBy Modus Ponens, we can infer:\n- \\( Q \\) (The clug snugged)\n\nAnswer: yes",
