The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Where P is \"The zinger was fraggled\" and Q is \"The zinger was smoogled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The zinger was fraggled.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - P\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer Q from these statements.\n\n- According to the rules of logical inference, specifically Modus Ponens, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nGiven:\n- P \u2192 Q (If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled)\n- P (The zinger was fraggled)\n\nBy Modus Ponens:\n- Q (The zinger was smoogled)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
