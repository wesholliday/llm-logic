The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q)\n   - Where P is \"The glip was slogged\" and Q is \"The glip was tragged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The glip was slogged.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - P\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer Q (\"The glip was tragged\") from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement (P \u2192 Q) and we know that P is true, then we can conclude that Q must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nGiven:\n- P \u2192 Q (If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged)\n- P (The glip was slogged)\n\nWe can infer:\n- Q (The glip was tragged)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the given statements, we can infer that \"The glip was tragged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
