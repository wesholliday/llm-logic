The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The fribble was snurgled\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The fribble crinked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fribble was snurgled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( Q \\) (\"The fribble crinked\") can be inferred from these statements.\n\nIn logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know that \\( P \\) is true, then we can conclude that \\( Q \\) must also be true. This is known as modus ponens.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- \\( P \\)\n\nWe can infer:\n- \\( Q \\)\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" and \"The fribble was snurgled,\" we can infer \"The fribble crinked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
