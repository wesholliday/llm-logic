It states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if P then Q) and \\( P \\) (P is true), then \\( Q \\) (Q is true).\n   - In our case:\n     - \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) (If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged)\n     - \\( P \\) (The shank was plooked)\n   - Therefore, we can infer \\( N \\) (The shank was nugged).\n\nBased on the logical reasoning above, we can indeed infer \"The shank was nugged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
