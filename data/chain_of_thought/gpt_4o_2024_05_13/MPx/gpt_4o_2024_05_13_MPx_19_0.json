The first statement is: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"The smonk was vreebled\" and \\( B \\) is \"The smonk plagged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The smonk was vreebled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( B \\) (i.e., \"The smonk plagged\") can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( A \\).\n\nIn propositional logic, if we have \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) (if \\( A \\) then \\( B \\)) and \\( A \\) (the antecedent is true), we can use the rule of modus ponens to conclude \\( B \\) (the consequent is true).\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\" and \"The smonk was vreebled,\" we can infer \"The smonk plagged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
