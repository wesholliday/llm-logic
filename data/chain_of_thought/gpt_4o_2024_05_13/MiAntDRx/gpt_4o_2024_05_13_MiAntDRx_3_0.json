            "content": "Explanation: The original statement is \"The fribble might be in the blurble or on the wumble.\" This statement presents two possibilities for the location of the fribble: it might be in the blurble, or it might be on the wumble. The use of \"or\" indicates that either one of these conditions could be true. Therefore, it is possible that the fribble is on the wumble, even though it is not certain. The word \"might\" indicates possibility rather than certainty.\n\nGiven that one of the possibilities mentioned is that the fribble might be on the wumble, we can infer that this is indeed a possible location for the fribble.\n\nAnswer: yes",
