The original statement provides two possible locations for the quibble: it might be on the quibble or it might be in the fizzle. Since one of the options explicitly states that the quibble might be in the fizzle, we can directly infer that 'The quibble might be in the fizzle' is a valid conclusion based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes",
