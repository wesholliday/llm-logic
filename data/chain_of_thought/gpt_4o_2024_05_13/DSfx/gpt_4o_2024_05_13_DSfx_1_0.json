The first statement is: \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"The flugel is zargled\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flugel is not zargled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( Q \\) (i.e., \"The flugel is blimmed\") from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) is true) and \\( \\neg P \\) ( \\( P \\) is not true), then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed\" and \"The flugel is not zargled,\" we can infer that \"The flugel is blimmed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
