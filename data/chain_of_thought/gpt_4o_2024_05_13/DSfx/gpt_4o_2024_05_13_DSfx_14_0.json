The first statement is: \"Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( S \\lor F \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents \"The clug is snugged\" and \\( F \\) represents \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The clug is not snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( F \\) (The clug is fleeked) can be inferred from \\( S \\lor F \\) and \\( \\neg S \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( S \\lor F \\) (either \\( S \\) or \\( F \\)) and \\( \\neg S \\) (not \\( S \\)), we can conclude \\( F \\) (because if \\( S \\) is false, \\( F \\) must be true for the disjunction \\( S \\lor F \\) to hold true).\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the clug is snugged or it is fleeked\" and \"The clug is not snugged,\" we can infer \"The clug is fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
