The first statement is: \"Either the twonk is varnished or it is plinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( V \\lor P \\)\n   - Where \\( V \\) represents \"The twonk is varnished\" and \\( P \\) represents \"The twonk is plinked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The twonk is not plinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"The twonk is not plinked.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( V \\) (The twonk is varnished) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement, \\( V \\lor P \\), at least one of \\( V \\) or \\( P \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement, \\( \\neg P \\), \\( P \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( P \\) is false, then for the disjunction \\( V \\lor P \\) to be true, \\( V \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \\( V \\) (The twonk is varnished) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
