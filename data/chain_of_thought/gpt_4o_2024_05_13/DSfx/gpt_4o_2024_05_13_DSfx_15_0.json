The first statement is: \"Either the dreb is spened or it is vroombed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( A \\vee B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"The dreb is spened\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The dreb is vroombed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The dreb is not spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (The dreb is vroombed) from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( A \\vee B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and we know \\( \\neg A \\) (not \\( A \\)), then \\( B \\) must be true. This is because if one part of an \"or\" statement is false, the other part must be true for the entire statement to hold true.\n\nTherefore, from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), we can infer \\( B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
