The first statement is: \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( D \\lor C \\)\n     - Where \\( D \\) represents \"The sprocket is daggled.\"\n     - And \\( C \\) represents \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The sprocket is not daggled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg D \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( C \\) (The sprocket is cranked) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement \\( D \\lor C \\), at least one of \\( D \\) or \\( C \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement \\( \\neg D \\), \\( D \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( D \\) is false, then for the disjunction \\( D \\lor C \\) to be true, \\( C \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \\( C \\) (The sprocket is cranked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
