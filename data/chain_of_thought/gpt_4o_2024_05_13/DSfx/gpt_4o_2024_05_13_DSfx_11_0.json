The first statement is: \"Either the flug is zimmed or it is blummed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( Z \\lor B \\)\n     where \\( Z \\) represents \"The flug is zimmed\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The flug is blummed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flug is not zimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg Z \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (The flug is blummed) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement, \\( Z \\lor B \\), at least one of \\( Z \\) or \\( B \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement, \\( \\neg Z \\), \\( Z \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( Z \\) is false, then for the disjunction \\( Z \\lor B \\) to be true, \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( Z \\lor B \\) is true and \\( Z \\) is false, we can logically infer that \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
