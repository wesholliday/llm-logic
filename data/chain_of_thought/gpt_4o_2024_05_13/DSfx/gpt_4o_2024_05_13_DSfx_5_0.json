The first statement is: \"Either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( S \\lor F \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"The zinger is smoogled.\"\n     - And \\( F \\) represents \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The zinger is not smoogled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg S \\) means \"not S\" or \"The zinger is not smoogled.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( F \\) (The zinger is fraggled) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunction elimination (also known as the law of excluded middle), if we have \\( S \\lor F \\) and we know \\( \\neg S \\), then \\( F \\) must be true.\n\n   - Given \\( S \\lor F \\) (Either the zinger is smoogled or it is fraggled)\n   - And \\( \\neg S \\) (The zinger is not smoogled)\n   - We can conclude \\( F \\) (The zinger is fraggled)\n\nTherefore, based on the logical structure and the given statements, we can infer that \"The zinger is fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
