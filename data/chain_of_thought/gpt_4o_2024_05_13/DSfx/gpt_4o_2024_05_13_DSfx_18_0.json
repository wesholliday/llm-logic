The first statement is: \"Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( N \\lor P \\)\n     where \\( N \\) stands for \"The shank is nugged\" and \\( P \\) stands for \"The shank is plooked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The shank is not nugged.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg N \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (The shank is plooked) from \\( N \\lor P \\) and \\( \\neg N \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( N \\lor P \\) (either \\( N \\) or \\( P \\)) and \\( \\neg N \\) (not \\( N \\)), we can conclude \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, given the statements:\n- \\( N \\lor P \\)\n- \\( \\neg N \\)\n\nWe can logically infer \\( P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
