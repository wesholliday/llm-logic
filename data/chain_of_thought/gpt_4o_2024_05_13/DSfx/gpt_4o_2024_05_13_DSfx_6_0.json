The first statement is: \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor S \\)\n     where \\( P \\) represents \"The grommet is plopped\" and \\( S \\) represents \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The grommet is not plopped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"The grommet is not plopped.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The grommet is sploffed) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( P \\lor S \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( S \\)) and \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\)), we can use the disjunctive syllogism rule, which states that if one of the disjuncts is false, the other must be true.\n\n4. Applying the disjunctive syllogism:\n   - From \\( P \\lor S \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we can infer \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that \"The grommet is sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
