The first statement \\( L \\lor S \\) tells us that at least one of \\( L \\) or \\( S \\) must be true.\n2. The second statement \\( \\neg L \\) tells us that \\( L \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg L \\) (the smip is not lupped), we can substitute this into the first statement:\n\n- Since \\( L \\) is false, the first statement \\( L \\lor S \\) simplifies to \\( \\text{false} \\lor S \\).\n\nIn logical terms, \\( \\text{false} \\lor S \\) simplifies to \\( S \\) because the disjunction (OR) of false and any statement \\( S \\) is just \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, if \\( L \\) is false, \\( S \\) must be true to satisfy the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
