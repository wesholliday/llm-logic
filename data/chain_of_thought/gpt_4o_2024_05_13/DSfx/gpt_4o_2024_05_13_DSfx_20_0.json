The first statement is: \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( S \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"The fleeg is surned\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The fleeg is bluttered.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fleeg is not surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"The fleeg is not surned.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (The fleeg is bluttered) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement, \\( S \\lor B \\), at least one of \\( S \\) or \\( B \\) must be true.\n\n4. According to the second statement, \\( \\neg S \\), \\( S \\) is false.\n\n5. If \\( S \\) is false, then for the disjunction \\( S \\lor B \\) to be true, \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( S \\lor B \\) is true and \\( S \\) is false, we can infer that \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
