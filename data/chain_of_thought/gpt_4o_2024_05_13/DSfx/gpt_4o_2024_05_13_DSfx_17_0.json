The first statement is: \"Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( M \\lor S \\)\n     where \\( M \\) stands for \"The flob is movated\" and \\( S \\) stands for \"The flob is skizzled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The flob is not movated.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg M \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The flob is skizzled) from these two statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic:\n- From \\( M \\lor S \\) (either \\( M \\) or \\( S \\)) and \\( \\neg M \\) (not \\( M \\)), we can apply the disjunctive syllogism.\n- Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), then we can conclude \\( B \\).\n\nApplying this to our case:\n- \\( M \\lor S \\) (either \\( M \\) or \\( S \\))\n- \\( \\neg M \\) (not \\( M \\))\n\nBy disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude \\( S \\) (The flob is skizzled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
