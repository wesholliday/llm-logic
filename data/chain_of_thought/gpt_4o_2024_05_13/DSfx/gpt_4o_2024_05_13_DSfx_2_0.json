The first statement is: \"Either the wug is bimmed or it is flooped.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The wug is bimmed\" and \\( B \\) is \"The wug is flooped.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug is not bimmed.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( B \\) (The wug is flooped) logically follows from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic:\n- From \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)), if \\( A \\) is false (\\( \\neg A \\)), then \\( B \\) must be true for the disjunction \\( A \\lor B \\) to hold.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\lor B \\)\n- \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- \\( B \\)\n\nTherefore, \"The wug is flooped\" can be inferred.\n\nAnswer: yes",
