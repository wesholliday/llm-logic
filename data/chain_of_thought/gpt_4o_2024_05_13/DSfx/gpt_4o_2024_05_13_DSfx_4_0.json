The first statement is: \"Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( C \\lor S \\)\n     where \\( C \\) stands for \"The fribble is crinked\" and \\( S \\) stands for \"The fribble is snurgled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The fribble is not crinked.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \"The fribble is snurgled\" (i.e., \\( S \\)) from these statements.\n\nUsing the rules of logic:\n- From \\( C \\lor S \\) (either \\( C \\) or \\( S \\) is true) and \\( \\neg C \\) (not \\( C \\)), we can apply the disjunctive syllogism.\n- Disjunctive syllogism states that if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), then \\( B \\) must be true.\n\nApplying this to our case:\n- \\( C \\lor S \\) (either \\( C \\) or \\( S \\))\n- \\( \\neg C \\) (not \\( C \\))\n\nFrom these, we can conclude \\( S \\) (the fribble is snurgled).\n\nAnswer: yes",
