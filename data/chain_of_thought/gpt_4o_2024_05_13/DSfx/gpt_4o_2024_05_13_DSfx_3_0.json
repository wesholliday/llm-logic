The first statement is: \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( Q \\lor M \\)\n     where \\( Q \\) represents \"The splat is quanked\" and \\( M \\) represents \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The splat is not quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( M \\) (The splat is morphed) from \\( Q \\lor M \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( Q \\lor M \\) (either \\( Q \\) or \\( M \\)) and we know that \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then the only way for the disjunction to be true is if \\( M \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from \\( Q \\lor M \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( M \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
