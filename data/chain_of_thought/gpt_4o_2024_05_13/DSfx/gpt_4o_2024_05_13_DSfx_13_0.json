The first statement is: \"Either the glip is tragged or it is slogged.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( T \\lor S \\)\n     - Where \\( T \\) represents \"The glip is tragged.\"\n     - And \\( S \\) represents \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The glip is not tragged.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg T \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg T \\) means \"The glip is not tragged.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( S \\) (The glip is slogged) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( T \\lor S \\) (either \\( T \\) or \\( S \\)) and \\( \\neg T \\) (not \\( T \\)), we can use the disjunctive syllogism rule, which states that if one part of a disjunction is false, the other part must be true.\n\n4. Applying the disjunctive syllogism:\n   - From \\( T \\lor S \\) and \\( \\neg T \\), we can infer \\( S \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
