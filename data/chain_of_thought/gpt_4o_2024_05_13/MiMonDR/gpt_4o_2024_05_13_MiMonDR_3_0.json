The original statement is 'The keys might be in the car'. This means there is a possibility that the keys are in the car.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The keys might be in the house or in the car'. This means there is a possibility that the keys are either in the house or in the car.\n\nThe key point here is that the original statement only mentions the car, while the inferred statement introduces an additional location (the house). The original statement does not provide any information about the possibility of the keys being in the house. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the additional possibility of the keys being in the house from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
