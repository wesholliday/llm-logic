            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The computer might be broken\" suggests that there is a possibility that the computer is not functioning properly. This implies uncertainty about the computer's status. When we say \"The computer might be working or broken,\" we are covering all possible states of the computer: it could be working, it could be broken, or it could be in some other state of partial functionality. Since \"might be broken\" already implies that there is a possibility of it being broken (and by extension, not broken), it logically follows that the computer might be either working or broken. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
