The word \"might\" indicates uncertainty and implies that success is one of the possible outcomes, but not the only one. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that the project might either succeed or fail, as both are potential outcomes given the uncertainty expressed in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
