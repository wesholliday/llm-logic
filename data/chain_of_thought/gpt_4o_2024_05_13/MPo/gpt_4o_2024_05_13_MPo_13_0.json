            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The truck was blue\" from the given statements, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"The car was red.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n\nIn logical terms, the second statement can be written as: \n\"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"The car was red\" and Q is \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nGiven that P is true (the car was red), and we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q,\" we can apply the rule of modus ponens in logic. Modus ponens states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, since both conditions are met (P is true and \"If P, then Q\" is true), we can infer that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
