The first statement is: \"The shirt was cotton.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nIn logical terms, the second statement can be written as: \n\"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nGiven:\n- P (The shirt was cotton)\n- If P, then Q (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can apply the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if we have \"P\" and \"If P, then Q,\" we can conclude \"Q.\"\n\nTherefore, since we have:\n- P (The shirt was cotton)\n- If P, then Q (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- Q (The pants were denim)\n\nAnswer: yes",
