The first statement is: \"The dog was inside.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n\nIn logical terms, the second statement can be written as: \n\"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the dog was inside\" and Q is \"the cat was outside.\"\n\nGiven that P is true (the dog was inside), we can apply the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if \"If P, then Q\" is true and P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\nSince both conditions are met:\n- \"The dog was inside\" (P is true)\n- \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" (If P, then Q is true)\n\nWe can conclude that Q is true, which means \"The cat was outside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
