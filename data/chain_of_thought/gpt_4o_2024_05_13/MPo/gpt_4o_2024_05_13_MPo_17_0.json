The first statement is \"Ben ate pasta.\"\n2. The second statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\"\n\nIn logical terms, the second statement can be written as:\n- If P, then Q (where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate the salad\").\n\nGiven:\n- P (Ben ate pasta)\n- If P, then Q (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if we have \"P\" and \"If P, then Q,\" we can conclude \"Q.\"\n\nApplying modus ponens:\n- P is true (Ben ate pasta).\n- If P, then Q is true (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude Q:\n- Q (Kate ate the salad).\n\nAnswer: yes",
