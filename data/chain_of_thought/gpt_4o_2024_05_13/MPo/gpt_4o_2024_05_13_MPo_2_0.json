It tells us that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements logically:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that the griffin was in the forest.\n- According to Statement 2, if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest.\n\nSince Statement 1 confirms the condition required by Statement 2, we can conclude that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
