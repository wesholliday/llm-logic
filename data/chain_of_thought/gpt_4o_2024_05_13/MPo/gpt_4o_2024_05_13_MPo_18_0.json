It tells us that if the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, then the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true.\n\n3. **Combining the Statements:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that the condition in the conditional statement (the doll being plastic) is true.\n   - According to the conditional statement (Statement 2), if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true.\n\nSince the condition (the doll being plastic) is true, the consequence (the truck being metal) must also be true based on the given conditional statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
