The first statement is \"Jeff played basketball.\"\n2. The second statement is \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n\nWe can represent these statements in logical form:\n1. \\( P \\) (Jeff played basketball)\n2. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis)\n\nIn logical terms, we need to determine if \\( Q \\) (Amy played tennis) can be inferred from \\( P \\) and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAccording to the rules of logical inference, specifically modus ponens, if we have:\n1. \\( P \\) (Jeff played basketball)\n2. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis)\n\nWe can conclude \\( Q \\) (Amy played tennis).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that Amy played tennis.\n\nAnswer: yes",
