The second statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n\nIn formal logic, the second statement can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where:\n- \\( P \\) represents \"Sam took a plane.\"\n- \\( Q \\) represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\) (Sam took a plane) is true.\n- \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train) is true.\n\nIn classical logic, if \\( P \\) is true and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"Erin took a train.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
