            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'Sue was at the wedding' from the given statements, let's break down the reasoning step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n   - This is a straightforward assertion that Mary attended the wedding.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that Mary's attendance at the wedding implies Sue's attendance at the wedding.\n\nTo infer whether Sue was at the wedding, we need to apply the logical structure of the conditional statement to the fact that Mary was at the wedding.\n\n- According to the conditional statement, the presence of Mary at the wedding (the antecedent) guarantees the presence of Sue at the wedding (the consequent).\n\nSince we know from Statement 1 that Mary was indeed at the wedding, we can apply the conditional statement (Statement 2) to conclude that Sue must also have been at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
