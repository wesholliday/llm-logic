It means that if the condition (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the result (Chris finishing the race) must also be true.\n\n3. **Evaluate the condition:**\n   - According to Statement 1, the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\n4. **Apply the conditional statement:**\n   - Since the condition in the conditional statement is true (Alex finished the race), the result of the conditional statement must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
