It tells us that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the result \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n\n3. **Combining the Statements:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true.\n   - According to Statement 2, if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the result \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must follow.\n\nSince both statements are true and the condition in the second statement is satisfied, we can logically infer that \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
