The first statement is: \"The apple was red.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\nIn logical terms, the second statement can be written as: \"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"The apple was red\" and Q is \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nGiven:\n- P (The apple was red)\n- P \u2192 Q (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if we have P and P \u2192 Q, then we can conclude Q.\n\nSince we have:\n- P (The apple was red)\n- P \u2192 Q (If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- Q (The banana was yellow)\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
