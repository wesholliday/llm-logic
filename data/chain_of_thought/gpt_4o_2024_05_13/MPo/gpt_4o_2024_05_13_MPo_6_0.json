It can be written in the form: If P, then Q.\n   - Here, P is \"Sue chose pizza\" and Q is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n3. **Logical Implication:**\n   - According to the rules of logic, if we know that P is true and we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q,\" we can infer that Q must also be true.\n\n4. **Application:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that P (\"Sue chose pizza\") is true.\n   - From Statement 2, we have the conditional \"If P, then Q\" (\"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\").\n   - Since P is true, and we have the conditional statement, we can infer that Q (\"Bob chose pasta\") must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements and the rules of logical implication, we can infer that \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
