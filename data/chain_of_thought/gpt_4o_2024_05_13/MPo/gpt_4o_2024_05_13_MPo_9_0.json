It tells us that if the condition (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\n3. **Combining the Statements:**\n   - From Statement 1, we know that the condition of the conditional statement in Statement 2 is satisfied (Lisa did buy the red shirt).\n   - According to the conditional statement in Statement 2, if the condition is satisfied, then the consequence must follow.\n\nTherefore, since Lisa bought the red shirt, the condition of the conditional statement is met, and we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes",
