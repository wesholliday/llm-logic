The first statement is: \"The vampire was awake.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nIn logical terms, the second statement can be written as: \n- If P, then Q (where P is \"The vampire was awake\" and Q is \"The mummy was awake\").\n\nGiven:\n- P (The vampire was awake)\n- If P, then Q (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if we have \"P\" and \"If P, then Q,\" we can conclude \"Q.\"\n\nTherefore, since we have:\n- P (The vampire was awake)\n- If P, then Q (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- Q (The mummy was awake)\n\nAnswer: yes",
