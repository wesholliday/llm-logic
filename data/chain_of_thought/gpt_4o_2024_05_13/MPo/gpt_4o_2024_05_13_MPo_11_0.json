The first statement is: \"The cake was chocolate.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nIn logical terms, the second statement can be written as: \n\"If P, then Q,\" where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry.\"\n\nGiven:\n- P (The cake was chocolate)\n- If P, then Q (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry)\n\nFrom these two statements, we can use the rule of modus ponens in logic, which states that if we have \"P\" and \"If P, then Q,\" we can conclude \"Q.\"\n\nSince we have:\n- P (The cake was chocolate)\n- If P, then Q (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- Q (The muffins were blueberry)\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The muffins were blueberry.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
