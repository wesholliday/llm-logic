The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n   where \\( G \\) represents \"The griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( U \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( G \\) (The griffin was in the forest) from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we are given:\n- \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n- \\( U \\)\n\nTo infer \\( G \\) from these, we need to check if the given information logically leads to \\( G \\).\n\nThe conditional statement \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) tells us that if \\( G \\) is true, then \\( U \\) must be true. However, it does not tell us anything about the situation when \\( U \\) is true. \\( U \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( G \\) is true; it only means that if \\( G \\) were true, \\( U \\) would also be true.\n\nTherefore, from \\( U \\) alone, we cannot infer \\( G \\). The truth of \\( U \\) does not provide enough information to conclude the truth of \\( G \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
