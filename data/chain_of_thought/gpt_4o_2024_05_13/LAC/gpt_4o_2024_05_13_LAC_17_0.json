The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Kate ate salad.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Ben ate pasta) can be inferred from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot directly infer \\( P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true. There could be other reasons why \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Ben ate pasta just because Kate ate salad.\n\nAnswer: no",
