The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Erin took a train.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Sam took a plane) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot directly infer \\( P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The fact that \\( Q \\) is true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) must be true; \\( Q \\) could be true for reasons other than \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Sam took a plane based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
