The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   where \\( P \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( Z \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) and \\( Z \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) and \\( Z \\), we cannot infer \\( P \\). The reason is that the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Z \\) only tells us what happens if \\( P \\) is true. It does not provide any information about what happens if \\( Z \\) is true. \\( Z \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) must be true; \\( Z \\) could be true for other reasons unrelated to \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Joe went to the park based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
