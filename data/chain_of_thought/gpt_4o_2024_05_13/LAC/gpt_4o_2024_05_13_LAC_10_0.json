It only tells us what happens if \\( D \\) is true.\n   - Knowing \\( C \\) is true (the cat was outside) does not necessarily mean that \\( D \\) must be true. \\( C \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( D \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the dog was inside based solely on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
