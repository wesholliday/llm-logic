The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( M \\) (Mary was at the wedding) can be logically inferred from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we are given:\n   \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n   \\( S \\)\n\nTo infer \\( M \\) from these statements, we need to check if there is a logical connection that allows us to conclude \\( M \\).\n\nHowever, the conditional statement \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) only tells us that if \\( M \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must be true. It does not provide any information about what happens if \\( S \\) is true. The truth of \\( S \\) alone does not imply the truth of \\( M \\). In other words, \\( S \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( M \\) is true; it only means that if \\( M \\) were true, then \\( S \\) would also be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \\( M \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
