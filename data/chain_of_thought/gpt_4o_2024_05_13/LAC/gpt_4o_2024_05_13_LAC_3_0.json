The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (The book was written by James) can be logically inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\), we cannot directly infer \\( P \\). This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true, as there could be other reasons for \\( Q \\) to be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the book was written by James based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
