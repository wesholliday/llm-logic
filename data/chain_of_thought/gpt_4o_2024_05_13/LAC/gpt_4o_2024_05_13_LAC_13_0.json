The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow T \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) represents \"The car was red\" and \\( T \\) represents \"The truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( C \\) (The car was red) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) and \\( T \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) and \\( T \\), we cannot directly infer \\( C \\). This is because the truth of \\( T \\) (the truck being blue) does not necessarily mean that \\( C \\) (the car being red) is true. The truck could be blue for reasons other than the car being red.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Suppose the truck is blue regardless of the color of the car. The conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow T \\) would still hold true because whenever the car is red, the truck is indeed blue. However, the truck being blue does not provide any information about the color of the car.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the car was red based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
