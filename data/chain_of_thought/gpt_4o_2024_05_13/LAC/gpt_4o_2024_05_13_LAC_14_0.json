The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n   where \\( B \\) represents \"The bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wolf was in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( W \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (The bear was in the cave) from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) and \\( W \\), we cannot directly infer \\( B \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) only tells us what happens if \\( B \\) is true, but it does not provide information about what happens if \\( W \\) is true. \\( W \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( B \\) must be true; \\( W \\) could be true for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the bear was in the cave based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
