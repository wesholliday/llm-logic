The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball) can be inferred from \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( A \\).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) means that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must also be true. However, it does not state what happens if \\( A \\) is true. The truth of \\( A \\) alone does not provide any information about the truth of \\( J \\). \n\nTo infer \\( J \\) from \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( A \\), we would need the converse of the conditional statement, which is \\( A \\rightarrow J \\). However, we do not have this information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically infer that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: no",
