The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If P, then Q (where P is \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q is \"the pants were denim\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The pants were denim.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - Q (where Q is \"the pants were denim\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer P (\"the shirt was cotton\") from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and the statement \"Q,\" we cannot directly infer P. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. The truth of Q does not necessarily imply the truth of P. There could be other reasons why Q is true that do not involve P.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot logically infer that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: no",
