The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) represents \"The apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( B \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( A \\) (The apple was red) can be inferred from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\).\n\nIn logic, from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( B \\), we cannot directly infer \\( A \\). This is because the truth of \\( B \\) does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( A \\). The banana being yellow could be true for reasons other than the apple being red.\n\nTo illustrate this with an example:\n- Suppose the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true.\n- And suppose the banana was indeed yellow.\n- This does not provide any information about whether the apple was red or not. The banana could be yellow regardless of the color of the apple.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the apple was red based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
