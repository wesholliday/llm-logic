The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If \\( C \\) (the cake was chocolate), then \\( M \\) (the muffins were blueberry).\n   - Symbolically: \\( C \\rightarrow M \\).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The muffins were blueberry.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( M \\) (the muffins were blueberry).\n\nWe need to determine if \\( C \\) (the cake was chocolate) logically follows from these statements.\n\nIn logic, from \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\), we cannot directly infer \\( C \\). This is because the conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow M \\) only tells us what happens if \\( C \\) is true, but it does not provide information about what happens if \\( M \\) is true. \\( M \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( C \\) must be true; \\( M \\) could be true for other reasons unrelated to \\( C \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the cake was chocolate based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
