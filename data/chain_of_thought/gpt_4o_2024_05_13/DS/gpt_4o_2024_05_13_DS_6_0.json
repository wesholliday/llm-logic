The first statement is: \"Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"The phone is in the living room.\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"The phone is ringing in the kitchen.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) means \"The phone is not ringing in the kitchen.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( P \\) (The phone is in the living room) can be inferred from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logical inference:\n   - From \\( P \\lor Q \\) (Either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\)) and \\( \\neg Q \\) (Not \\( Q \\)), we can infer \\( P \\) (The phone is in the living room).\n\nThis is because if one of the disjuncts (\\( Q \\)) is false, the other disjunct (\\( P \\)) must be true for the disjunction (\\( P \\lor Q \\)) to hold true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The phone is in the living room.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
