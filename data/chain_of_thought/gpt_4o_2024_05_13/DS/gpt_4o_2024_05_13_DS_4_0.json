The first statement is: \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( C \\lor P \\)\n     - Where \\( C \\) represents \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n     - And \\( P \\) represents \"The cat is playing in the bedroom.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) means \"The cat is not playing in the bedroom.\"\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \"The cat is napping on the couch\" (\\( C \\)) from these statements.\n\n4. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism, if we have a disjunction (\\( C \\lor P \\)) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\\( \\neg P \\)), then the other disjunct must be true (\\( C \\)).\n\n5. Applying this rule:\n   - We have \\( C \\lor P \\) (Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom).\n   - We also have \\( \\neg P \\) (The cat isn't playing in the bedroom).\n\n6. Given \\( \\neg P \\), we can conclude \\( C \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The cat is napping on the couch.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
