            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table, let's break down the statements and analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement):\n   - \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( A \\vee B \\)\n     - Where \\( A \\) is \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n     - And \\( B \\) is \"The remote control is hiding under the couch.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation:\n   - \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( A \\) (the remote control is on the coffee table) can be inferred from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically the disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( A \\vee B \\) (either A or B is true)\n   - And we have \\( \\neg B \\) (B is not true)\n   - Then we can conclude \\( A \\) (A must be true)\n\nSince \\( A \\vee B \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false, \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
