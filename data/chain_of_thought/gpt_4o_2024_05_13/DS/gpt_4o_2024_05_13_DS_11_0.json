The first statement is: \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\vee B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The newspaper is in the driveway\" and \\( B \\) is \"The newspaper is sitting on the porch.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (The newspaper is in the driveway) from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n4. According to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( A \\vee B \\) and we know that \\( B \\) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), then \\( A \\) must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\n5. Therefore, from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can infer \\( A \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
