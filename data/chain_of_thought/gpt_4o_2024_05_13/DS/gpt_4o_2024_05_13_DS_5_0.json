The first statement is: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( C \\lor P \\)\n     - Where \\( C \\) represents \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n     - And \\( P \\) represents \"The cookies are hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) means \"The cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( C \\) (The cookies are in the jar) from \\( C \\lor P \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either A or B) and \\( \\neg B \\) (not B), we can infer \\( A \\).\n\nApplying this to our case:\n   - \\( C \\lor P \\) (either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry)\n   - \\( \\neg P \\) (the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry)\n\nFrom these, we can infer \\( C \\) (the cookies are in the jar).\n\nAnswer: yes",
