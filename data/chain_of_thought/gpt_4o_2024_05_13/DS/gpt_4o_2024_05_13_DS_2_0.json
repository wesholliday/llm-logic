The first statement is: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     - Where \\( A \\) is \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n     - And \\( B \\) is \"The book is resting on the table.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book isn't resting on the table.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( A \\) (The book is on the shelf) can be inferred from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic:\n- From \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) is true) and \\( \\neg B \\) (not \\( B \\)), we can conclude that \\( A \\) must be true. This is because if \\( B \\) is false, the only way for \\( A \\lor B \\) to be true is if \\( A \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
