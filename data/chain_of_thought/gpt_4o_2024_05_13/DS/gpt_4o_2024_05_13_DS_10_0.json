The first statement is: \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The missing sock is in the laundry basket\" and \\( B \\) is \"The missing sock is under the bed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The missing sock isn't under the bed.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"The missing sock is not under the bed.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( A \\) (The missing sock is in the laundry basket) from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logical inference, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) is true) and \\( \\neg B \\) (not \\( B \\)), we can conclude \\( A \\) (the other part of the disjunction must be true).\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\lor B \\) (Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed)\n- \\( \\neg B \\) (The missing sock isn't under the bed)\n\nWe can infer:\n- \\( A \\) (The missing sock is in the laundry basket)\n\nAnswer: yes",
