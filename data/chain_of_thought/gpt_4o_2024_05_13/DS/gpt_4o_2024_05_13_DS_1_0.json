            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"Fido is inside\" from the given statements, let's break down the logical structure:\n\n1. The first statement is \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\" This can be represented in logical terms as:\n   \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Fido is inside\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Fido is in the garden.\"\n\n2. The second statement is \"Fido is not in the garden.\" This can be represented as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n   where \\( \\neg Q \\) means \"not Q\" or \"Fido is not in the garden.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( P \\) (Fido is inside) from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the rule of disjunction elimination (or the process of elimination) states that if we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), then \\( P \\) must be true. This is because if one of the two options in the disjunction is false, the other must be true for the disjunction to hold.\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n2. \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\nBy disjunction elimination:\n- Since \\( Q \\) is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), \\( P \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
