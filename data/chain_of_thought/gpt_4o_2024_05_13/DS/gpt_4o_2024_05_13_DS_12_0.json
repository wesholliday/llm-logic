The first statement is: \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\vee B \\), where \\( A \\) is \"The jacket is draped over the chair\" and \\( B \\) is \"The jacket is hanging in the closet.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( A \\) (The jacket is draped over the chair) can be inferred from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( A \\vee B \\) (either A or B is true) and \\( \\neg B \\) (B is not true), then \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet\" and \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet,\" we can infer that \"The jacket is draped over the chair.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
