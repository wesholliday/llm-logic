The first statement is a disjunction: \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand.\" This can be represented logically as:\n   \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The notebook is in the drawer\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The notebook is sitting on the nightstand.\"\n\n2. The second statement is a negation: \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\" This can be represented logically as:\n   \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if \\( P \\) (The notebook is in the drawer) can be inferred from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n4. According to the rules of logic, specifically the disjunctive syllogism, if we have a disjunction \\( P \\lor Q \\) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then the other disjunct must be true. Therefore, from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer \\( P \\).\n\nThus, based on the logical reasoning, we can infer that \"The notebook is in the drawer.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
