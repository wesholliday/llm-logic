The first statement is: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" and \\( B \\) is \"The watch is on his wrist.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The watch isn't on his wrist.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( A \\) (The watch is charging on the dresser) can be inferred from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either A or B is true) and \\( \\neg B \\) (B is not true), then \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( A \\lor B \\)\n- \\( \\neg B \\)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- \\( A \\)\n\nTherefore, from the statements \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist\" and \"The watch isn't on his wrist,\" we can infer \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
