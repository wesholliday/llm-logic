It tells us that the shoes are not lined up by the door.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the rules of logical inference:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n- From Statement 2, we know that the condition \"they are lined up by the door\" is false.\n\nSince the condition \"they are lined up by the door\" is false, the only remaining possibility from the disjunction in Statement 1 is that \"the shoes are in the closet\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: yes",
