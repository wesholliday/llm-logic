This statement specifies a single location where the bimboozle must be, which is 'snorkel quank'. There is no mention of 'flump quazzle' in the original statement.\n\nFor the inferred statement to be true, it would require additional information that the bimboozle must also be in 'flump quazzle'. However, the original statement does not provide any information about 'flump quazzle'. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the bimboozle must be in both 'snorkel quank' and 'flump quazzle' based solely on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
