The original statement is 'The froodle must be flump'.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The froodle must be flump and be glorp by frazzle'.\n\nThe original statement only tells us that the froodle must be flump. It does not provide any information about the froodle being glorp by frazzle. The additional condition 'be glorp by frazzle' is not mentioned or implied in the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement does not include any information about the froodle being glorp by frazzle, we cannot logically infer the additional condition from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
