The original statement is 'The zibble must be crunk'.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The zibble must be crunk and zump'.\n\nThe original statement only asserts that the zibble must be crunk. It does not provide any information about the zibble being zump. For the inference to be valid, the original statement would need to include information about both 'crunk' and 'zump'. Since it does not, we cannot logically infer that the zibble must be both crunk and zump from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
