The original statement is 'The grazzle must be zizz on crunk'.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The grazzle must be zizz on crunk and grazzle plonk fribble'.\n\nThe original statement provides information about the grazzle being zizz on crunk. The statement we want to infer adds an additional piece of information: 'grazzle plonk fribble'.\n\nFor an inference to be valid, the additional information must logically follow from the original statement. In this case, the original statement does not provide any information about 'grazzle plonk fribble'. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the additional information from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
