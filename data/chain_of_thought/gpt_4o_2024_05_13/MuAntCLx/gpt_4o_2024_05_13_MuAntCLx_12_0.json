The original statement is 'The grooble must be grazzle by grooble'.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The grooble must be grazzle by grooble and be wozzle flump'.\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the grooble being grazzle by grooble. It does not mention anything about being wozzle flump. Therefore, there is no basis in the original statement to infer the additional condition of being wozzle flump.\n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about the grooble being wozzle flump, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no",
