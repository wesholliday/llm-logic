The original statement is 'The zizz must be zibber flim wumble'.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The zizz must be zibber flim wumble and flimble a zibble'.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about 'flimble a zibble'. It only states that 'The zizz must be zibber flim wumble'. Adding 'and flimble a zibble' introduces new information that is not present in the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement does not mention anything about 'flimble a zibble', we cannot logically infer the additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
