The original statement is 'The gribble must be flimble'.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The gribble must be flimble and flump snorkel'.\n\nThe original statement asserts only one condition about the gribble: that it must be flimble. It does not provide any information about the gribble being flump snorkel. \n\nTo infer the second statement, we would need additional information that explicitly states or implies that the gribble must also be flump snorkel. Without such information, we cannot logically conclude that the gribble must be both flimble and flump snorkel based solely on the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
