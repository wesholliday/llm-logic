The original statement is 'The wobble must be wozzle'.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The wobble must be wozzle and wumble flim fribble'.\n\nThe original statement asserts that 'The wobble must be wozzle'. It does not provide any information about 'wumble flim fribble'. For the inference to be valid, the additional information ('wumble flim fribble') must logically follow from the original statement. However, there is no indication or logical connection in the original statement that suggests 'wumble flim fribble' is related to 'wozzle' or 'wobble'.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the additional information 'wumble flim fribble' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
