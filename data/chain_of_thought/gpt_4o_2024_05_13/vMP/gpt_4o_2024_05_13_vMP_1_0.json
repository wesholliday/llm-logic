            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Mary was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\).\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( M \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( S \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus ponens,\" which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and we know that \\( P \\) is true, then we can conclude that \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) (If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding)\n- \\( M \\) (Mary was at the wedding)\n- Therefore, \\( S \\) (Sue was at the wedding)\n\nSince the conclusion \\( S \\) logically follows from the premises using modus ponens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
