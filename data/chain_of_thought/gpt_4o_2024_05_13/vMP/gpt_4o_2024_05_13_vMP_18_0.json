            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) represents \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The doll was plastic.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( P \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( Q \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus ponens,\" which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus ponens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( P \\) are both true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
