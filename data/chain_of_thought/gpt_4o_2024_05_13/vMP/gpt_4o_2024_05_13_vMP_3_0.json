The first premise is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"The book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The book was written by James.\" This can be represented as: \\( P \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The book is a mystery novel.\" This can be represented as: \\( Q \\).\n\nThe argument can be structured as follows:\n- Premise 1: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( P \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( Q \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus ponens,\" which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus ponens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( P \\) are both true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
