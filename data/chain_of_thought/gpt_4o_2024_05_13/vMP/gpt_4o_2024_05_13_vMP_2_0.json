            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( G \\rightarrow U \\), where \\( G \\) represents \"the griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The griffin was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( G \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( U \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( G \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( U \\)\n\nThis form of argument is a classic example of Modus Ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus Ponens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if P then Q) and \\( P \\) (P is true), then \\( Q \\) (Q must be true).\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( P \\) is \\( G \\) (the griffin was in the forest)\n- \\( Q \\) is \\( U \\) (the unicorn was in the forest)\n\nSince both premises are true, the conclusion \\( U \\) logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes",
