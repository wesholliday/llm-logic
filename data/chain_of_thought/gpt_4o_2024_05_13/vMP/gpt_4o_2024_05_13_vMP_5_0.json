            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\), where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Jeff played basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\).\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( J \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( A \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus ponens,\" which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus ponens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\)) and \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( P \\) is \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball)\n- \\( Q \\) is \\( A \\) (Amy played tennis)\n\nSince both premises are true (\\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and \\( J \\)), the conclusion (\\( A \\)) logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes",
