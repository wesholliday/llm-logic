            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\), where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Tom watched football.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Jen watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\).\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( T \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( J \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus ponens,\" which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and the antecedent \\( P \\) is true, then the consequent \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball)\n- \\( T \\) (Tom watched football)\n- Therefore, \\( J \\) (Jen watched basketball)\n\nSince the conclusion \\( J \\) logically follows from the premises using modus ponens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
