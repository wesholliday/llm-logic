            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\rightarrow C \\), where \\( D \\) represents \"the dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The dog was inside.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The cat was outside.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\).\n\nNow, let's put the premises and the conclusion together:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( D \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( C \\)\n\nThis argument follows the form of Modus Ponens, which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus Ponens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\)) and \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true.\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( P \\) is \\( D \\) (the dog was inside)\n- \\( Q \\) is \\( C \\) (the cat was outside)\n\nSince both premises are true (\\( D \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( D \\)), the conclusion (\\( C \\)) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
