            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze its structure and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), where \\( A \\) represents \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The apple was red.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\).\n\nThe argument can be summarized as:\n- Premise 1: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( A \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( B \\)\n\nThis form of argument is known as \"modus ponens,\" which is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. Modus ponens states that if \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( A \\) are both true, then \\( B \\) must also be true.\n\nSince the argument follows the modus ponens structure, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
