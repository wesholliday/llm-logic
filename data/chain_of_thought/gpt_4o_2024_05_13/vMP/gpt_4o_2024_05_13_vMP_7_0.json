The first premise is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Alex finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Chris finished the race.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\).\n\nNow, let's analyze the argument step by step:\n\n- From the first premise \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), we know that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must also be true.\n- The second premise \\( A \\) states that Alex finished the race, which means \\( A \\) is true.\n- Given that \\( A \\) is true and \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is true, we can conclude that \\( C \\) must be true.\n\nSince the conclusion \\( C \\) logically follows from the premises \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( A \\), the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
