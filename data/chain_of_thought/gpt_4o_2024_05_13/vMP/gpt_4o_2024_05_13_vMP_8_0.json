            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\" and \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The vampire was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The mummy was awake.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\).\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( V \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( M \\)\n\nThis is a classic example of the modus ponens form of argument, which is structured as follows:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If P then Q)\n- \\( P \\) (P is true)\n- Therefore, \\( Q \\) (Q must be true)\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( P \\) is \\( V \\) (the vampire was awake)\n- \\( Q \\) is \\( M \\) (the mummy was awake)\n\nSince the premises \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( V \\) are both given, the conclusion \\( M \\) logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes",
