            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\), where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( L \\).\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\).\n\nNow, let's examine the logical structure:\n\n- Premise 1: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n- Premise 2: \\( L \\)\n- Conclusion: \\( M \\)\n\nThis is a classic example of the logical form known as \"modus ponens,\" which can be summarized as follows:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (If P then Q)\n- \\( P \\) (P is true)\n- Therefore, \\( Q \\) (Q must be true)\n\nIn this case:\n- \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt)\n- \\( L \\) (Lisa bought the red shirt)\n- Therefore, \\( M \\) (Mark bought the blue shirt)\n\nSince the conclusion \\( M \\) logically follows from the premises \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( L \\) using modus ponens, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
