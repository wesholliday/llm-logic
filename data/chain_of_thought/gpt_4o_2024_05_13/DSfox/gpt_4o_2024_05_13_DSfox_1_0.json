The first statement is: \"The flugel is not zargled.\"\n   - This means that the flugel is definitely not in the state of being zargled.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the flugel is zargled or it is blimmed.\"\n   - This is a disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the flugel is zargled, or the flugel is blimmed, or both.\n\nGiven the first statement, we know that the flugel is not zargled. This eliminates the possibility that the flugel is zargled.\n\nSince the second statement requires that at least one of the conditions must be true and we have already ruled out the possibility that the flugel is zargled, the only remaining possibility is that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the flugel is blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
