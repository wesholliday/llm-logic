The first statement is: \"The smip is not lupped.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acL (where L represents \"the smip is lupped\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped.\"\n   - This can be written as: L \u2228 S (where S represents \"the smip is shripped\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer S (the smip is shripped) from these two statements.\n\n3. From the first statement, we have \u00acL (the smip is not lupped).\n\n4. The second statement is a disjunction: L \u2228 S (either the smip is lupped or it is shripped).\n\nIn logic, a disjunction (L \u2228 S) is true if at least one of the components (L or S) is true. Given that \u00acL (the smip is not lupped), L is false. For the disjunction L \u2228 S to be true when L is false, S must be true.\n\nTherefore, from \u00acL and L \u2228 S, we can infer that S is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
