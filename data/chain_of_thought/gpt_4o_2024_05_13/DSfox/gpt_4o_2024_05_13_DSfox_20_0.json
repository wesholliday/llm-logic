The first statement is: \"The fleeg is not surned.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acS (where S represents \"the fleeg is surned\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered.\"\n   - This can be written as: S \u2228 B (where B represents \"the fleeg is bluttered\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer B (the fleeg is bluttered) from \u00acS and S \u2228 B.\n\n3. From \u00acS, we know that S is false.\n   - Therefore, S \u2228 B simplifies to false \u2228 B.\n\n4. In logic, false \u2228 B is equivalent to B.\n   - Since S is false, the disjunction S \u2228 B must rely on B being true for the statement to hold.\n\nTherefore, given that S is false and S \u2228 B must be true, B must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
