The first statement is: \"The splat is not quanked.\"\n   - This means that the splat is definitely not in the state of being quanked.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the splat is quanked, or the splat is morphed.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the process of elimination:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the splat is not quanked.\n- Since the splat is not quanked, the first part of the disjunction in the second statement (\"the splat is quanked\") is false.\n- For the disjunction to be true, at least one of the conditions must be true. Since \"the splat is quanked\" is false, the only way for the disjunction to hold true is if \"the splat is morphed\" is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
