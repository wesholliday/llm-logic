The first statement is: \"The smonk is not plagged.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acP (where P stands for \"the smonk is plagged\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled.\"\n   - This can be written as: P \u2228 V (where V stands for \"the smonk is vreebled\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer V (the smonk is vreebled) from \u00acP and P \u2228 V.\n\n3. From the first statement, we have \u00acP (the smonk is not plagged).\n\n4. From the second statement, we have P \u2228 V (either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled).\n\nIn logic, if we have a disjunction (P \u2228 V) and we know that one of the disjuncts (P) is false (\u00acP), then the other disjunct (V) must be true. This is because for a disjunction to be true, at least one of the disjuncts must be true.\n\nSince we know \u00acP (the smonk is not plagged), and we have P \u2228 V (either the smonk is plagged or it is vreebled), it follows that V must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
