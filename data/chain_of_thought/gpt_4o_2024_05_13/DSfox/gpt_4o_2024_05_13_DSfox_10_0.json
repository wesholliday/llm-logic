The first statement is: \"The wug is not garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \u00acG (where G represents \"the wug is garpled\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: G \u2228 S (where S represents \"the wug is sproinged\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer S (the wug is sproinged) from \u00acG and G \u2228 S.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism, if we have a disjunction (G \u2228 S) and we know that one of the disjuncts is false (\u00acG), then the other disjunct must be true.\n\n4. Applying this rule:\n   - We have \u00acG (the wug is not garpled).\n   - We also have G \u2228 S (either the wug is garpled or it is sproinged).\n\nSince \u00acG is true, G must be false. Therefore, for the disjunction G \u2228 S to hold true, S must be true.\n\nThus, we can infer that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
