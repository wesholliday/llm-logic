The first statement is: \"The grommet is not plopped.\"\n   - This means that the grommet is definitely not in the state of being plopped.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: the grommet is either plopped or sploffed.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the process of elimination:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the grommet is not plopped.\n- The second statement tells us that if the grommet is not plopped, then it must be sploffed (since one of the two conditions must hold true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
