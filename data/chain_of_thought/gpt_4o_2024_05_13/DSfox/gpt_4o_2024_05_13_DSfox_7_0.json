The first statement is: \"The whiffle is not tinked.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acT (where T represents \"the whiffle is tinked\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the whiffle is tinked or it is shanked.\"\n   - This can be written as: T \u2228 S (where S represents \"the whiffle is shanked\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer S (the whiffle is shanked) from \u00acT and T \u2228 S.\n\n3. From the first statement, we know \u00acT is true.\n   - This means T is false.\n\n4. Given the second statement (T \u2228 S), and knowing that T is false, we can substitute \u00acT into the second statement:\n   - Since T is false, the only way for T \u2228 S to be true is if S is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis, we can infer that S (the whiffle is shanked) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
