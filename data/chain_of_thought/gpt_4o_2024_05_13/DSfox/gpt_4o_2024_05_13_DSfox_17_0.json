The first statement is: \"The flob is not movated.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acM (where M stands for \"movated\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the flob is movated or it is skizzled.\"\n   - This can be written as: M \u2228 S (where S stands for \"skizzled\").\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer S (the flob is skizzled) from \u00acM and M \u2228 S.\n\n3. We know from the first statement that \u00acM is true.\n   - This means M is false.\n\n4. Given the second statement (M \u2228 S), we know that at least one of M or S must be true.\n   - Since M is false (from \u00acM), the only way for M \u2228 S to be true is if S is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that S (the flob is skizzled) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
