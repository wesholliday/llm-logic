The first statement is: \"The fribble is not crinked.\"\n   - This means that the fribble is definitely not in a crinked state.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the fribble is crinked or it is snurgled.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the fribble is crinked, or the fribble is snurgled.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the process of elimination:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the fribble is not crinked.\n- Since the fribble is not crinked, the first part of the disjunction in the second statement (\"the fribble is crinked\") is false.\n- For the disjunction to be true, at least one part must be true. Since \"the fribble is crinked\" is false, the other part (\"the fribble is snurgled\") must be true to satisfy the disjunction.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
