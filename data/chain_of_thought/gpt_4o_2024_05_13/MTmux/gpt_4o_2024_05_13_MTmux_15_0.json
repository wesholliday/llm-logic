The first statement is: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( V \\) represents \"the dreb was vroombed\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the dreb must have been spened.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the dreb was not spened.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg V \\) (the dreb was not vroombed) from \\( V \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( V \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg V \\).\n   - The contrapositive of \\( V \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\).\n   - Since we have \\( \\neg S \\), we can apply the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg V \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
