The first statement is: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\text{Fleeked} \\rightarrow \\text{Snugged} \\).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg \\text{Snugged} \\).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg \\text{Fleeked} \\) (the clug was not fleeked) from these statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we have:\n- \\( \\text{Fleeked} \\rightarrow \\text{Snugged} \\)\n- \\( \\neg \\text{Snugged} \\)\n\nFrom the contrapositive of the first statement, we know:\n- \\( \\neg \\text{Snugged} \\rightarrow \\neg \\text{Fleeked} \\)\n\nGiven \\( \\neg \\text{Snugged} \\) from the second statement, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- Since \\( \\neg \\text{Snugged} \\) is true, \\( \\neg \\text{Fleeked} \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
