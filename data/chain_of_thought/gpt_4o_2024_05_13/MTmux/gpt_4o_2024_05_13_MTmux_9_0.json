The first statement is: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow V \\)\n     where \\( P \\) represents \"the twonk was plinked\" and \\( V \\) represents \"the twonk was varnished.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg V \\)\n     where \\( \\neg V \\) represents \"the twonk was not varnished.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (the twonk was not plinked) from \\( P \\rightarrow V \\) and \\( \\neg V \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( P \\rightarrow V \\) and \\( \\neg V \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n   - The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow V \\) is \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n   - Since we have \\( \\neg V \\), we can apply the contrapositive to conclude \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
