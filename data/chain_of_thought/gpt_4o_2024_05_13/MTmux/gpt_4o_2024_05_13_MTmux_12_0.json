The first statement is: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip must have lupped the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow L \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents \"the smip was shripped\" and \\( L \\) represents \"the smip must have lupped the zoint.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the smip must have lupped the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg L \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg S \\) (the smip was not shripped) from these statements.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( S \\rightarrow L \\) and \\( \\neg L \\), we can use Modus Tollens to infer \\( \\neg S \\).\n\n   - Modus Tollens states that if \\( S \\rightarrow L \\) and \\( \\neg L \\) are true, then \\( \\neg S \\) must also be true.\n\nSince both conditions for Modus Tollens are satisfied, we can infer \\( \\neg S \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
