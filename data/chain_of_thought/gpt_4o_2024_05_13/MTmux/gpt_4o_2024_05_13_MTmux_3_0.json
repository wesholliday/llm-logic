The first statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( M \\) represents \"the splat was morphed\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the splat must have quanked.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n     where \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"the splat must not have quanked.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg M \\) (the splat was not morphed) from \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg M \\).\n   - The contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\n4. Given \\( \\neg Q \\) (the splat must not have quanked), and using the contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), we can infer \\( \\neg M \\) (the splat was not morphed).\n\nTherefore, based on the logical analysis, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
