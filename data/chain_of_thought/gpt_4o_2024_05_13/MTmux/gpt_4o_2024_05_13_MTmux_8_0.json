The first statement is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow D \\)\n     - Where \\( C \\) represents \"the sprocket was cranked\"\n     - And \\( D \\) represents \"the sprocket must have been daggled\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg D \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg D \\) represents \"the sprocket must not have been daggled\"\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer: \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From the first statement \\( C \\rightarrow D \\), we know that if \\( C \\) is true, then \\( D \\) must also be true.\n- From the second statement \\( \\neg D \\), we know that \\( D \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) and \\( \\neg D \\), we can use the contrapositive of the implication:\n- The contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) is \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n- Since \\( \\neg D \\) is true (from the second statement), it follows that \\( \\neg C \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
