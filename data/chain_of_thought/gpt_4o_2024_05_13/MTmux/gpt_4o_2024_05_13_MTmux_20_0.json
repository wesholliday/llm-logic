The first statement is: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the fleeg was surned.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the fleeg was not surned.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg B \\) (the fleeg was not bluttered) from \\( B \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( B \\rightarrow S \\) and \\( \\neg S \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg B \\).\n   - The contrapositive of \\( B \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n   - Since we have \\( \\neg S \\), we can apply the contrapositive to conclude \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
