The first statement is: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank must have been nugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow N \\)\n     where \\( P \\) represents \"the shank was plooked\" and \\( N \\) represents \"the shank must have been nugged.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the shank must have been nugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg N \\)\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (the shank was not plooked) from \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) and \\( \\neg N \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) and \\( \\neg N \\), we can use Modus Tollens to infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n   - Modus Tollens states that if \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) and \\( \\neg N \\) are true, then \\( \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nSince both \\( P \\rightarrow N \\) and \\( \\neg N \\) are given, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
