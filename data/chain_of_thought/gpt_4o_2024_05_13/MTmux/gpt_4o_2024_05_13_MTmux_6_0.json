The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( S \\rightarrow P \\)\n- \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nFrom the contrapositive, we have:\n- \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\nSince we know \\( \\neg P \\) is true, we can apply the contrapositive:\n- \\( \\neg P \\) is true\n- Therefore, \\( \\neg S \\) must be true\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
