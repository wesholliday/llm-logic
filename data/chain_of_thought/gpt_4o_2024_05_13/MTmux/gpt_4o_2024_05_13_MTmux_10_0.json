The first statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow G \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the wug was sproinged\" and \\( G \\) represents \"the wug must have been garpled.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg G \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg G \\) represents \"it is not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg S \\) (the wug was not sproinged) from \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) and \\( \\neg G \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically modus tollens:\n   - If \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) (if S then G) and \\( \\neg G \\) (not G) are both true, then we can infer \\( \\neg S \\) (not S).\n\n4. Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - We have \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) (if the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled).\n   - We also have \\( \\neg G \\) (it is not the case that the wug must have been garpled).\n\nTherefore, from \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) and \\( \\neg G \\), we can infer \\( \\neg S \\) (the wug was not sproinged).\n\nAnswer: yes",
