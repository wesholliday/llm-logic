The first statement is: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug must have been zimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\)\n     where \\( B \\) represents \"the flug was blummed\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"the flug was zimmed.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the flug must have been zimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Z \\)\n     where \\( \\neg Z \\) represents \"the flug was not zimmed.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg B \\) (the flug was not blummed) from \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\) and \\( \\neg Z \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\) and \\( \\neg Z \\), we can use modus tollens to infer \\( \\neg B \\).\n   - Modus tollens states that if \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\) and \\( \\neg Z \\) are true, then \\( \\neg B \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we can infer that the flug was not blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
