It does not provide any information about other services or amenities, such as the provision of fresh towels. While it is possible that a room cleaned daily might also receive fresh towels, this is not explicitly stated or implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer with certainty that fresh towels were provided daily based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no",
