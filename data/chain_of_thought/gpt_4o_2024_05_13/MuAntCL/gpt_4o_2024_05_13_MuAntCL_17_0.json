The original statement is 'The report must have been accurate'.\n2. This statement asserts that the accuracy of the report is certain or highly likely.\n3. The additional information in the inferred statement is 'and been submitted by noon'.\n4. There is no information in the original statement about the submission time of the report.\n5. Therefore, the original statement does not provide any basis to infer the submission time of the report.\n\nSince the original statement only addresses the accuracy of the report and does not mention anything about the submission time, we cannot logically infer that the report was submitted by noon.\n\nAnswer: no",
