However, it does not provide any information about whether the software was restarted after the update. While it is common for software to require a restart after an update, this is not always the case. Some updates may not require a restart, or the restart may not have been performed yet. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer from the given statement that the software was both updated and restarted.\n\nAnswer: no",
