            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been signed and notarized' from 'The document must have been signed', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.\n\n1. The original statement, 'The document must have been signed', indicates that the document has a signature on it. This is a necessary condition for the document.\n2. The inferred statement, 'The document must have been signed and notarized', adds an additional condition that the document must also have been notarized, which means it has been authenticated by a notary public.\n\nThe original statement only specifies that the document must have been signed. It does not provide any information about notarization. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the document must have been notarized based solely on the information that it must have been signed.\n\nAnswer: no",
