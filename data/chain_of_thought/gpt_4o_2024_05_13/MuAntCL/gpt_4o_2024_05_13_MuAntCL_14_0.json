The original statement, 'The contract must have been valid for a year', tells us that the contract had a validity period of one year.\n2. The inferred statement, 'The contract must have been valid for a year and been renewable', adds an additional condition that the contract was renewable.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about the renewability of the contract. It only specifies the duration of validity. Therefore, we cannot infer the additional condition of renewability from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
