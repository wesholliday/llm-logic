The original statement is: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - This means: If V (the smonk was vreebled) is true, then \\( \\neg P \\) (the smonk did not plagged) is true.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n   - This means: If P (the smonk plagged) is true, then \\( \\neg V \\) (the smonk was not vreebled) is true.\n\nTo see if this inference is valid, we can use the contrapositive method. The contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg P) \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg P) \\) gives us \\( P \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) from \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
