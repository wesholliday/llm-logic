            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled' from 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents 'the flob was skizzled' and \\( \\neg M \\) represents 'the flob did not movated'.\n\n2. We need to determine if 'If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled' can be inferred.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( M \\) represents 'the flob movated' and \\( \\neg S \\) represents 'the flob was not skizzled'.\n\n3. The logical relationship we are looking for is the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is \\( \\neg (\\neg M) \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), which simplifies to \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\n5. Therefore, 'If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled' is indeed the contrapositive of 'If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
