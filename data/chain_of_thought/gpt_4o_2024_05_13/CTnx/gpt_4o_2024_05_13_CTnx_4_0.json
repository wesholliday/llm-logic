The original statement is: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the fribble was snurgled\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the fribble did not crink.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\nTo see if \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), we can use the concept of the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is \\( \\neg (\\neg C) \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), which simplifies to \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
