The original statement is: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg Z \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the flugel was blimmed\" and \\( \\neg Z \\) represents \"the flugel was not zargled.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( Z \\) represents \"the flugel was zargled\" and \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nTo see if \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg Z \\) implies \\( Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg Z \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg Z) \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg Z) \\) gives \\( Z \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly what we are trying to infer, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
