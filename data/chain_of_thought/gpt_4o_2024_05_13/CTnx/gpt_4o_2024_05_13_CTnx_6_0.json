The original statement is: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents \"the grommet was sploffed\" and \\( P \\) represents \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\nTo see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is \\( \\neg (\\neg P) \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), which simplifies to \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
