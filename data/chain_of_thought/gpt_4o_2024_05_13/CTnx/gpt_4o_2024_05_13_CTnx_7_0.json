The original statement is: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the whiffle was shanked\"\n     - And \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"the whiffle did not tink\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the whiffle tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n     - Where \\( T \\) represents \"the whiffle tink\"\n     - And \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the whiffle was not shanked\"\n\n3. To see if \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\), we need to understand the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
