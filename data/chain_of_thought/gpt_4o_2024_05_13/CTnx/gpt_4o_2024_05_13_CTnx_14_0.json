The original statement is: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n     - Where \\( F \\) represents \"the clug was fleeked\"\n     - And \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the clug did not snugged\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the clug snugged\"\n     - And \\( \\neg F \\) represents \"the clug was not fleeked\"\n\n3. To see if \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\) can be inferred from \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), we need to understand the contrapositive of the original statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\)\n     - This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) is \\( \\neg q \\rightarrow \\neg p \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n4. Therefore, the contrapositive of \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged\" is \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nSince the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" from \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
