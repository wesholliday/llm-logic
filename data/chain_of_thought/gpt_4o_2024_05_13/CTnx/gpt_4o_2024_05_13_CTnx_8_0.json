The original statement is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) represents \"the sprocket was cranked\" and \\( \\neg D \\) represents \"the sprocket was not daggled.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   - Where \\( D \\) represents \"the sprocket was daggled\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\n3. To see if \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\), we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) is \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n   - In logic, a statement is always equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nSince \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is the contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\), and a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can indeed infer \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) from \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
