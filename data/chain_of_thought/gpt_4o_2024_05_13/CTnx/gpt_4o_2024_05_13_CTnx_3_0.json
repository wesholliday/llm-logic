The original statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n     - Where \\( M \\) represents \"the splat was morphed\"\n     - And \\( \\neg Q \\) represents \"the splat did not quank\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n     - Where \\( Q \\) represents \"the splat quank\"\n     - And \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"the splat was not morphed\"\n\nTo see if \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) can be inferred from \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg Q) \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg Q) \\) gives us \\( Q \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) from \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
