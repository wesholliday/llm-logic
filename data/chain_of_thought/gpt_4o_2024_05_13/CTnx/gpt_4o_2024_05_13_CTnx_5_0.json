The original statement is: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( F \\) represents \"the zinger was fraggled\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the zinger was smoogled\" and \\( \\neg F \\) represents \"the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\n3. To see if \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) implies \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\), we can use the contrapositive.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\) is the contrapositive of \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), and the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\) from \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
