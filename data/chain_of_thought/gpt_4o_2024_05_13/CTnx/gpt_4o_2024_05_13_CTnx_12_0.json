The original statement is: 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg L \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents 'the smip was shripped' and \\( \\neg L \\) represents 'the smip did not lup the zoint'.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: 'If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( L \\) represents 'the smip lupped the zoint' and \\( \\neg S \\) represents 'the smip was not shripped'.\n\n3. To see if \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg L \\), we need to understand the contrapositive of the original statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) is \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, if \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) is true, then \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) must also be true.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer 'If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped' from 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
