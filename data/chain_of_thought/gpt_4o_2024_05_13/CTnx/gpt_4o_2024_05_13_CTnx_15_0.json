The original statement is: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n     - Where \\( V \\) represents \"the dreb was vroombed\"\n     - And \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the dreb was not spened\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the dreb was spened\"\n     - And \\( \\neg V \\) represents \"the dreb was not vroombed\"\n\n3. To check if \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) can be inferred from \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n     - This is because the contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n4. Therefore, the contrapositive of \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" (i.e., \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)) is \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" (i.e., \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the desired statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
