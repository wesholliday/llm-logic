The original statement is: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg N \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the shank was plooked\" and \\( \\neg N \\) represents \"the shank was not nugged.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( N \\) represents \"the shank was nugged\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nTo see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg N \\) implies \\( N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg N \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg N) \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg N) \\) gives us \\( N \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is \\( N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly what we are trying to infer, and since a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can indeed infer 'If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked' from 'If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
