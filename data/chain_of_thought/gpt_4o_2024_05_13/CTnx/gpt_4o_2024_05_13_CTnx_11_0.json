The original statement is: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg Z \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the flug was blummed\" and \\( \\neg Z \\) represents \"the flug was not zimmed.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( Z \\) represents \"the flug was zimmed\" and \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the flug was not blummed.\"\n\nTo see if \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg Z \\) implies \\( Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg Z \\) is \\( Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly what we are trying to infer, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
