The original statement is: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n     - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the fleeg was bluttered\"\n     - And \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"it did not surn\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the fleeg surned\"\n     - And \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the fleeg was not bluttered\"\n\n3. To see if \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) can be inferred from \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), we need to understand the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Therefore, \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is logically equivalent to \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly what we are trying to infer, we can indeed infer 'If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered' from 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
