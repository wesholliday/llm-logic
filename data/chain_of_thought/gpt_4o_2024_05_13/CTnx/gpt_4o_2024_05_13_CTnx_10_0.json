The original statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg G \\)\n   - This means: If \\( S \\) (the wug was sproinged) is true, then \\( \\neg G \\) (the wug was not garpled) is true.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - This means: If \\( G \\) (the wug was garpled) is true, then \\( \\neg S \\) (the wug was not sproinged) is true.\n\nTo see if this inference is valid, we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and both statements are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg G \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg G) \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg G) \\) gives \\( G \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer that 'If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged' from 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
