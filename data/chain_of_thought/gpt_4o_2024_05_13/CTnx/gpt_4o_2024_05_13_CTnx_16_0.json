The original statement is: 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg did not sproted the frink.'\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n     where \\( C \\) represents 'the sneg was crampled' and \\( \\neg S \\) represents 'the sneg did not sproted the frink'.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: 'If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled.'\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents 'the sneg sproted the frink' and \\( \\neg C \\) represents 'the sneg was not crampled'.\n\n3. To check if \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), we use the contrapositive rule in logic.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is the contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) from \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
