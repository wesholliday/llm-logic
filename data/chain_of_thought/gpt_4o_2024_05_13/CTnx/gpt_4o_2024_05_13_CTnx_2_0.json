The original statement is: 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( F \\) represents 'the wug was flooped' and \\( \\neg B \\) represents 'the wug did not bim the zoint'.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: 'If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg F \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents 'the wug bimmed the zoint' and \\( \\neg F \\) represents 'the wug was not flooped'.\n\n3. To check if \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) implies \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg F \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg F \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, since \\( B \\rightarrow \\neg F \\) is the contrapositive of \\( F \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), we can infer 'If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped' from 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
