The original statement is: 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents 'the glip was slogged' and \\( T \\) represents 'the glip was tragged'.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: 'If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\n3. To see if \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\), we need to understand the logical relationship between these statements.\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\). The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. Therefore, \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is logically equivalent to \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer 'If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged' from 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
