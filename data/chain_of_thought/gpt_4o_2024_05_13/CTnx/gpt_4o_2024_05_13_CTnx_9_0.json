The original statement is: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the twonk was plinked\" and \\( \\neg V \\) represents \"the twonk was not varnished.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( V \\) represents \"the twonk was varnished\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the twonk was not plinked.\"\n\n3. To see if \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) can be inferred from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\), we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) is \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n   - In logic, a statement is always equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nSince \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\), and a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can indeed infer \\( V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
