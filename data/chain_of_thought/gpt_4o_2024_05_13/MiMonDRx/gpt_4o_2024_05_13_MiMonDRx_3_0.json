The original statement is 'The wozzle might be in the grooble'. This means there is a possibility that the wozzle is in the grooble.\n2. The inferred statement is 'The wozzle might be in the quazzle or in the grooble'. This means there is a possibility that the wozzle is in either the quazzle or the grooble.\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the possibility of the wozzle being in the grooble. It does not provide any information about the quazzle. Therefore, we cannot infer anything about the wozzle being in the quazzle from the original statement alone.\n\nSince the original statement does not mention the quazzle at all, we cannot logically infer that the wozzle might be in the quazzle.\n\nAnswer: no",
