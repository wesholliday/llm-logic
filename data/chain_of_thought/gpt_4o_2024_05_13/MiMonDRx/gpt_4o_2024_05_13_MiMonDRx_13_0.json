The original statement is 'The snork might be zump'. This means there is a possibility that 'The snork' is 'zump'.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The snork might be blimple or zump'. This means there is a possibility that 'The snork' is either 'blimple' or 'zump'.\n\nThe key point here is that the original statement only provides information about the possibility of 'The snork' being 'zump'. It does not provide any information about 'The snork' being 'blimple'. \n\nSince the original statement does not mention 'blimple' at all, we cannot logically infer that 'The snork might be blimple or zump' based solely on the information given in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
