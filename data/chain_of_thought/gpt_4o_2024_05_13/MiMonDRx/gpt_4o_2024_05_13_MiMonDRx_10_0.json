The original statement 'The blimple might be quimble' suggests that there is a possibility that the blimple is quimble. It does not provide any information about other possibilities or what else the blimple might be.\n\n2. The inferred statement 'The blimple might be blimp or quimble' suggests that there is a possibility that the blimple is either blimp or quimble. This introduces an additional possibility (blimp) that is not mentioned in the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement only mentions the possibility of the blimple being quimble and does not mention anything about it being blimp, we cannot logically infer the additional possibility of it being blimp from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
