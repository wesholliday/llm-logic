The original statement is 'The frazzle might be snork'. This means that there is a possibility that the frazzle is snork.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The frazzle might be quork or snork'. This means that there is a possibility that the frazzle is either quork or snork.\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the possibility of the frazzle being snork. It does not provide any information about the possibility of the frazzle being quork. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the frazzle might be quork or snork based solely on the information given in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
