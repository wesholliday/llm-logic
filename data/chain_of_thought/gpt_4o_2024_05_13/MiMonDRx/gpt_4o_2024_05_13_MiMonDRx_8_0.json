The original statement is 'The quank might be quorple'. This means that there is a possibility that the quank is quorple.\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'The quank might be wozzle or quorple'. This means that there is a possibility that the quank is either wozzle or quorple.\n\nThe key point here is that the original statement only provides information about the possibility of the quank being quorple. It does not provide any information about the possibility of the quank being wozzle. Therefore, we cannot infer the possibility of the quank being wozzle from the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement does not mention wozzle at all, we cannot logically extend the possibility to include wozzle without additional information.\n\nAnswer: no",
