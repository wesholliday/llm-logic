            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"Fido is inside\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Fido is in the garden.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"Fido is not in the garden.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"Fido is inside.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The first premise \\( P \\lor Q \\) states that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg Q \\) states that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer that \\( P \\) must be true. This is because if \\( Q \\) is false and \\( P \\lor Q \\) is true, the only way for \\( P \\lor Q \\) to be true is if \\( P \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
