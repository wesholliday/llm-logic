The first premise is: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"The toy is in the toy box\" and \\( B \\) is \"The toy is sitting on the shelf.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( A \\lor B \\), we know that at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg B \\), we know that \\( B \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( B \\) is false, the only way for the first premise \\( A \\lor B \\) to be true is if \\( A \\) is true. Therefore, \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nSince \\( A \\) represents \"The toy is in the toy box,\" the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
