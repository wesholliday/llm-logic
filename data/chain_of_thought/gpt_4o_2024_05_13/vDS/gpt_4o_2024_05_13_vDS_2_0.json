            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the structure of the argument and see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n1. The first premise is: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"The book is on the shelf\" and \\( B \\) is \"The book is resting on the table.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The book isn't resting on the table.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The first premise \\( A \\lor B \\) states that at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg B \\) states that \\( B \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\), we can infer that \\( A \\) must be true. This is because if \\( B \\) is false, the only way for \\( A \\lor B \\) to be true is if \\( A \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( A \\) logically follows from the premises \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
