The first premise is: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( C \\lor P \\)\n     where \\( C \\) stands for \"The cookies are in the jar\" and \\( P \\) stands for \"The cookies are hidden in the pantry.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( C \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( C \\lor P \\), we know that at least one of \\( C \\) or \\( P \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg P \\), we know that \\( P \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( P \\) is false, the only way for the first premise \\( C \\lor P \\) to be true is if \\( C \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( C \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
