The first premise is: \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it is on his wrist.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) is \"The watch is charging on the dresser\" and \\( B \\) is \"The watch is on his wrist.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The watch isn't on his wrist.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( A \\lor B \\), we know that at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg B \\) tells us that \\( B \\) is false.\n- If \\( B \\) is false, then for the disjunction \\( A \\lor B \\) to be true, \\( A \\) must be true.\n\nTherefore, given the premises, the conclusion \\( A \\) logically follows.\n\nAnswer: yes",
