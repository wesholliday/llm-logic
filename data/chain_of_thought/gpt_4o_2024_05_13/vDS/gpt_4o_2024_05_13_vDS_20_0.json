The first premise is: \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\"\n   - This can be symbolized as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"The sunglasses are in her bag\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The sunglasses are perched on her head.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\"\n   - This can be symbolized as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The sunglasses are in her bag.\"\n   - This can be symbolized as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The first premise \\( P \\lor Q \\) states that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg Q \\) states that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can deduce \\( P \\). This is because if \\( Q \\) is false, the only way for \\( P \\lor Q \\) to be true is if \\( P \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
