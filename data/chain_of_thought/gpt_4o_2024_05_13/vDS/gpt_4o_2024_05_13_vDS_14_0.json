The first premise is: \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"The milk is on the counter\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The milk is chilling in the fridge.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The first premise \\( P \\lor Q \\) states that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg Q \\) states that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), we can infer that \\( P \\) must be true because if \\( Q \\) is false, the only way for \\( P \\lor Q \\) to be true is if \\( P \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( P \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
