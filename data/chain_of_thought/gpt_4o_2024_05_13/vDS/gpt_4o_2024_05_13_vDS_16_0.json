The first premise is: \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"The pen is in my bag\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The pen is on my desk.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The pen isn't on my desk.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, let's see if the conclusion \\( P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\n- From the first premise \\( P \\lor Q \\), we know that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg Q \\), we know that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nSince \\( Q \\) is false, the only way for the first premise \\( P \\lor Q \\) to be true is if \\( P \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( P \\) logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: yes",
