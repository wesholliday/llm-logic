The first premise is: \"Either the umbrella is in the car or it is tucked away in the closet.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( U \\lor C \\)\n     where \\( U \\) stands for \"The umbrella is in the car\" and \\( C \\) stands for \"The umbrella is tucked away in the closet.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg C \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( U \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- The first premise \\( U \\lor C \\) states that at least one of \\( U \\) or \\( C \\) must be true.\n- The second premise \\( \\neg C \\) states that \\( C \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg C \\) (the umbrella is not in the closet), the only remaining possibility from the first premise \\( U \\lor C \\) is that \\( U \\) must be true (the umbrella is in the car).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \\( U \\) logically follows from the premises \\( U \\lor C \\) and \\( \\neg C \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
