The first premise is: \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"The remote control is on the coffee table\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The remote control is hiding under the couch.\"\n\n2. The second premise is: \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg Q \\)\n\n3. The conclusion is: \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\)\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical structure:\n\n- From the first premise \\( P \\lor Q \\), we know that at least one of \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) must be true.\n- From the second premise \\( \\neg Q \\), we know that \\( Q \\) is false.\n\nGiven that \\( Q \\) is false, the only way for the first premise \\( P \\lor Q \\) to be true is if \\( P \\) is true. Therefore, \\( P \\) must be true.\n\nSince the conclusion \\( P \\) logically follows from the premises \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg Q \\), the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
