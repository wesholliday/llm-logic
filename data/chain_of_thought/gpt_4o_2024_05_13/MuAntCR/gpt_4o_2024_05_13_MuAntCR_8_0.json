The original statement is: 'The restaurant must have served Italian cuisine.'\n2. The inferred statement is: 'The restaurant must have been closed on Monday and served Italian cuisine.'\n\nThe original statement only provides information about the type of cuisine the restaurant served. It does not provide any information about the restaurant's operating hours or days of operation. Therefore, there is no basis to infer that the restaurant was closed on Monday from the given information.\n\nSince the inferred statement introduces new information (the restaurant being closed on Monday) that is not supported by the original statement, we cannot logically infer the inferred statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
