The original statement is 'The movie must have had subtitles'. This indicates that the movie had subtitles, but it does not specify the language of the movie.\n2. The inference 'The movie must have been in English and had subtitles' adds an additional detail that the movie was in English.\n3. There is no information in the original statement about the language of the movie. It could have been in any language, not necessarily English.\n\nSince the original statement does not provide any information about the language of the movie, we cannot logically infer that the movie was in English.\n\nAnswer: no",
