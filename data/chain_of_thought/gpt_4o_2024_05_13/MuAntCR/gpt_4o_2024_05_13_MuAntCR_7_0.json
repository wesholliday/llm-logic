The original statement is: 'The exam must have covered all chapters.'\n2. The statement we want to infer is: 'The exam must have been difficult and covered all chapters.'\n\nThe original statement only asserts that the exam covered all chapters. It does not provide any information about the difficulty of the exam. The difficulty of the exam is an additional attribute that is not mentioned or implied in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the exam was difficult based solely on the information that it covered all chapters. The additional information about the difficulty is not supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
