            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been signed and notarized' from 'The document must have been notarized', we need to understand the requirements and implications of notarization. \n\nNotarization is a process that involves a notary public verifying the identity of the signers of a document and witnessing the signing. For a document to be notarized, it must first be signed in the presence of the notary. Therefore, notarization inherently includes the act of signing the document.\n\nGiven this understanding, if a document must have been notarized, it implies that it must have been signed as part of the notarization process. Thus, the statement 'The document must have been notarized' does indeed imply that the document must have been both signed and notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes",
