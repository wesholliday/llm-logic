The given statement is: 'The event must have required tickets.'\n2. The inference we are considering is: 'The event must have been formal and required tickets.'\n\nThe given statement only tells us that tickets were required for the event. It does not provide any information about the formality of the event. An event requiring tickets does not necessarily imply that it is formal. Events such as concerts, sports games, or casual gatherings can also require tickets without being formal.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the formality of the event solely based on the requirement of tickets.\n\nAnswer: no",
