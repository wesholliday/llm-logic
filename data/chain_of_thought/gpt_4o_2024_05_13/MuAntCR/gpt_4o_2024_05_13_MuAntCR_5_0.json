The original statement, 'The package must have been signed for', indicates that the package was received and a signature was provided as proof of receipt.\n2. The additional statement, 'The package must have been delivered yesterday and signed for', introduces a specific time frame (yesterday) for the delivery and signing.\n\nThe original statement does not provide any information about when the package was delivered and signed for. It only confirms that the package was signed for at some point. Therefore, we cannot infer the specific time frame of 'yesterday' from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no",
