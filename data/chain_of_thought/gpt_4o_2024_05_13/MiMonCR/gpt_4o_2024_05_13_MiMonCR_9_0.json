The original statement contains two potential outcomes: the project might be delayed, and the project might require additional funding. The use of the word 'and' indicates that both outcomes are possible. Since one of the outcomes mentioned is that the project might require additional funding, we can directly infer that this is a possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes",
