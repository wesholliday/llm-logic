The original statement has two parts: \n\n1. The recipe might be complicated.\n2. The recipe might require exotic ingredients.\n\nThe conjunction 'and' indicates that both conditions are possible. Since the second part of the statement explicitly mentions that the recipe might require exotic ingredients, we can directly infer that the recipe might indeed require exotic ingredients.\n\nAnswer: yes",
