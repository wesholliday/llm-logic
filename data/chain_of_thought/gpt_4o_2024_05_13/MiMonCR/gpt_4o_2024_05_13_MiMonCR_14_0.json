The original statement has two parts connected by 'and': \n\n1. The meeting might be confidential.\n2. The meeting might involve important decisions.\n\nThe use of 'and' indicates that both conditions are possible. Since the second part of the statement explicitly mentions that the meeting might involve important decisions, we can directly infer that possibility from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
