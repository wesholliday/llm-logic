The original statement consists of two parts: \n\n1. The technology might be revolutionary.\n2. The technology might change the industry.\n\nThe conjunction 'and' indicates that both parts are being considered together. Since the second part of the original statement explicitly states that the technology might change the industry, we can directly infer that 'The technology might change the industry' is a part of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
