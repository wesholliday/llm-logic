This means that there is at least one possible world where Mary was not at the wedding.\n- The conclusion \u25c7\u00acP states that it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding, which means there exists at least one possible world where Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nSince \u00ac\u25a1P implies that there is at least one possible world where \u00acP is true, and \u25c7\u00acP states that there is at least one possible world where \u00acP is true, the conclusion follows directly from the premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
