This implies that there is at least one possible world where Sue did not choose pizza.\n- The conclusion \"\u25c7(Sue did not choose pizza)\" means that it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza, which aligns with the idea that there is at least one possible world where Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nSince the premise \"\u00ac\u25a1(Sue chose pizza)\" directly implies the conclusion \"\u25c7(Sue did not choose pizza)\", the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
