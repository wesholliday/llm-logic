This implies that there is at least one possible world where the dog was not inside.\n- The conclusion \"\u25c7(Dog was not inside)\" means that it is possible that the dog was not inside, which aligns with the interpretation of the premise.\n\nSince the premise \"\u00ac\u25a1(Dog was inside)\" logically implies the conclusion \"\u25c7(Dog was not inside)\", the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
