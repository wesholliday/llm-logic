This implies that there is at least one possible world where the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n- The conclusion \"\u25c7(\u00acS)\" means that it is possible that the sunglasses are not in her bag, which is equivalent to saying that there is at least one possible world where the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\nSince both the premise and the conclusion essentially state that there is at least one possible world where the sunglasses are not in her bag, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
