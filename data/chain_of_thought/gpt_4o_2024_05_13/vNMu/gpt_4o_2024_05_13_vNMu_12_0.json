This implies that there is at least one possible world where the jacket is not draped over the chair. \n\nThe conclusion \u25c7(\u00acJ) means that it is possible that the jacket is not draped over the chair, which is exactly what the premise implies.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows directly from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
