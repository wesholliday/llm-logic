This implies that there is at least one possible world where B is not true.\n- \u25c7(\u00acB) means that there is at least one possible world where \u00acB is true, i.e., where the book was not written by James.\n\nSince \u00ac\u25a1(B) implies that there is at least one possible world where B is not true, it directly supports the conclusion that there is a possible world where \u00acB is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the premise logically leads to the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
