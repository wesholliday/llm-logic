This implies that there is at least one possible world where the alien did not visit Mars.\n- \u25c7(\u00acA) means that there is at least one possible world where the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nSince \u00ac\u25a1(A) implies that there is at least one possible world where the alien did not visit Mars, it directly supports the conclusion \u25c7(\u00acA).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the premise logically leads to the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
