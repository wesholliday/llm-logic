This implies that there is at least one possible world where the vampire is not awake.\n- \u25c7\u00acA means that it is possible that the vampire was not awake, which directly aligns with the idea that there is at least one possible world where the vampire is not awake.\n\nGiven that \u00ac\u25a1A implies that there is a possibility that the vampire was not awake, it logically follows that \u25c7\u00acA is true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes",
