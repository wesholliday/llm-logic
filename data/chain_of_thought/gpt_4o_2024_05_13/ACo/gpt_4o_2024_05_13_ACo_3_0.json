It tells us that if the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n\nTo infer 'The book was written by James,' we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- The conditional statement (Statement 2) tells us what happens if James wrote the book, but it does not tell us that James actually wrote the book. It only tells us that if he did, then the book would be a mystery novel.\n- Statement 1 confirms that the book is indeed a mystery novel, but it does not provide any information about the authorship of the book.\n\nThe fact that the book is a mystery novel (Statement 1) does not necessarily mean that James wrote it. There could be other authors who write mystery novels as well. Therefore, the information given is not sufficient to conclude that James wrote the book.\n\nAnswer: no",
