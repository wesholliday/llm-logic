It means that if the car is red, then it necessarily follows that the truck is blue.\n\nNow, let's consider what we need to infer 'The car was red':\n\n- We need to determine if the given statements logically lead to the conclusion that the car was red.\n\nFrom Statement 1, we know the truck is blue. However, Statement 2 only tells us what happens if the car is red; it does not provide any information about what happens if the car is not red. \n\nTo infer 'The car was red', we would need a statement that directly or indirectly confirms the car's color. The given statements do not provide such information. They only establish a condition under which the truck would be blue, but since the truck is already blue, it does not necessarily mean the car must be red. The truck being blue could be true regardless of the car's color.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The car was red' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
