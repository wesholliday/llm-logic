It tells us that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have also attended the wedding.\n\nNow, let's consider what we need to infer 'Mary was at the wedding':\n\n- For 'Mary was at the wedding' to be true, we need to find evidence or a logical necessity that Mary attended the wedding.\n\nGiven the two statements:\n- Statement 1 confirms that Sue was at the wedding.\n- Statement 2 provides a condition that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n\nHowever, the fact that Sue was at the wedding (Statement 1) does not provide any information about whether Mary was at the wedding. The conditional statement (Statement 2) only tells us what would happen if Mary were at the wedding, but it does not assert that Mary actually was at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
