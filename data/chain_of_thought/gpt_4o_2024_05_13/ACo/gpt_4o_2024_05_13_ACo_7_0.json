It means that if Alex finishes the race, then it must be true that Chris also finishes the race.\n\nNow, let's consider what we need to infer 'Alex finishes the race':\n\n- For 'Alex finishes the race' to be true, we need to find evidence that Alex indeed finished the race.\n\nHowever, the given statements do not provide any direct information about whether Alex finished the race. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if Alex finished the race, but it does not confirm that Alex actually did finish the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we cannot definitively infer that Alex finishes the race.\n\nAnswer: no",
