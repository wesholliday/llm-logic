It tells us that if the condition (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true, then the result (Mark bought the blue shirt) must also be true.\n\nNow, let's consider what we need to infer 'Lisa bought the red shirt':\n\n- For a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q), knowing that Q is true does not necessarily mean that P is true. It only tells us that if P were true, Q would follow.\n- In this case, Q (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true, but this does not provide any information about whether P (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no",
