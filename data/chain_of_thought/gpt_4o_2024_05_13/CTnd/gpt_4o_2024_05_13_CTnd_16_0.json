The original statement is: \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the job was completed\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the job was not completed well.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( Q \\) is \"the job was completed well\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the job was not completed.\"\n\nTo see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\n- The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
