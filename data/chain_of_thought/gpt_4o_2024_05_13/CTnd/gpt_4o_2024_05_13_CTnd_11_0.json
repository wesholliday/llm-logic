The original statement is: \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"I went to the store\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"I did not buy vegetables.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( Q \\) is \"I bought vegetables\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"I did not go to the store.\"\n\nTo see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the contrapositive of \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" is \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
