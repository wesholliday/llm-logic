The original statement is: \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( W \\) represents \"the clothes were washed\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the clothes were not washed properly.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg W \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the clothes were washed properly\" and \\( \\neg W \\) represents \"the clothes were not washed.\"\n\nTo see if \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) implies \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg W \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg P) \\rightarrow \\neg W \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg P) \\) gives \\( P \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg W \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly the statement we are trying to infer, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
