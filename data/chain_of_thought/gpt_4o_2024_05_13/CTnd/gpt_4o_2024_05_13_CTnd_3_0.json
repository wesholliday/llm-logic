The original statement is: \"If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\)\n   - Where \\( M \\) represents \"I ate a meal\" and \\( \\neg L \\) represents \"I did not eat a large meal.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   - Where \\( L \\) represents \"I ate a large meal\" and \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"I did not eat a meal.\"\n\nTo see if \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) implies \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg L) \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   - Simplifying, this becomes: \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n\n4. Therefore, the contrapositive of the original statement \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\) is exactly the statement we are trying to infer: \\( L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal' from 'If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
