The original statement is: \"If the issue was addressed, then it was not addressed effectively.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"the issue was addressed\" and \\( \\neg E \\) represents \"it was not addressed effectively.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n   - Where \\( E \\) represents \"the issue was addressed effectively\" and \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"it was not addressed.\"\n\nTo check if \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg E \\) implies \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg E \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg E) \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg E) \\) gives \\( E \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly the statement we are trying to infer, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
