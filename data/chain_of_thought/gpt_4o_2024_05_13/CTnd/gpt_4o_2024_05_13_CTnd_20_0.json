The original statement is: \"If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( R \\) represents \"a recommendation was made\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"it was not a strong recommendation.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the statement \"If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made\" can be inferred.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg R \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"a strong recommendation was made\" and \\( \\neg R \\) represents \"a recommendation was not made.\"\n\n3. To infer \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg R \\) from \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), we need to check if the contrapositive of the original statement matches the statement we are trying to infer.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg R \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg R \\) is logically equivalent to \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement matches the statement we are trying to infer, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
