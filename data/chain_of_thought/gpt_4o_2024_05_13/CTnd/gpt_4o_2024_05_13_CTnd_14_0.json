The original statement is: \"If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"the meal was prepared\" and \\( \\neg C \\) is \"the meal was not prepared carefully.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     where \\( C \\) is \"the meal was prepared carefully\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the meal was not prepared.\"\n\nTo see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) implies \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg C) \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Simplifying, this becomes \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is exactly the statement we are trying to infer, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
