The original statement is: \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n   - Where \\( E \\) represents \"Alex exercised\" and \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Alex did not exercise much.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)\n   - Where \\( M \\) represents \"Alex exercised much\" and \\( \\neg E \\) represents \"Alex did not exercise.\"\n\nTo see if \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) implies \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg E \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg M) \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg M) \\) gives \\( M \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg E \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can infer \\( M \\rightarrow \\neg E \\) from \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
