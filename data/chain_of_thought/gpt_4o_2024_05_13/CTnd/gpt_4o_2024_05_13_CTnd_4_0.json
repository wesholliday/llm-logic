The original statement is: \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg D \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"Ben studied\" and \\( \\neg D \\) represents \"Ben did not study diligently.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( D \\) represents \"Ben studied diligently\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"Ben did not study.\"\n\nTo infer \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg D \\), we need to check if the contrapositive or any logical equivalence can lead us to this conclusion.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) is \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n   - Applying this to our original statement: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) becomes \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg D \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
