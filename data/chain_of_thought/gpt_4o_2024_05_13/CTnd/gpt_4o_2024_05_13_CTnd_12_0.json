The original statement is: \"If Jane studied, then she did not study long.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"Jane studied\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"she did not study long.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( Q \\) is \"Jane studied long\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"she did not study.\"\n\nTo see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, since \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is given, we can infer \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
