The original statement is: \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the customer was served\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"he was not served promptly.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\"\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the customer was served promptly\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"he was not served.\"\n\nTo check if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. Therefore, the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), which matches the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served' from 'If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.'\n\nAnswer: yes",
