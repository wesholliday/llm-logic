The original statement is: \"If directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"directions were provided\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"directions were not explained clearly.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( Q \\) is \"directions were explained clearly\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"directions were not provided.\"\n\n3. To determine if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we need to understand the contrapositive.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), and the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true, we can infer \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
