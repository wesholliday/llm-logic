The original statement is: \"If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg W \\)\n   - Where \\( G \\) represents \"the customer was greeted\" and \\( \\neg W \\) represents \"the customer was not greeted warmly.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg G \\)\n   - Where \\( W \\) represents \"the customer was greeted warmly\" and \\( \\neg G \\) represents \"the customer was not greeted.\"\n\n3. To infer \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg G \\) from \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg W \\), we need to check if the contrapositive of the original statement matches the statement we want to infer.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) is \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg G \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, \\( G \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) is logically equivalent to \\( W \\rightarrow \\neg G \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement matches the statement we want to infer, we can indeed infer 'If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted' from 'If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
