The original statement is: \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg I \\)\n     where \\( D \\) represents \"the issue was discussed\" and \\( I \\) represents \"the issue was discussed in depth.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( I \\rightarrow \\neg D \\)\n\nTo see if \\( I \\rightarrow \\neg D \\) can be inferred from \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg I \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg I \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg I) \\rightarrow \\neg D \\)\n   - Simplifying, this becomes: \\( I \\rightarrow \\neg D \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg I \\) is \\( I \\rightarrow \\neg D \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
