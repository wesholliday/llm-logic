The original statement is: \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"instructions were given\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"they were not explained clearly.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( Q \\) is \"instructions were explained clearly\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"instructions were not given.\"\n\nTo see if \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) implies \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, since \\( Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
