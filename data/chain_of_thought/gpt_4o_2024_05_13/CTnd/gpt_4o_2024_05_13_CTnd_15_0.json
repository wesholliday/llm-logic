The original statement is: \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg T_t \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents \"the room was tidied\" and \\( \\neg T_t \\) represents \"the room was not tidied thoroughly.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T_t \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n   - Where \\( T_t \\) represents \"the room was tidied thoroughly\" and \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"the room was not tidied.\"\n\nTo check if \\( T_t \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) can be inferred from \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg T_t \\), we need to consider the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg T_t \\) is \\( T_t \\rightarrow \\neg T \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince \\( T_t \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is the contrapositive of \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg T_t \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer \\( T_t \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) from \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg T_t \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
