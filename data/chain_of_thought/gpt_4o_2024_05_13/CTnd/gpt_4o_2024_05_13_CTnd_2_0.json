The original statement is: \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n   - Where \\( E \\) represents \"Ann exercised\" and \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"Ann did not exercise strenuously.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"Ann exercised strenuously\" and \\( \\neg E \\) represents \"Ann did not exercise.\"\n\nTo see if \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) implies \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\), we can use the contrapositive rule in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and they are logically equivalent.\n\n3. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg S) \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg S) \\) gives \\( S \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of \\( E \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is \\( S \\rightarrow \\neg E \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can infer the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
