The original statement is: \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) represents \"the room was cleaned\" and \\( \\neg T \\) represents \"the room was not cleaned thoroughly.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   - Where \\( T \\) represents \"the room was cleaned thoroughly\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the room was not cleaned.\"\n\nTo see if \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) can be inferred from \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg T) \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg T) \\) gives \\( T \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\) is \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer \\( T \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) from \\( C \\rightarrow \\neg T \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
