            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If it's raining hard, then it's not raining' from 'If it's raining, then it's not raining hard', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\)\n   - Where \\( R \\) represents \"it's raining\" and \\( H \\) represents \"it's raining hard.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\)\n\nTo see if \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\) can be inferred from \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\), we can use the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n3. The contrapositive of \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\) is:\n   - \\( \\neg (\\neg H) \\rightarrow \\neg R \\)\n   - Simplifying \\( \\neg (\\neg H) \\) gives \\( H \\)\n   - So, the contrapositive is: \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\)\n\nSince the contrapositive of \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\) is \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\), and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg R \\) from \\( R \\rightarrow \\neg H \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
