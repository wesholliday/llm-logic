The original statement is: \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg H \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"advice was offered\" and \\( H \\) represents \"helpful advice.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n\n3. To infer \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) from \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg H \\), we need to see if the contrapositive of the original statement supports this inference.\n   - The contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg H \\) is \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, \\( H \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is logically equivalent to \\( A \\rightarrow \\neg H \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement matches the statement we are trying to infer, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
