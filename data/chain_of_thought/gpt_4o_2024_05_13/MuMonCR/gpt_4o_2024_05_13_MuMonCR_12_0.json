            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The project must have been completed by Friday and under budget\" contains two conditions that must both be true: the project must have been completed by Friday, and the project must have been under budget. These conditions are connected by the conjunction \"and,\" which means both conditions are required.\n\nTo infer whether \"The project must have been under budget\" is true, we need to consider if the original statement implies this condition independently. Since the original statement explicitly states that the project must have been under budget as one of the required conditions, we can directly infer that this condition must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the project must have been under budget based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
