            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been notarized' from 'The document must have been signed and notarized', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement. The original statement indicates that two conditions must be met: the document must be signed and it must be notarized. For both conditions to be true, each individual condition must also be true. Therefore, if the document must have been both signed and notarized, it logically follows that the document must have been notarized.\n\nAnswer: yes",
