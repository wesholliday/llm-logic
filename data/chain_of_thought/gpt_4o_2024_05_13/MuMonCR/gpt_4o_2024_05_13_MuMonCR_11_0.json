            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The software must have been restarted' from 'The software must have been updated and restarted', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement. The original statement consists of two actions connected by 'and': the software being updated and the software being restarted. For the entire statement to be true, both actions must have occurred. Therefore, if the software must have been updated and restarted, it logically follows that the software must have been restarted as part of that process.\n\nAnswer: yes",
