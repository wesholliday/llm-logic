The application must have been completed online.\n2. The application must have included references.\n\nThe conjunction 'and' indicates that both conditions must be true for the original statement to hold. Therefore, if the original statement is true, both conditions must be satisfied.\n\nSince one of the conditions explicitly states that the application must have included references, we can directly infer that 'The application must have included references' is true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
