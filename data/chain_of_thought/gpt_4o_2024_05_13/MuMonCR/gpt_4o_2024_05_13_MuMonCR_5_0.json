The package must have been delivered today.\n2. The package must have been signed for.\n\nThe conjunction \"and\" indicates that both conditions must be true. Therefore, if the entire statement is true, then both individual parts must also be true. \n\nSince one of the parts of the statement is \"The package must have been signed for,\" and the entire statement is asserted to be true, we can infer that \"The package must have been signed for\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
