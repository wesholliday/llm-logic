            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The concert must have started at 8 PM' from the statement 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM', we need to analyze the logical structure of the original statement.\n\nThe original statement is a conjunction of two conditions:\n1. The concert must have been sold out.\n2. The concert must have started at 8 PM.\n\nIn logical terms, a conjunction (AND statement) is true if and only if both of its components are true. Therefore, if the entire conjunction is true, each individual component must also be true.\n\nGiven that the original statement asserts both conditions together, it implies that each condition is true on its own. Thus, if 'The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM' is true, then 'The concert must have started at 8 PM' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
