            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The application must have been completed online,\" specifies that the application process was required to be done online. This means that the only acceptable method for completing the application was through an online platform.\n\nThe inference, \"The application must have been completed in person or online,\" suggests that there are two acceptable methods for completing the application: either in person or online. This is a broader statement that includes an additional option (in person) that was not mentioned in the original statement.\n\nSince the original statement only specifies the online method and does not mention the possibility of completing the application in person, we cannot infer that completing the application in person was also an acceptable option.\n\nAnswer: no",
