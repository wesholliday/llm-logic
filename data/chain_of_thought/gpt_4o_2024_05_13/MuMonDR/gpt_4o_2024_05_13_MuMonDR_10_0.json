            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The document must have been notarized or signed' from 'The document must have been signed', we need to analyze the logical relationship between the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is 'The document must have been signed'. This means that the document has a signature on it.\n2. The inferred statement is 'The document must have been notarized or signed'. This statement presents two possibilities: either the document was notarized, or it was signed, or both.\n\nSince the original statement only confirms that the document was signed, it does not provide any information about notarization. However, the inferred statement includes the possibility of the document being signed, which aligns with the original statement. Therefore, the inferred statement is broader and includes the original statement as one of its possibilities.\n\nThus, the original statement 'The document must have been signed' logically supports the inferred statement 'The document must have been notarized or signed' because the signing is a subset of the possibilities presented in the inferred statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
