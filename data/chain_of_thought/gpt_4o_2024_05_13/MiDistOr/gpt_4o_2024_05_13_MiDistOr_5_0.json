            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow' from 'The package might be delivered today or tomorrow', we need to analyze the logical structure of both statements.\n\n1. The original statement 'The package might be delivered today or tomorrow' suggests that there are two possible days for the delivery: today or tomorrow. It implies that the delivery could happen on either of these days, but it does not specify whether it could happen on both days or just one of them.\n\n2. The inferred statement 'The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow' breaks down the original statement into two separate possibilities: one where the package might be delivered today and another where the package might be delivered tomorrow. This explicitly states that each day is a separate possibility for the delivery.\n\nSince the original statement already implies that the delivery could happen on either today or tomorrow, breaking it down into two separate possibilities does not change the meaning. Therefore, the inferred statement is a valid interpretation of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
