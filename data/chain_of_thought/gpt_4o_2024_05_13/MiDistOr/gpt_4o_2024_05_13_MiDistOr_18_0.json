The rephrased statement, \"The medicine might be taken with food or it might be taken on an empty stomach,\" essentially breaks down the original statement into two separate possibilities, maintaining the same meaning. Both statements indicate that there are two acceptable ways to take the medicine. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
