            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document might be signed or notarized\" suggests that there are two possibilities for the document: it could be signed, or it could be notarized, or it could be both. The use of \"or\" in this context is inclusive, meaning that one or both conditions could be true.\n\nWhen we rephrase it to \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized,\" we are essentially breaking down the original statement into its two possible conditions. This rephrasing still captures the same meaning: the document could be signed, or it could be notarized, or it could be both.\n\nTherefore, the inference \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized\" is consistent with the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
