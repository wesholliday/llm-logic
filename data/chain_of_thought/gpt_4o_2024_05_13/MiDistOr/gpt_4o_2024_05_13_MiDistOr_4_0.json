            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled\" presents two possible outcomes for the meeting: it might start at 2 PM, or it might be cancelled. The rephrased statement \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled\" essentially conveys the same two possible outcomes, but it explicitly states both possibilities using \"might\" for each. Both statements indicate uncertainty and present the same alternatives for the meeting's status. Therefore, the rephrased statement is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
