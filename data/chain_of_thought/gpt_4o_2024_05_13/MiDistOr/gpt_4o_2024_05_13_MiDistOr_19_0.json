            "content": "Explanation: The original statement, \"The application might be completed online or in person,\" indicates that there are two possible methods for completing the application: online or in person. The phrase \"or\" suggests that either one of these methods can be used, but it does not specify that both methods must be used simultaneously. \n\nThe inferred statement, \"The application might be completed online or it might be completed in person,\" essentially restates the same idea, emphasizing that there are two distinct options for completing the application. It breaks down the original statement into two separate possibilities, which aligns with the meaning of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
