The logical structure of both statements is equivalent, as they both indicate that the floob must fulfill at least one of the two conditions.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The floob must quorple a zizz or it must quorple a zump' from 'The floob must quorple a zizz or quorple a zump'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
