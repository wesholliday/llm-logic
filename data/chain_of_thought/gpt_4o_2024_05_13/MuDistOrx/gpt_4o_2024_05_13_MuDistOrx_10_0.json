The logical structure of the statement is \"A or B,\" where A is \"the flibbit must be snork\" and B is \"the flibbit must be bimboozle.\"\n\nThe inferred statement is \"The flibbit must be snork or it must be bimboozle.\" This statement also presents the same two alternatives: either the flibbit must be snork, or it must be bimboozle. The logical structure of this statement is also \"A or B,\" where A is \"the flibbit must be snork\" and B is \"it must be bimboozle.\"\n\nSince both statements present the same two alternatives in a disjunctive form, they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes",
