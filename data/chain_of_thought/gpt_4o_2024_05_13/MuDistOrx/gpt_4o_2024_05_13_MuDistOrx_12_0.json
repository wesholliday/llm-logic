This can be broken down into two parts:\n1. The quibble must be floob on the froodle.\n2. The quibble must be snork on the zump.\n\nThe word 'or' in the original statement indicates that at least one of these conditions must be true. The rephrased statement is: 'The quibble must be floob on the froodle or it must be snork on the zump'. This rephrased statement essentially means the same thing: at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\nSince both statements convey that at least one of the conditions must hold true, we can infer the rephrased statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
