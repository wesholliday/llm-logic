In logical terms, it can be written as:\n     - If P (the twonk was plinked), then Q (the twonk was varnished).\n     - Symbolically: P \u2192 Q\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The twonk might not have been varnished.\"\n   - This statement suggests that it is possible that the twonk was not varnished.\n   - In logical terms, this means that \u00acQ (not Q) is possible.\n\nTo infer 'The twonk was not plinked' (\u00acP), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From Statement 1 (P \u2192 Q), we know that if the twonk was plinked, it must have been varnished.\n- From Statement 2, we know that it is possible that the twonk was not varnished (\u00acQ).\n\nIf \u00acQ is possible, then according to the contrapositive of the conditional statement (P \u2192 Q), we can infer \u00acP (if Q is false, then P must be false).\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that the twonk was not varnished (\u00acQ), then it must be possible that the twonk was not plinked (\u00acP).\n\nAnswer: yes",
