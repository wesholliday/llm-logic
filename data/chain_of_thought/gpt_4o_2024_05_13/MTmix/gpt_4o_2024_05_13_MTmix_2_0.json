The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug must have bimmed the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( F \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( F \\) represents \"the wug was flooped\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wug might not have bimmed the zoint.\"\n   - This means that it is possible that \\( B \\) is false.\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer 'The wug was not flooped' (which is \\( \\neg F \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n3. From the first statement \\( F \\rightarrow B \\), we know that if \\( F \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must be true.\n   - If \\( B \\) is false (\\( \\neg B \\)), then \\( F \\) cannot be true because it would violate the conditional statement \\( F \\rightarrow B \\).\n\n4. The second statement tells us that \\( B \\) might not be true, which means \\( \\neg B \\) is possible.\n   - If \\( \\neg B \\) is possible, then \\( F \\) cannot be true because \\( F \\rightarrow B \\) would be violated.\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that \\( B \\) is false, then \\( F \\) must be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
