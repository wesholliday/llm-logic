This means if \\( Q \\) is false, then \\( P \\) must also be false.\n\n4. **Considering the possibility:**\n   - Statement 2 says that \\( Q \\) might not be true (\\( \\neg Q \\) is possible).\n   - However, it does not definitively state that \\( Q \\) is false. It only suggests that \\( Q \\) might be false.\n\nSince Statement 2 only indicates a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively conclude \\( \\neg Q \\). Therefore, we cannot definitively use the contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) to infer \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven that Statement 2 only suggests a possibility and not a certainty, we cannot definitively infer \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
