In logical terms, it can be written as: \n     - If P (the shank was plooked), then Q (the shank was nugged).\n     - Symbolically: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n\n2. **Statement 2: \"The shank might not have been nugged.\"**\n   - This statement suggests that it is possible that the shank was not nugged.\n   - In logical terms, this means that \\( \\neg Q \\) (not Q) is possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From the first statement (\\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)), if the shank was plooked (P), then it must have been nugged (Q).\n- The second statement (\\( \\neg Q \\) is possible) implies that it is possible that Q is false.\n\nTo infer \"The shank was not plooked\" (\\( \\neg P \\)), we need to consider the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- The contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n- This means: If the shank was not nugged (\\( \\neg Q \\)), then the shank was not plooked (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nGiven that it is possible that \\( \\neg Q \\) (the shank might not have been nugged), we can infer that it is possible that \\( \\neg P \\) (the shank was not plooked).\n\nHowever, the possibility of \\( \\neg Q \\) does not guarantee \\( \\neg Q \\). It only suggests that \\( \\neg Q \\) is a potential scenario. Therefore, while it is possible that the shank was not plooked, we cannot definitively infer it based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
