In logical terms, it can be written as:\n     - If \\( C \\) (the sprocket was cranked), then \\( D \\) (the sprocket was daggled).\n     - Symbolically: \\( C \\rightarrow D \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2: \"The sprocket might not have been daggled.\"**\n   - This means that it is possible that the sprocket was not daggled.\n   - In logical terms, this can be written as:\n     - \\( \\neg D \\) is possible (where \\( \\neg D \\) means \"not daggled\").\n\n3. **Inference: \"The sprocket was not cranked.\"**\n   - We need to determine if \\( \\neg C \\) (the sprocket was not cranked) can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nLet's use the contrapositive of the first statement to help with the inference:\n- The contrapositive of \\( C \\rightarrow D \\) is \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n- This means: If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nGiven that \"The sprocket might not have been daggled\" (i.e., \\( \\neg D \\) is possible), we can use the contrapositive:\n- If \\( \\neg D \\) (the sprocket was not daggled), then \\( \\neg C \\) (the sprocket was not cranked).\n\nSince \\( \\neg D \\) is possible, it implies that \\( \\neg C \\) (the sprocket was not cranked) must be true if \\( \\neg D \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from the possibility that the sprocket was not daggled, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
