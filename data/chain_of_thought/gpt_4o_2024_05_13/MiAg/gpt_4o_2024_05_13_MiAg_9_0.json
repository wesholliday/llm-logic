The first part of the statement is 'The package might be delivered today'. This indicates the possibility that the package will arrive today.\n2. The second part of the statement is 'The package might be damaged'. This indicates the possibility that the package is in a damaged state.\n\nCombining these two possibilities, we can consider the scenario where both conditions are true simultaneously:\n- The package is delivered today.\n- The package is damaged.\n\nIf both conditions are true at the same time, it means there is a possibility that the package, when delivered today, is in a damaged state. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer that 'The package might be delivered damaged today' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes",
