The original statement is: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow S \\)\n     where \\( B \\) represents \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the fleeg surned\".\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is the contrapositive of \\( B \\rightarrow S \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if \\( B \\rightarrow S \\) is true, then \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
