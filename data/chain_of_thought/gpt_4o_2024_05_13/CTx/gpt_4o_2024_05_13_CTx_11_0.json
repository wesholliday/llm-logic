The original statement is: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the flug was blummed\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"the flug was zimmed.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg Z \\) represents \"the flug was not zimmed\" and \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the flug was not blummed.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\) (if \\( B \\) then \\( Z \\)) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) (if not \\( Z \\) then not \\( B \\)).\n\n4. Therefore, if we have \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\), we can infer \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
