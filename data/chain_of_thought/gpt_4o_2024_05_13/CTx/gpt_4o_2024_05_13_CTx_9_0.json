The original statement is: \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow V \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the twonk was plinked\"\n     - And \\( V \\) represents \"the twonk was varnished\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the statement \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" can be inferred.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg V \\) represents \"the twonk was not varnished\"\n     - And \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the twonk was not plinked\"\n\n3. In logic, the statement \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is the contrapositive of the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow V \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow V \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
