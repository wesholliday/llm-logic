The original statement is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if the statement \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" can be inferred.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if the original statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
