The original statement is: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   - Where \\( B \\) represents \"the flugel was blimmed\" and \\( Z \\) represents \"the flugel was zargled\".\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg Z \\) represents \"the flugel was not zargled\" and \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the flugel was not blimmed\".\n\nIn logic, the statement \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is the contrapositive of the statement \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\). In classical logic, a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive. Therefore, if \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
