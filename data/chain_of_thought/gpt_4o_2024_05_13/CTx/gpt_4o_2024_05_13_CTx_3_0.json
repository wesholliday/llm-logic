The original statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"the splat was morphed\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the splat quanked.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
