The original statement is: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( F \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( F \\) represents \"the zinger was fraggled\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the zinger was smoogled\".\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the zinger was not smoogled\" and \\( \\neg F \\) represents \"the zinger was not fraggled\".\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of the original statement \\( F \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\).\n\nSince \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\) is the contrapositive of \\( F \\rightarrow S \\), and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg F \\) from \\( F \\rightarrow S \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
