The original statement is: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow T \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents \"the whiffle was shanked\" and \\( T \\) represents \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow T \\). The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow T \\), and they are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
