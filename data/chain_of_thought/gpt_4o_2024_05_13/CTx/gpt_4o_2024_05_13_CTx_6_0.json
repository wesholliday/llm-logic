The original statement is: \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"the grommet was sploffed\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"the grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the grommet did not plop the frink\"\n     - And \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the grommet was not sploffed\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if P then Q) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (if not Q then not P).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
