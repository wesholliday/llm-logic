The original statement is: 'If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow C \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents 'the fribble was snurgled' and \\( C \\) represents 'the fribble crinked'.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: 'If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow C \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if \\( S \\rightarrow C \\) is true, then \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
