The original statement is: 'If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow T \\)\n     where \\( S \\) represents 'the glip was slogged' and \\( T \\) represents 'the glip was tragged'.\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: 'If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.'\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n     where \\( \\neg T \\) represents 'the glip was not tragged' and \\( \\neg S \\) represents 'the glip was not slogged'.\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow T \\). The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is the contrapositive of \\( S \\rightarrow T \\), and the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) from \\( S \\rightarrow T \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
