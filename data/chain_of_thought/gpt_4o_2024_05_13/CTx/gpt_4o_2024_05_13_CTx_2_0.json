            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped' from 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the wug was flooped\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the wug did not bim the zoint\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the wug was not flooped.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\)) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (if not \\( Q \\) then not \\( P \\)).\n\nSince \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), and a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
