The original statement is: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"the flob was skizzled\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"the flob movated\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the flob did not movate\"\n     - And \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the flob was not skizzled\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\)) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (if not \\( Q \\) then not \\( P \\)).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
