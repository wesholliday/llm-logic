The original statement is: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow P \\)\n     - Where \\( V \\) represents \"the smonk was vreebled\"\n     - And \\( P \\) represents \"the smonk plagged\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the smonk did not plagged\"\n     - And \\( \\neg V \\) represents \"the smonk was not vreebled\"\n\nIn logic, \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) is the contrapositive of \\( V \\rightarrow P \\). In classical logic, a statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive. Therefore, if \\( V \\rightarrow P \\) is true, then \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
