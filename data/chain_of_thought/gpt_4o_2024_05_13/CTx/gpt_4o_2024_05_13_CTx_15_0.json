The original statement is: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow S \\)\n     where \\( V \\) represents \"the dreb was vroombed\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) is the contrapositive of \\( V \\rightarrow S \\).\n\n4. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, if \\( V \\rightarrow S \\) is true, then \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg V \\) must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
