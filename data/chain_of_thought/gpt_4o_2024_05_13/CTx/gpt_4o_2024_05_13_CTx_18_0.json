The original statement is: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow N \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) represents \"the shank was plooked\" and \\( N \\) represents \"the shank was nugged.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg N \\) represents \"the shank was not nugged\" and \\( \\neg P \\) represents \"the shank was not plooked.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( \\neg N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) is the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow N \\).\n   - The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg N \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow N \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
