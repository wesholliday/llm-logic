The given statement is: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the smip was shripped\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the smip did not lup the zoint\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the smip was not shripped.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\)) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (if not \\( Q \\) then not \\( P \\)).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
