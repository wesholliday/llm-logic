The original statement is: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"the clug was fleeked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the clug snugged.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\)\n     where \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the clug did not snugged\" and \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\n3. In logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) (if \\( P \\) then \\( Q \\)) is equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) (if not \\( Q \\) then not \\( P \\)).\n\nSince the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\) from \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
