            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged' from 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled', we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements.\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow G \\)\n     - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the wug was sproinged\"\n     - And \\( G \\) represents \"the wug was garpled\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg G \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg G \\) represents \"the wug was not garpled\"\n     - And \\( \\neg S \\) represents \"the wug was not sproinged\"\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. The original statement \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) has a contrapositive \\( \\neg G \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nSince the contrapositive of the original statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer 'If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged' from 'If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
