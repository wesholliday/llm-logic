It tells us that if the grommet was sploffed, then as a result, the grommet would plop the frink.\n\nTo infer 'The grommet was sploffed', we need to determine if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- The conditional statement (Statement 2) tells us what happens if the grommet was sploffed, but it does not tell us that the grommet was indeed sploffed.\n- Statement 1 confirms that the grommet plopped the frink, but it does not provide information about whether the grommet was sploffed or not.\n\nIn logical terms, the conditional statement (Statement 2) is of the form \"If P, then Q.\" Knowing Q (the grommet plopped the frink) does not allow us to conclude P (the grommet was sploffed) because there could be other reasons for Q to be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that 'The grommet was sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: no",
