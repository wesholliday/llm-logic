The first statement is: \"The fribble crinked.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n\nWe need to determine if 'The fribble was snurgled' can be inferred from these statements.\n\n- The first statement tells us that the fribble crinked.\n- The second statement is a conditional statement: If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n\nIn logical terms, the second statement can be written as:\n- If P (the fribble was snurgled), then Q (the fribble crinked).\n\nGiven that Q (the fribble crinked) is true (from the first statement), we need to determine if P (the fribble was snurgled) must also be true.\n\nHowever, the truth of Q (the fribble crinked) does not necessarily imply the truth of P (the fribble was snurgled). The conditional statement only tells us what happens if P is true, but it does not tell us that P must be true if Q is true. There could be other reasons why the fribble crinked.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The fribble was snurgled' solely based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
