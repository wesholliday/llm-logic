It tells us that plinking the twonk is a sufficient condition for it to be varnished. In other words, if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\n\nNow, let's consider what we need to infer 'The twonk was plinked':\n\n- From Statement 1, we know the twonk was varnished.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the twonk was plinked, it would be varnished.\n\nHowever, knowing that the twonk was varnished does not necessarily mean it was plinked. There could be other reasons or conditions under which the twonk was varnished that are not mentioned in the statements. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the twonk was plinked, not that plinking is the only way for the twonk to be varnished.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the twonk was plinked based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
