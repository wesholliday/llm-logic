The first statement is: \"The fribble was crinked.\"\n   - This tells us that the fribble has indeed been crinked.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble was crinked.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must also have been crinked.\n\nTo infer \"The fribble was snurgled,\" we need to see if the given information logically leads to this conclusion.\n\n- From the first statement, we know the fribble was crinked.\n- The second statement tells us that snurgling the fribble would result in it being crinked, but it does not tell us that crinkling the fribble necessarily means it was snurgled.\n\nIn logical terms, the second statement is of the form \"If P, then Q\" (P \u2192 Q). Knowing Q (the fribble was crinked) does not allow us to infer P (the fribble was snurgled) because there could be other reasons for Q to be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The fribble was snurgled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
