It tells us that being sproinged is a sufficient condition for being garpled. In other words, if the wug was sproinged, then it must also be garpled.\n\nTo infer 'The wug was sproinged', we need to determine if the given information logically leads to this conclusion.\n\n- From Statement 1, we know the wug was garpled.\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled. However, this does not mean that being garpled necessarily implies being sproinged. There could be other reasons or conditions under which the wug could be garpled.\n\nTherefore, knowing that the wug was garpled does not allow us to definitively conclude that the wug was sproinged, because the conditional statement only works in one direction (sproinged implies garpled, but not necessarily the reverse).\n\nAnswer: no",
