It tells us that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled.\n\nNow, let's consider what we need to infer 'The flugel was blimmed':\n\n- To infer 'The flugel was blimmed', we would need evidence that directly or indirectly confirms that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nFrom Statement 1, we know the flugel was zargled. However, this does not provide any information about whether the flugel was blimmed. It only confirms the outcome (zargled).\n\nFrom Statement 2, we know that if the flugel was blimmed, then it was zargled. But this is a one-way implication. It does not state that if the flugel was zargled, then it must have been blimmed. Therefore, knowing that the flugel was zargled does not allow us to conclude that it was blimmed.\n\nIn logical terms, the conditional statement (if P then Q) does not imply its converse (if Q then P).\n\nThus, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the flugel was blimmed.\n\nAnswer: no",
