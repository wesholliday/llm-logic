It tells us that if the splat was morphed, then it must also be quanked.\n\nTo infer 'The splat was morphed,' we need to see if the given information logically leads to this conclusion.\n\n- From Statement 1, we know the splat was quanked.\n- From Statement 2, we know that being morphed is a sufficient condition for being quanked, but it is not a necessary condition. In other words, the splat being quanked does not necessarily mean it was morphed; it could have been quanked for some other reason.\n\nTherefore, knowing that the splat was quanked does not allow us to conclude that it was morphed, because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if the splat was morphed, not that it must have been morphed to be quanked.\n\nAnswer: no",
