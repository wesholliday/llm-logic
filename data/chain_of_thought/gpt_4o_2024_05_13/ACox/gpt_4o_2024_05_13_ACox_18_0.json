The first statement is: \"The sprocket was daggled.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nWe need to determine if these statements allow us to infer that \"The sprocket was cranked.\"\n\n- The first statement tells us that the sprocket was daggled.\n- The second statement is a conditional statement: If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\nThe conditional statement does not provide information about what happens if the sprocket was not cranked. It only tells us that cranking the sprocket would result in it being daggled.\n\nGiven that we know the sprocket was daggled, this does not necessarily mean that it was cranked. There could be other reasons why the sprocket was daggled that are not mentioned in the statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer that the sprocket was cranked based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no",
