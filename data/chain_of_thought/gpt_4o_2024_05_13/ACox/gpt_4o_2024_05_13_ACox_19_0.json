It tells us that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. However, it does not tell us anything about whether the twonk was actually plinked or not.\n\nTo infer 'The twonk was plinked,' we need to establish that the twonk was indeed plinked. The conditional statement (Statement 2) only tells us what happens if the twonk was plinked, but it does not confirm that the twonk was plinked. \n\nStatement 1 confirms that the twonk was varnished, but it does not provide any information about whether it was plinked. \n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we cannot definitively infer that the twonk was plinked.\n\nAnswer: no",
