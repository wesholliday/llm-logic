It means that if the grommet was sploffed, then it must also be plopped.\n\nTo infer 'The grommet was sploffed', we need to check if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From Statement 1, we know the grommet was plopped.\n- Statement 2 tells us that being sploffed is a sufficient condition for being plopped, but it does not state that being plopped necessarily means being sploffed.\n\nIn logical terms, Statement 2 can be written as:\n- If P (sploffed), then Q (plopped).\n\nHowever, knowing Q (the grommet was plopped) does not allow us to infer P (the grommet was sploffed) because there could be other reasons for the grommet being plopped that do not involve it being sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The grommet was sploffed' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
