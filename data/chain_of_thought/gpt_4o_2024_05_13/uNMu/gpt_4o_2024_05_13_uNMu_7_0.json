The phrase \"must have finished\" implies a necessity or certainty that Alex finished the race.\n2. The negation \"It's not the case that\" means that it is not necessarily true that Alex finished the race.\n\nBy negating the necessity, we are left with the possibility that Alex did not finish the race. This means that there is no certainty that Alex finished the race, and therefore, it is possible that Alex might not have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
