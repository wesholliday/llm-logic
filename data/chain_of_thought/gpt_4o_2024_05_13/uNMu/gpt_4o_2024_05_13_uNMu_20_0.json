            "content": "To determine if we can infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag, let's break down the statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\"\n\n1. The original statement is a negation of a necessity: \"the sunglasses must be in her bag.\"\n2. If it is not necessary for the sunglasses to be in her bag, this means that there is a possibility that they are not in her bag.\n3. Therefore, the statement implies that it is not certain that the sunglasses are in her bag, which means there is a chance they might not be in her bag.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can infer that the sunglasses might not be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
