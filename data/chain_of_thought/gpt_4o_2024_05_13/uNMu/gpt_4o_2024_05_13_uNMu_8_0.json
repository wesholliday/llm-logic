The original statement is a negation of a necessity: \"must have been awake.\"\n2. If something \"must have been awake,\" it means it is necessary that it was awake.\n3. The negation of this necessity is: \"It is not necessary that the vampire was awake.\"\n4. If it is not necessary that the vampire was awake, it means there is a possibility that the vampire was not awake.\n\nTherefore, from the statement \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake,\" we can infer that it is possible that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes",
