The phrase \"Sue must have chosen pizza\" implies that it is certain or necessary that Sue chose pizza.\n2. The negation of this phrase, \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza,\" means that it is not certain or necessary that Sue chose pizza. In other words, there is no requirement or guarantee that Sue chose pizza.\n\nGiven this negation, we can infer that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza. This means that it is not certain that she chose pizza, and therefore, she might not have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
