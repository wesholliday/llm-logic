The given statement is: \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\"\n2. This statement can be rephrased as: \"It is not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet.\"\n3. If it is not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet, this means that there is a possibility that the shoes are not in the closet.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the shoes might not be in the closet because the statement allows for the possibility that the shoes could be elsewhere.\n\nAnswer: yes",
