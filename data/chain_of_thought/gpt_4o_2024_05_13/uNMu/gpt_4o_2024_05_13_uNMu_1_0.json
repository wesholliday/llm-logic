The phrase \"Mary must have been at the wedding\" implies that it is certain or necessary that Mary was at the wedding.\n2. The negation of this phrase, \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding,\" means that it is not certain or necessary that Mary was at the wedding. In other words, it is possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nGiven that it is not certain that Mary was at the wedding, it opens up the possibility that she might not have been there. Therefore, we can infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
