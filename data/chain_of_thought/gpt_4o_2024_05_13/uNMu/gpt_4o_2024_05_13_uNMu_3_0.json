The phrase \"must have been written by James\" implies a necessity or certainty that James is the author.\n2. The negation \"It's not the case that\" negates this necessity or certainty.\n\nSo, the statement \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" means that it is not necessarily true that James is the author. This implies that there is a possibility that someone else could be the author.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the book might not have been written by James, as the statement allows for the possibility that James is not the author.\n\nAnswer: yes",
