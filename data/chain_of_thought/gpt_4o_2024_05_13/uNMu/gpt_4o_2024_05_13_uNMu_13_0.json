The phrase \"the toy must be in the toy box\" implies that it is necessary for the toy to be in the toy box.\n2. The negation of this phrase, \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box,\" means that it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box.\n3. If it is not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box, then there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the toy might not be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
