The phrase \"must have been\" implies a necessity or certainty.\n2. The negation \"It's not the case that\" implies that the necessity or certainty is being denied.\n\nSo, the statement \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" means that it is not necessarily true that the griffin was in the forest. This opens up the possibility that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes",
