The original statement is a negation of a necessity: \"the alien must have visited Mars.\"\n2. If we negate this necessity, it means that it is not necessarily true that the alien visited Mars.\n3. This implies that there is a possibility that the alien did not visit Mars.\n4. Therefore, it is possible that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can infer that the alien might not have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
