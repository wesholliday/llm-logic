It tells us what would happen if the dog were inside, but it does not directly tell us anything about the actual situation since the dog is not inside.\n\nNow, let's consider what we need to infer: \"The cat was not outside.\"\n\nTo infer this, we need to establish that the cat was inside. However, the given statements do not provide direct information about the cat's location when the dog is outside. The conditional statement only tells us about the cat's location if the dog were inside, which it is not.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude the cat's location when the dog is outside.\n\nAnswer: no",
