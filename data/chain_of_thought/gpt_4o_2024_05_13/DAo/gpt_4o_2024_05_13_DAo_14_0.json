The first statement is: \"The bear was not in the cave.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acB (where B represents \"The bear was in the cave\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   - This can be written as: B \u2192 W (where W represents \"The wolf was in the den\").\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acW (The wolf was not in the den) from \u00acB and B \u2192 W.\n\nLet's use logical reasoning:\n\n- We know \u00acB (The bear was not in the cave).\n- We also know B \u2192 W (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den).\n\nIn propositional logic, an implication B \u2192 W is true if either B is false or W is true. Since we know \u00acB (B is false), the implication B \u2192 W is true regardless of the truth value of W.\n\nHowever, knowing \u00acB and B \u2192 W does not provide any information about the truth value of W directly. The wolf could still be in the den or not in the den independently of the bear's location.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \u00acW (The wolf was not in the den) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
