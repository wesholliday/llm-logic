It can be written in logical form as: \\( \\text{If } P \\text{ then } Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nTo infer 'The pants were not denim,' we need to understand the logical implications of the given statements.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( \\text{If } P \\text{ then } Q \\) does not provide any information about what happens if \\( P \\) is false. It only tells us what happens if \\( P \\) is true.\n- From Statement 1, we know \\( P \\) (the shirt was cotton) is false.\n- When \\( P \\) is false, the conditional statement \\( \\text{If } P \\text{ then } Q \\) does not give us any information about \\( Q \\) (the pants were denim). The truth value of \\( Q \\) can be either true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot definitively infer the truth value of 'The pants were not denim.'\n\nAnswer: no",
