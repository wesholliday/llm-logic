Therefore, \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) does not provide any information about \\( S \\) when \\( M \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg M \\), we cannot determine the truth value of \\( S \\) directly from the given statements. \\( S \\) could be true or false independently of \\( M \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
