It only specifies what happens if Tom did watch football. Therefore, knowing that Tom did not watch football (\u00acF) does not give us any information about whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\nIn logical terms, \u00acF does not affect the truth value of B in the context of the given conditional statement. The conditional statement only restricts the scenario where F is true.\n\nThus, we cannot infer \u00acB (Jen did not watch basketball) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
