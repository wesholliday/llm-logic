The first statement is: \"The book was not written by James.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nWe need to determine if these statements logically lead to the conclusion: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James (P), then the book is a mystery novel (Q).\" This can be written as \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\n- The first statement tells us that \"The book was not written by James.\" This is the negation of \\( P \\), which can be written as \\( \\neg P \\).\n\nIn logical terms, we have:\n1. \\( \\neg P \\)\n2. \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n\nFrom these, we need to infer \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nHowever, in classical logic, from \\( \\neg P \\) and \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), we cannot directly infer \\( \\neg Q \\). The reason is that the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide any information about what happens when \\( P \\) is false. It only tells us what happens if \\( P \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, the given statements do not provide enough information to conclude that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no",
