However, since \u00acA is true (the alien did not visit Mars), the condition A (the alien visited Mars) is false.\n\nIn logic, an implication A \u2192 R is true if the antecedent (A) is false, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (R). Therefore, the truth of A \u2192 R does not provide any information about the truth value of R when A is false.\n\nSince \u00acA does not provide any information about R, we cannot infer \u00acR from \u00acA and A \u2192 R.\n\nAnswer: no",
