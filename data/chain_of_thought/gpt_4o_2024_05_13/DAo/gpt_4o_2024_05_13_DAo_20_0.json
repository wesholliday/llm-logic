            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The banana was not yellow' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"The apple was not red.\"\n   - This means the apple is some color other than red.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider what we need to infer: \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n\nTo infer this, we need to show that the banana being yellow leads to a contradiction with the given statements. \n\n- The conditional statement (Statement 2) only tells us what happens if the apple is red. It does not provide any information about the color of the banana if the apple is not red.\n- Since Statement 1 tells us that the apple is not red, the condition in Statement 2 is not met. Therefore, Statement 2 does not provide any information about the banana's color in this case.\n\nGiven that we have no information about the banana's color when the apple is not red, we cannot definitively conclude that the banana is not yellow. The banana could be yellow or it could be some other color; we simply do not have enough information to make a definitive inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
