However, it does not provide any information about \\( B \\) when \\( C \\) is false.\n\n4. **Given \\( \\neg C \\):**\n   - We know that \\( C \\) is false (the cake was not chocolate). \n\n5. **Analyzing the Implication with \\( \\neg C \\):**\n   - When \\( C \\) is false, the implication \\( C \\rightarrow B \\) does not give us any information about \\( B \\). The truth value of \\( B \\) (whether the muffins were blueberry or not) is independent of the truth value of \\( C \\) when \\( C \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, from the given statements, we cannot infer the truth value of \\( B \\) (whether the muffins were blueberry or not).\n\nAnswer: no",
