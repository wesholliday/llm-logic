In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\nGiven that \\( P \\) (Ben ate pasta) is false, we need to determine the truth value of \\( Q \\) (Kate ate salad).\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true if:\n- \\( P \\) is false (regardless of \\( Q \\)).\n- \\( P \\) is true and \\( Q \\) is true.\n\nSince we know \\( P \\) is false (Ben did not eat pasta), the conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true regardless of whether \\( Q \\) is true or false. Therefore, the truth value of \\( Q \\) (Kate ate salad) is not determined by the given information.\n\nThus, we cannot infer the truth value of \"Kate did not eat salad\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
