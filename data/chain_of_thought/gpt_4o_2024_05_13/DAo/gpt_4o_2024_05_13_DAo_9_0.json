Therefore, \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) does not provide any information about \\( M \\) when \\( L \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( \\neg L \\), we cannot determine the truth value of \\( M \\) because the implication \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) is vacuously true when \\( L \\) is false. Thus, we cannot infer \\( \\neg M \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
