The first statement is: \"The car was not red.\"\n2. The second statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n\nWe need to determine if these statements logically lead to the conclusion: \"The truck was not blue.\"\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n- The first statement tells us that the car is not red.\n- The second statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n\nIn logical terms, the second statement can be written as: \\( \\text{Red(car)} \\rightarrow \\text{Blue(truck)} \\).\n\nSince we know from the first statement that the car is not red (\\( \\neg \\text{Red(car)} \\)), we need to see if this information can help us infer anything about the truck's color.\n\nThe conditional statement \\( \\text{Red(car)} \\rightarrow \\text{Blue(truck)} \\) does not provide any information about the truck's color when the car is not red. The truth of the conditional statement is not affected by the car not being red. In other words, the conditional statement is true regardless of the truck's color when the car is not red.\n\nTherefore, from the information given, we cannot infer anything about the truck's color when the car is not red. Specifically, we cannot infer that the truck is not blue.\n\nAnswer: no",
