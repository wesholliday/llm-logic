            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'Amy did not play tennis' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n   - This means Jeff did not engage in the activity of playing basketball.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if Jeff had played basketball, then it would follow that Amy played tennis. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that the antecedent of the conditional statement in Statement 2 (\"Jeff played basketball\") is false.\n- In logic, a conditional statement (\"If P, then Q\") is considered true if the antecedent (P) is false, regardless of the truth value of the consequent (Q).\n\nGiven that Jeff did not play basketball, the conditional statement does not provide any information about whether Amy played tennis or not. The truth value of \"Amy played tennis\" is independent of the given information because the antecedent of the conditional statement is false.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'Amy did not play tennis' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
