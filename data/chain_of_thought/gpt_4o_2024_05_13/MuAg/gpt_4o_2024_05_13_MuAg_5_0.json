            "content": "Explanation: To determine if we can infer 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for' from 'The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for', we need to analyze the logical structure of both statements.\n\nThe original statement is: 'The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for'. This can be broken down into two parts:\n1. The package must have been delivered today.\n2. The package must have been signed for.\n\nThe inferred statement is: 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for'. This statement combines the two conditions into a single conjunction.\n\nSince both parts of the original statement are present in the inferred statement, and the conjunction 'and' is used in both cases to link the two conditions, the inferred statement logically follows from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The package must have been delivered today and signed for' from 'The package must have been delivered today and it must have been signed for'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
