            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed and it must have been notarized\" consists of two separate conditions that both need to be true: the document must have been signed, and the document must have been notarized. When we rephrase this to \"The document must have been signed and notarized,\" we are combining these two conditions into a single statement. The meaning remains the same because both conditions are still required to be true. Therefore, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
