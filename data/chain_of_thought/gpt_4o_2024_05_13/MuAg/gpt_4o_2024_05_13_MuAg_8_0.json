The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays.\n2.

The restaurant must have served Italian cuisine.\n\nThe conjunction \"and\" in the inferred statement also indicates that both conditions are true simultaneously.\n\nSince both the original and inferred statements convey the same two conditions connected by \"and,\" we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
