This statement has two parts:\n1. The application must have been completed online.\n2. The application must have included references.\n\nBoth parts are connected by 'and', indicating that both conditions are required.\n\nThe inferred statement is: 'The application must have been completed online and included references'. This statement also has two parts:\n1. The application must have been completed online.\n2. The application must have included references.\n\nBoth parts are connected by 'and', indicating that both conditions are required.\n\nSince both statements convey the same two conditions and the conjunction 'and' indicates that both conditions must be met, we can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes",
