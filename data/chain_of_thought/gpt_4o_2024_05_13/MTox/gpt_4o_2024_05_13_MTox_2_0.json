The first statement is: \"The wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acB (where B represents \"the wug bimmed the zoint\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n   - This can be written as: F \u2192 B (where F represents \"the wug was flooped\").\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acF (the wug was not flooped) from these statements.\n\n3. We know from the first statement that \u00acB is true.\n   - \u00acB means \"the wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\n4. From the second statement, we have the implication F \u2192 B.\n   - This means \"if the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\n5. In logic, if F \u2192 B and \u00acB are both true, we can infer \u00acF.\n   - This is because if F were true, then B would have to be true (according to the implication F \u2192 B). However, since we know \u00acB is true (B is false), F cannot be true. Therefore, \u00acF must be true.\n\nThus, from the given statements, we can infer that the wug was not flooped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
