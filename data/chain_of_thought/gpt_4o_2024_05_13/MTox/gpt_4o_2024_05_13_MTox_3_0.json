The contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P,\" and it is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of M \u2192 Q is:\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acM\n\nWe know from the first statement that \u00acQ is true (the splat did not quank). Given \u00acQ, and using the contrapositive \u00acQ \u2192 \u00acM, we can infer that \u00acM is true (the splat was not morphed).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The splat was not morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
