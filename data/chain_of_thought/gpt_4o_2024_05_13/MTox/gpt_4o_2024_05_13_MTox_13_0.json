It tells us that if the glip was slogged, then it must have been tragged as well.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to see if we can infer \"The glip was not slogged.\"\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that the glip was not tragged.\n- According to Statement 2, if the glip had been slogged, it would have been tragged.\n- Since we know from Statement 1 that the glip was not tragged, it must be the case that the glip was not slogged. If the glip had been slogged, it would contradict Statement 1 because it would imply that the glip was tragged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
