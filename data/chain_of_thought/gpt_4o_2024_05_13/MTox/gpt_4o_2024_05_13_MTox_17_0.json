The first statement is: \"The flob did not movated.\"\n   - This means that the flob did not perform the action of movating.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the flob was skizzled, then it would have movated.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer 'The flob was not skizzled' from these statements.\n\nLet's use logical reasoning:\n\n- According to the second statement, if the flob was skizzled, then it would have movated.\n- However, the first statement tells us that the flob did not movate.\n\nGiven that the flob did not movate, the condition in the second statement (that the flob was skizzled) cannot be true. If the flob had been skizzled, it would have movated, but since it did not movate, it must not have been skizzled.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
