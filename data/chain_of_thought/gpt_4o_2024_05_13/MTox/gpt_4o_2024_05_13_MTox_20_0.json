It tells us that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it would have surned.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that the fleeg did not surn.\n- According to Statement 2, if the fleeg had been bluttered, it would have surned.\n\nSince the fleeg did not surn, the condition in Statement 2 (that the fleeg was bluttered) must not have been met. Therefore, we can infer that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: yes",
