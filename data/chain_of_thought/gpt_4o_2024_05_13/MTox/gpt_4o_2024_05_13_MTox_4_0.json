            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The fribble was not snurgled' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"The fribble did not crink.\"\n   - This means that the fribble did not perform the action of crinking.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer 'The fribble was not snurgled' from these statements.\n\nLet's use logical reasoning:\n\n- According to the second statement, if the fribble was snurgled, then it would have crinked.\n- However, the first statement tells us that the fribble did not crink.\n\nGiven that the fribble did not crink, the condition in the second statement (that the fribble was snurgled) cannot be true. If the fribble had been snurgled, it would have crinked, but since it did not crink, it must not have been snurgled.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
