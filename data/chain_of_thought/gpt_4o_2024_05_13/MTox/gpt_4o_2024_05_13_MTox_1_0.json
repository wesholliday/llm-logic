It tells us that if the flugel was blimmed, then it must have been zargled.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to see if we can infer 'The flugel was not blimmed.'\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that the flugel was not zargled.\n- According to Statement 2, if the flugel had been blimmed, it would have been zargled.\n- Since we know from Statement 1 that the flugel was not zargled, it contradicts the condition in Statement 2 that being blimmed would result in being zargled.\n\nTherefore, if the flugel had been blimmed, it would have been zargled, but since it was not zargled, it must not have been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
