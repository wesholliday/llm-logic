It tells us that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements to see if we can infer 'The flug was not blummed':\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that the flug was not zimmed.\n- According to Statement 2, if the flug had been blummed, it would have been zimmed.\n- Since we know from Statement 1 that the flug was not zimmed, it contradicts the condition in Statement 2 that blumming the flug would result in it being zimmed.\n\nTherefore, if the flug had been blummed, it would have been zimmed, but since it was not zimmed, it must not have been blummed.\n\nAnswer: yes",
