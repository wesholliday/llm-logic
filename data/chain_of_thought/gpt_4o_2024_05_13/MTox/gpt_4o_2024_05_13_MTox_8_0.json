It tells us that cranking the sprocket implies that the sprocket would be daggled.\n\nTo infer whether the sprocket was cranked or not, we need to consider the logical implications of these statements together.\n\n- From Statement 2, we know that if the sprocket was cranked, it must be daggled.\n- From Statement 1, we know that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\nGiven that the sprocket was not daggled, it contradicts the condition that cranking the sprocket would result in it being daggled. Therefore, the sprocket could not have been cranked, because if it were cranked, it would have to be daggled, which it is not.\n\nThus, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
