            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"The sneg did not sproted the frink.\"\n   - This tells us that the sneg did not perform the action of sproting the frink.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the sneg was crampled, then it would have sproted the frink.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer 'The sneg was not crampled' from these statements.\n\nLet's use logical reasoning:\n\n- According to the first statement, the sneg did not sproted the frink.\n- According to the second statement, if the sneg was crampled, then it would have sproted the frink.\n\nSince the sneg did not sproted the frink, the condition in the second statement (the sneg was crampled) must be false. If the sneg had been crampled, it would have sproted the frink, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
