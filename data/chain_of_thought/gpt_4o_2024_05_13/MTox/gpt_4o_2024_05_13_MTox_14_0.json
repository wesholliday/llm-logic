It means that if the clug was fleeked, then it would have snugged.\n\nNow, let's combine these statements:\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that the clug did not snug.\n- According to Statement 2, if the clug had been fleeked, it would have snugged.\n\nSince the clug did not snug (Statement 1), it contradicts the outcome of the conditional statement (Statement 2) if the clug were fleeked. Therefore, the clug could not have been fleeked; otherwise, it would have snugged.\n\nThus, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
