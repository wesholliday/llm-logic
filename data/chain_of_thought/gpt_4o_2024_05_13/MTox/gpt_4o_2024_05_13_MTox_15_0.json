            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The dreb was not vroombed' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"The dreb was not spened.\"\n   - This means that the condition of the dreb being spened is false.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. In logical terms, it can be written as: If P, then Q (P \u2192 Q), where P is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and Q is \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\nGiven these two statements, we need to determine if we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\n3. Let's use the contrapositive of the conditional statement to help us:\n   - The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).\n   - Applying this to our conditional statement: If the dreb was not spened (\u00acQ), then the dreb was not vroombed (\u00acP).\n\n4. From the first statement, we know that \"The dreb was not spened\" (\u00acQ).\n\n5. Using the contrapositive of the conditional statement, we can now infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed\" (\u00acP).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that \"The dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
