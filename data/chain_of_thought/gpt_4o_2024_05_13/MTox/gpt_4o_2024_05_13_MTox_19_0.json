It tells us that if the smonk was vreebled, then it necessarily follows that the smonk plagged.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer 'The smonk was not vreebled' from these statements.\n\n3. **Logical Analysis:**\n   - From Statement 2, we know that vreebling the smonk implies that the smonk would have plagged.\n   - From Statement 1, we know that the smonk did not plagged.\n\n4. **Combining the Information:**\n   - If the smonk had been vreebled, then according to Statement 2, the smonk would have plagged.\n   - However, Statement 1 tells us that the smonk did not plagged.\n   - Therefore, it must be the case that the smonk was not vreebled. If the smonk had been vreebled, it would contradict Statement 1.\n\nThus, based on the given statements, we can logically infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
