It tells us that if the shank was plooked, it must also be nugged.\n\nNow, let's use these statements to see if we can infer 'The shank was not plooked.'\n\n- According to Statement 2, if the shank was plooked, it would have to be nugged.\n- However, Statement 1 tells us that the shank was not nugged.\n\nGiven that the shank was not nugged, the condition in Statement 2 cannot be true if the shank was plooked. Therefore, the shank cannot be plooked because if it were, it would contradict the fact that the shank was not nugged.\n\nThus, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
