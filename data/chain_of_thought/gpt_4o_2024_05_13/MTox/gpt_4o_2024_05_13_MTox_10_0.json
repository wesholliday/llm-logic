            "content": "To determine whether we can infer 'The wug was not sproinged' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"The wug was not garpled.\"\n   - This means that the wug did not undergo the action or state of being garpled.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. In logical terms, it can be written as: If P (the wug was sproinged), then Q (the wug was garpled).\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer 'The wug was not sproinged' (\u00acP) from these statements.\n\n3. According to the first statement, the wug was not garpled (\u00acQ).\n\n4. From the second statement, we know that if the wug was sproinged (P), then it must have been garpled (Q).\n\n5. Given that the wug was not garpled (\u00acQ), we can use the contrapositive of the second statement. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\" (\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP).\n\n6. Since we know \u00acQ (the wug was not garpled), we can apply the contrapositive to infer \u00acP (the wug was not sproinged).\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
