It tells us that plinking the twonk implies that the twonk was varnished. In logical terms, this can be written as:\n     - If P (the twonk was plinked), then Q (the twonk was varnished).\n\nNow, let's use these statements to see if we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\n- From Statement 1, we know that Q (the twonk was varnished) is false.\n- From Statement 2, we have the conditional statement: If P, then Q.\n\nIn logic, if a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is true and Q is false, then P must also be false. This is because if P were true, Q would have to be true as well, which contradicts our information that Q is false.\n\nTherefore, since Q is false (the twonk was not varnished), P (the twonk was plinked) must also be false.\n\nThus, we can infer that the twonk was not plinked.\n\nAnswer: no",
