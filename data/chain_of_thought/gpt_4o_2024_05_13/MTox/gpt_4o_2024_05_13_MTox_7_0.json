The first statement is: \"The whiffle did not tink.\"\n   - This can be written as: \u00acT (where T represents \"the whiffle tinked\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n   - This can be written as: S \u2192 T (where S represents \"the whiffle was shanked\").\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \u00acS (the whiffle was not shanked) from these statements.\n\nLet's use logical reasoning:\n\n- We know \u00acT (the whiffle did not tink).\n- We also know S \u2192 T (if the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked).\n\nIn logical terms, if S were true, then T would have to be true because of the implication S \u2192 T. However, we know that T is false (\u00acT). \n\nIn logic, if an implication S \u2192 T is true and the consequent (T) is false, then the antecedent (S) must also be false. This is because the only way for an implication to be true when the consequent is false is if the antecedent is also false.\n\nTherefore, given \u00acT and S \u2192 T, we can infer \u00acS.\n\nAnswer: yes",
