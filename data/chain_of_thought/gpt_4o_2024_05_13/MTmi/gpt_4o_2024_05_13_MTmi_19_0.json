            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"Tom did not watch football\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Jen might not have watched basketball.\" This implies that it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball. In logical terms, this means:\n   - \\( \\neg J \\) is possible (where \\( \\neg J \\) represents \"Jen did not watch basketball\").\n\nTo infer \"Tom did not watch football\" (\\( \\neg T \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n3. From the first statement (\\( T \\rightarrow J \\)), we know that if \\( T \\) is true, then \\( J \\) must be true. In other words, if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n\n4. The second statement tells us that it is possible that \\( J \\) is not true (\\( \\neg J \\) is possible). If \\( J \\) is not true, then \\( T \\) cannot be true because \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) would be violated. Therefore, if \\( \\neg J \\) is possible, \\( T \\) must be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nThus, if it is possible that Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom could not have watched football. This leads us to conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
