It can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow P \\), where \\( S \\) represents \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( P \\) represents \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. **Statement 2: \"Bob might not have chosen pasta.\"**\n   - This statement indicates that it is possible that Bob did not choose pasta. In logical terms, this means \\( \\neg P \\) (not P) is possible.\n\n3. **Inference: \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"**\n   - We need to determine if \\( \\neg S \\) (not S) can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nLet's analyze the logical implications:\n\n- From \\( S \\rightarrow P \\), we know that if Sue chose pizza (S), then Bob must have chosen pasta (P).\n- If it is possible that Bob did not choose pasta (\\( \\neg P \\)), then the condition \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) would be violated if Sue had chosen pizza. This is because if Sue chose pizza (S), Bob must have chosen pasta (P), but we are given that Bob might not have chosen pasta (\\( \\neg P \\)).\n\nTherefore, for the conditional statement \\( S \\rightarrow P \\) to hold true while considering the possibility of \\( \\neg P \\), it must be the case that Sue did not choose pizza (\\( \\neg S \\)).\n\nThus, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes",
