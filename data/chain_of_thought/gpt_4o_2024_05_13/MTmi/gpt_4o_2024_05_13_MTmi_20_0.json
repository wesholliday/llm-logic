            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), where \\( A \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The banana might not have been yellow.\"\n   - This statement suggests that it is possible that the banana was not yellow. In logical terms, this means \\( \\neg B \\) is possible (where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"the banana was not yellow\").\n\nTo infer 'The apple was not red' (which is \\( \\neg A \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From Statement 1 (\\( A \\rightarrow B \\)), we know that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must be true.\n- Statement 2 tells us that \\( B \\) might not be true (\\( \\neg B \\) is possible).\n\nIf \\( \\neg B \\) is possible, then \\( B \\) is not necessarily true. According to the contrapositive of the conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), if \\( B \\) is not true (\\( \\neg B \\)), then \\( A \\) cannot be true (\\( \\neg A \\)). \n\nSince Statement 2 allows for the possibility that \\( B \\) is not true, it implies that \\( A \\) cannot be true in that scenario. Therefore, we can infer \\( \\neg A \\) (the apple was not red).\n\nAnswer: yes",
