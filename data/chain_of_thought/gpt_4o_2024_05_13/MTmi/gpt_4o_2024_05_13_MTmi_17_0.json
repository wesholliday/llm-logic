            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'Ben did not eat pasta' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate must have eaten salad.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( B \\rightarrow K \\), where \\( B \\) represents \"Ben ate pasta\" and \\( K \\) represents \"Kate ate salad.\"\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Kate might not have eaten salad.\"\n   - This statement suggests that it is possible that Kate did not eat salad. In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( \\neg K \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer 'Ben did not eat pasta' (i.e., \\( \\neg B \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From the conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow K \\), we know that if \\( B \\) is true, then \\( K \\) must be true.\n- The second statement tells us that \\( K \\) might not be true (i.e., \\( \\neg K \\) is possible).\n\nIf \\( K \\) is not true (i.e., \\( \\neg K \\)), then according to the contrapositive of the conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow K \\), \\( B \\) cannot be true. The contrapositive of \\( B \\rightarrow K \\) is \\( \\neg K \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n\nSince \\( \\neg K \\) is possible, it implies that \\( \\neg B \\) must be true if \\( \\neg K \\) is indeed the case.\n\nTherefore, given that it is possible that Kate did not eat salad, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes",
