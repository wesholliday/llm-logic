The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow L \\)\n   - Where \\( J \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( L \\) represents \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n   - In logical terms, this means \\( \\neg L \\) (not \\( L \\)) is possible.\n\nTo infer 'Joe did not go to the park' (\\( \\neg J \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From the first statement \\( J \\rightarrow L \\), we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n- The second statement suggests that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo, which means \\( L \\) is not necessarily true.\n\nIf \\( L \\) is not necessarily true, then \\( J \\) cannot be true because if \\( J \\) were true, \\( L \\) would have to be true (according to the first statement). Therefore, the possibility that \\( L \\) is not true implies that \\( J \\) must be false.\n\nThus, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
