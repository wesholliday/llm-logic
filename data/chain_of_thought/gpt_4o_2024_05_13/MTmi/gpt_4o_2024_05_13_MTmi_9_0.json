In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n     - Where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n     - And \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - This indicates that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( \\neg M \\) is possible.\n     - Where \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nTo infer 'Lisa did not buy the red shirt' (which is \\( \\neg L \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From Statement 1 (\\( L \\rightarrow M \\)), we know that if \\( L \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true.\n- From Statement 2, we know that \\( M \\) might not be true (\\( \\neg M \\) is possible).\n\nIf \\( \\neg M \\) is possible, then \\( M \\) is not necessarily true. For \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) to hold, if \\( L \\) were true, \\( M \\) would have to be true. Since \\( M \\) might not be true, \\( L \\) cannot be true because it would violate the conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\).\n\nTherefore, if \\( M \\) is not necessarily true, \\( L \\) must be false to satisfy the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
