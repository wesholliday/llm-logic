The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow E \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( E \\) represents \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Erin might not have taken a train.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that Erin did not take a train.\n   - In logical terms, this means \\( \\neg E \\) (not \\( E \\)) is possible.\n\nTo infer 'Sam did not take a plane' (\\( \\neg S \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From the first statement \\( S \\rightarrow E \\), we know that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( E \\) must be true.\n- The second statement suggests that \\( E \\) might not be true (\\( \\neg E \\) is possible).\n\nIf \\( E \\) is not true (\\( \\neg E \\)), then \\( S \\) cannot be true because \\( S \\rightarrow E \\) would be violated. Therefore, if there is a possibility that \\( E \\) is not true, then \\( S \\) must be false to maintain the truth of the conditional statement.\n\nThus, from the possibility that Erin did not take a train, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes",
