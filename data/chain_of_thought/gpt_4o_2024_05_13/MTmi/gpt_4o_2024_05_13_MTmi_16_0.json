            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The shirt was not cotton\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( \\text{Shirt is cotton} \\rightarrow \\text{Pants are denim} \\).\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The pants might not have been denim.\"\n   - This indicates that it is possible that the pants were not denim. In logical terms, this can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg (\\text{Pants are denim}) \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer \"The shirt was not cotton,\" we need to see if the negation of the conclusion (pants are denim) affects the truth of the premise (shirt is cotton).\n\n3. **Contrapositive of Statement 1:**\n   - The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( p \\rightarrow q \\) is \\( \\neg q \\rightarrow \\neg p \\).\n   - Applying this to our statement: \\( \\neg (\\text{Pants are denim}) \\rightarrow \\neg (\\text{Shirt is cotton}) \\).\n\n4. **Using Statement 2:**\n   - Statement 2 suggests that \\( \\neg (\\text{Pants are denim}) \\) is possible.\n   - If \\( \\neg (\\text{Pants are denim}) \\) is true, then by the contrapositive of Statement 1, \\( \\neg (\\text{Shirt is cotton}) \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, if the pants might not have been denim, it implies that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes",
