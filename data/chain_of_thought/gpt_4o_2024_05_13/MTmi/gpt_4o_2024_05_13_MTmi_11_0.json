            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( C \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( C \\) represents \"The cake was chocolate\" and \\( B \\) represents \"The muffins were blueberry.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The muffins might not have been blueberry.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that the muffins were not blueberry.\n   - In logical terms, this means \\( \\neg B \\) (not \\( B \\)) is possible.\n\nTo infer \"The cake was not chocolate\" (\\( \\neg C \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n3. From the first statement \\( C \\rightarrow B \\), we know that if \\( C \\) is true, then \\( B \\) must be true.\n   - If \\( B \\) is not true (\\( \\neg B \\)), then \\( C \\) cannot be true because it would violate the conditional statement \\( C \\rightarrow B \\).\n\n4. The second statement tells us that \\( \\neg B \\) is possible. If \\( \\neg B \\) is possible, then \\( C \\) cannot be true because \\( C \\) being true would necessitate \\( B \\) being true.\n\nTherefore, the possibility of \\( \\neg B \\) implies that \\( C \\) cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
