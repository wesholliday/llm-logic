In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Chris might not have finished the race.\"\n   - This statement indicates that it is possible that Chris did not finish the race. In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( \\neg C \\) is possible.\n   - Where \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"Chris did not finish the race.\"\n\nTo infer \"Alex did not finish the race\" (\\( \\neg A \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From Statement 1 (\\( A \\rightarrow C \\)), we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n- From Statement 2, we know that it is possible that Chris did not finish the race (\\( \\neg C \\) is possible).\n\nIf \\( \\neg C \\) (Chris did not finish the race) is possible, then according to the conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), Alex could not have finished the race. This is because if Alex had finished the race, Chris must have finished the race, which contradicts the possibility that Chris did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, the possibility that Chris did not finish the race implies that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes",
