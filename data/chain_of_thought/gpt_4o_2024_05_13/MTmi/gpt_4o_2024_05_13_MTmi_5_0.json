The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   - Where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Amy might not have played tennis.\"\n   - This means that it is possible that Amy did not play tennis.\n   - In logical terms, this can be interpreted as: \\( \\neg A \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer \"Jeff did not play basketball\" (\\( \\neg J \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n3. Let's consider the contrapositive of the first statement:\n   - The contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\).\n   - This means: \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\n4. The second statement tells us that \\( \\neg A \\) (Amy did not play tennis) is possible. However, it does not definitively state that \\( \\neg A \\) is true; it only suggests that it might be true.\n\n5. For us to definitively conclude \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball), we would need to know for certain that \\( \\neg A \\) (Amy did not play tennis) is true. Since the second statement only indicates that \\( \\neg A \\) is possible and not certain, we cannot definitively conclude \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that \"Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
