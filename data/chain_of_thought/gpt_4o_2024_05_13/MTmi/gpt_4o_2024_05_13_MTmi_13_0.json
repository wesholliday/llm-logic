            "content": "To determine if we can infer 'The car was not red' from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\text{Car is red} \\rightarrow \\text{Truck is blue} \\).\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck might not have been blue.\"\n   - This implies that it is possible that the truck was not blue. In logical terms, this means that the truck being blue is not a certainty.\n\nTo infer 'The car was not red', we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- According to the first statement, if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n- The second statement suggests that the truck being blue is not certain (it might not have been blue).\n\nIf the truck might not have been blue, then the condition set by the first statement (that the truck must be blue if the car is red) would be violated if the car were red. Therefore, for the second statement to hold true, the car cannot be red. \n\nThus, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
