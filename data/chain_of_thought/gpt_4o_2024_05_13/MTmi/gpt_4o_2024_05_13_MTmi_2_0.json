In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n   - Where \\( G \\) represents \"The griffin was in the forest\" and \\( U \\) represents \"The unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\"\n   - This statement indicates that it is possible that the unicorn was not in the forest. In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( \\neg U \\) is possible.\n   - This means that \\( U \\) is not necessarily true; it could be false.\n\nTo infer \"The griffin was not in the forest\" (\\( \\neg G \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From Statement 1 (\\( G \\rightarrow U \\)), we know that if \\( G \\) is true, then \\( U \\) must be true.\n- From Statement 2, we know that \\( U \\) might not be true (\\( \\neg U \\) is possible).\n\nIf \\( U \\) is not true (\\( \\neg U \\)), then according to the contrapositive of the conditional statement (\\( G \\rightarrow U \\)), \\( G \\) cannot be true. The contrapositive of \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) is \\( \\neg U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\).\n\nSince \\( \\neg U \\) is possible, and if \\( \\neg U \\) were true, then \\( \\neg G \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, given that \\( U \\) might not be true, it follows that \\( G \\) cannot be true if \\( U \\) is indeed not true.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The griffin was not in the forest.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
