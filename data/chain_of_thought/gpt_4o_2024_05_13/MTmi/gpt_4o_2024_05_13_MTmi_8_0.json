This is because if the mummy was not awake, the vampire could not have been awake, otherwise, it would contradict the first statement.\n\n4. **Considering the possibility:**\n   - Since it is possible that \\( \\neg M \\) (the mummy was not awake), we can consider the scenario where \\( \\neg M \\) is true.\n   - If \\( \\neg M \\) is true, then \\( \\neg V \\) must also be true to satisfy the first statement.\n\nTherefore, given that it is possible for the mummy to not have been awake, we can infer that the vampire was not awake to avoid any contradiction with the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
