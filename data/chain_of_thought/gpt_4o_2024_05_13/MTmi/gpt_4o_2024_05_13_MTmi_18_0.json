            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step.\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     - \\( P \\): The doll was plastic.\n     - \\( Q \\): The truck was metal.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The truck might not have been metal.\"\n   - This indicates that it is possible that the truck was not metal. In logical terms, this can be written as: \\( \\neg Q \\) is possible.\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg P \\) (The doll was not plastic) from these statements.\n\n3. **Analyzing the conditional statement:**\n   - The conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) means that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n   - The contrapositive of this statement is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), which means if \\( Q \\) is false, then \\( P \\) must be false.\n\n4. **Considering the possibility:**\n   - Statement 2 says that \\( Q \\) (The truck was metal) might not be true, i.e., \\( \\neg Q \\) is possible.\n   - If \\( \\neg Q \\) is possible, then according to the contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\), \\( \\neg P \\) (The doll was not plastic) must be true whenever \\( \\neg Q \\) is true.\n\nSince \\( \\neg Q \\) is possible, and whenever \\( \\neg Q \\) is true, \\( \\neg P \\) must be true, we can infer that \\( \\neg P \\) (The doll was not plastic) is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes",
