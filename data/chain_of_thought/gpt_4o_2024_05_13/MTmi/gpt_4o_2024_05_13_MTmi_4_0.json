In logical terms, this means \\( \\neg R \\) is possible.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- From \\( A \\rightarrow R \\), if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( R \\) must be true.\n- If \\( R \\) is false (or might be false), then \\( A \\) cannot be true because it would contradict the implication \\( A \\rightarrow R \\).\n\nTherefore, if it is possible that \\( R \\) is false, then \\( A \\) must be false to maintain the truth of the implication \\( A \\rightarrow R \\).\n\nThus, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes",
