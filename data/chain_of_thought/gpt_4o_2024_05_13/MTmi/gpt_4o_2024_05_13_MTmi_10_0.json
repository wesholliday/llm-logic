In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n     - Where \\( D \\) represents \"The dog was inside.\"\n     - And \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"The cat was outside.\"\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The cat might not have been outside.\"\n   - This means it is possible that the cat was not outside. In logical terms, it can be written as: \\( \\neg C \\) is possible.\n\nTo infer 'The dog was not inside' (which is \\( \\neg D \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From Statement 1 (\\( D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)), we know that if \\( D \\) is true, then \\( \\neg C \\) must be true.\n- Statement 2 tells us that \\( \\neg C \\) is possible, but it does not definitively state that \\( \\neg C \\) is true. It only suggests that \\( \\neg C \\) might be true.\n\nTo infer \\( \\neg D \\) (the dog was not inside), we need to show that \\( D \\) leads to a contradiction with the given information. However, since Statement 2 only indicates a possibility and not a certainty, it does not provide a definitive contradiction to \\( D \\).\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer \\( \\neg D \\) from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
