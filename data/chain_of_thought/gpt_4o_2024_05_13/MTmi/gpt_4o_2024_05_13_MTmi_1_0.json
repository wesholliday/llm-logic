            "content": "To determine if we can infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" from the given statements, let's analyze them step by step:\n\n1. **Statement 1:** \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This is a conditional statement. It can be written as: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\), where \\( M \\) represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and \\( S \\) represents \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This indicates that it is possible that Sue was not at the wedding. In logical terms, this means \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding) is possible.\n\nTo infer \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (\\( \\neg M \\)), we need to see if the given statements logically lead to this conclusion.\n\n- From Statement 1 (\\( M \\rightarrow S \\)), we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there.\n- Statement 2 (\\( \\neg S \\) is possible) suggests that Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\nIf Sue was not at the wedding (\\( \\neg S \\)), then according to the contrapositive of Statement 1, Mary could not have been at the wedding. The contrapositive of \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\nSince \\( \\neg S \\) (Sue was not at the wedding) is possible, it follows that \\( \\neg M \\) (Mary was not at the wedding) must be true if \\( \\neg S \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, given that Sue might not have been at the wedding, it is consistent with the statements to infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes",
