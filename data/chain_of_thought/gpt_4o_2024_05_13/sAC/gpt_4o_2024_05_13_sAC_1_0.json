            "content": "To determine whether 'Mary was at the wedding' is true, we need to analyze the given statements logically.\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written as:\n   - If M, then S (where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\").\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Sue was at the wedding.\" This can be written as:\n   - S is true.\n\nWe need to determine if M (Mary was at the wedding) is true based on these statements.\n\nThe conditional statement \"If M, then S\" tells us that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding. However, it does not provide any information about what happens if Sue was at the wedding. The truth of S (Sue was at the wedding) does not necessarily imply the truth of M (Mary was at the wedding). \n\nIn logical terms, the truth of the consequent (S) does not guarantee the truth of the antecedent (M) in a conditional statement. Therefore, knowing that Sue was at the wedding does not allow us to conclude that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no",
