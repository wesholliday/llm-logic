The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"The doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The truck was metal.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( Q \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if \\( P \\) (\"The doll was plastic\") is true based on the given information.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not provide information about the truth value of \\( P \\) if \\( Q \\) is true. The truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not imply the truth of \\( P \\). The conditional statement only tells us that if \\( P \\) were true, then \\( Q \\) would necessarily be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not necessarily mean that \\( P \\) is true; \\( Q \\) could be true for other reasons unrelated to \\( P \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \"The doll was plastic\" is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
