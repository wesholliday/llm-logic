The first statement is a conditional: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This can be written as \\( A \\rightarrow C \\), where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\" and \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Chris finished the race.\" This can be written as \\( C \\).\n\nWe need to determine if \\( A \\) (Alex finished the race) is true based on these statements.\n\n- The conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) tells us that if \\( A \\) is true, then \\( C \\) must be true.\n- The statement \\( C \\) is true tells us that Chris did indeed finish the race.\n\nHowever, the truth of \\( C \\) alone does not provide information about \\( A \\). The conditional \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) does not imply that \\( A \\) must be true if \\( C \\) is true. It only tells us what happens if \\( A \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( A \\) (Alex finished the race) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
