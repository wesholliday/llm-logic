The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n   where \\( B \\) represents \"The bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"The wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The wolf was in the den.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( W \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if \\( B \\) (The bear was in the cave) is true based on the given information.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) means that if \\( B \\) is true, then \\( W \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( B \\) if \\( W \\) is true. The truth of \\( W \\) alone does not imply the truth of \\( B \\); \\( W \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( B \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( B \\) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
