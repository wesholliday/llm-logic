The first statement is a conditional: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written as: \n   - If G, then U (G \u2192 U)\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The unicorn was in the forest.\" This can be written as:\n   - U\n\nWe need to determine if 'The griffin was in the forest' (G) follows from these statements.\n\n- The conditional statement (G \u2192 U) tells us that if G is true, then U must be true.\n- The second statement (U) tells us that U is true.\n\nHowever, the truth of U does not necessarily imply the truth of G. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if G is true, not that G must be true if U is true. U being true could be the case regardless of whether G is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that G is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
