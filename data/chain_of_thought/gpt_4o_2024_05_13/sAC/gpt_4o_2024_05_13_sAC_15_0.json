The first statement is a conditional: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Erin took a train.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Sam took a plane) is true given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\). The conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not provide any information about \\( P \\) on its own. \\( Q \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( P \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( P \\) (Sam took a plane) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
