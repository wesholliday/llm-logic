The first statement is a conditional: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\), where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Lucy went to the zoo.\" This can be written as: \\( Q \\).\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park) is true given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\). The conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not provide any information about \\( P \\) on its own. \\( Q \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( P \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( P \\) (Joe went to the park) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
