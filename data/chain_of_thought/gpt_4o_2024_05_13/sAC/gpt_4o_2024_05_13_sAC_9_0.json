The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n   where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( M \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( L \\) (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true given \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( M \\).\n\nIn logic, the truth of \\( M \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( L \\). The conditional statement \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) only tells us that if \\( L \\) is true, then \\( M \\) must be true. However, \\( M \\) being true does not provide any information about the truth value of \\( L \\). \\( M \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( L \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that \\( L \\) is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
