The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - If A, then B (A \u2192 B)\n   - Where A is \"The apple was red\" and B is \"The banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The banana was yellow.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - B is true.\n\nWe need to determine if A (The apple was red) is true based on these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement (A \u2192 B) does not provide information about the truth value of A if B is true. The truth of B does not necessarily imply the truth of A. The conditional statement only tells us that if A were true, then B would be true. However, B being true does not mean that A must be true; A could be either true or false.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude that 'The apple was red' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
