The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   - \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n   where \\( D \\) represents \"The dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"The cat was outside.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cat was outside.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( C \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( D \\) (The dog was inside) is true based on the given information.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) does not provide information about the truth value of \\( D \\) if \\( C \\) is true. The truth of \\( C \\) (the cat being outside) does not necessarily imply that \\( D \\) (the dog being inside) is true. The cat being outside could be true regardless of whether the dog was inside or not.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that 'The dog was inside' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
