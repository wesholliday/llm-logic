The first statement is a conditional: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"Sue chose pizza\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Bob chose pasta.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Bob chose pasta.\" This can be written as:\n   - \\( Q \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( P \\) (Sue chose pizza) is true given \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the truth of \\( Q \\) alone does not necessarily imply the truth of \\( P \\). The conditional \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) only tells us that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must be true. However, \\( Q \\) being true does not provide information about \\( P \\)'s truth value. \\( Q \\) could be true regardless of whether \\( P \\) is true or false.\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we cannot conclude that 'Sue chose pizza' is true.\n\nAnswer: no",
