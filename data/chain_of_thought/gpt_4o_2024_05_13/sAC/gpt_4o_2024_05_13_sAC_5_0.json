The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Amy played tennis.\" This can be written as:\n   \\( A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( J \\) (Jeff played basketball) is true based on these statements.\n\nIn logic, a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) means that if \\( J \\) is true, then \\( A \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide information about the truth value of \\( J \\) if \\( A \\) is true. The truth of \\( A \\) alone does not imply the truth of \\( J \\); it only confirms that if \\( J \\) were true, \\( A \\) would be true as well.\n\nTherefore, knowing that \\( A \\) is true does not allow us to conclude that \\( J \\) is true. \\( J \\) could be either true or false independently of \\( A \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
