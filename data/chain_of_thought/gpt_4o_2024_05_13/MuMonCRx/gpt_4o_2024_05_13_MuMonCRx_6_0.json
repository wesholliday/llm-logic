The crunk must be zibble snizzle.\n2. The crunk must be flimble at snorkel zibble.\n\nThe use of 'and' indicates that both conditions must be true simultaneously. Therefore, the second part of the original statement directly states 'The crunk must be flimble at snorkel zibble'.\n\nSince the second part of the original statement is exactly what we are trying to infer, it logically follows that we can infer 'The crunk must be flimble at snorkel zibble' from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
