'The floob must be shimble on flimble'\n2. 'The floob must be wumble quorple zibber'\n\nThe conjunction 'and' indicates that both conditions must be true simultaneously. However, each part of the statement stands as an independent requirement for the floob.\n\nThe second part of the original statement, 'The floob must be wumble quorple zibber', is exactly the same as the statement we are trying to infer.\n\nSince the second part of the original statement is identical to the statement we are trying to infer, we can directly conclude that 'The floob must be wumble quorple zibber' is indeed a part of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
