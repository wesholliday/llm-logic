This statement lists multiple conditions or attributes that the quank must satisfy. Specifically, it mentions that the quank must be:\n1. frazzle\n2. crunk wozzle\n3. crunk a wump\n\nThe phrase 'crunk a wump' is explicitly mentioned as one of the conditions that the quank must satisfy. Therefore, it is directly stated in the original statement.\n\nSince 'crunk a wump' is one of the conditions listed, we can infer that 'The quank must be crunk a wump' is true based on the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes",
