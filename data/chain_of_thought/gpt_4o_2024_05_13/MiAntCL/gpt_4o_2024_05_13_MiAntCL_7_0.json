However, it does not provide any information about the content or scope of the exam, such as whether it will cover all chapters. To infer that the exam might be difficult and cover all chapters, we would need additional information that specifically mentions the coverage of all chapters. Since the original statement only addresses the potential difficulty and not the content, we cannot make that inference.\n\nAnswer: no",
