However, it does not provide any information about whether fresh towels are provided. The addition of fresh towels is an extra detail that is not mentioned or implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer that fresh towels are provided based solely on the information given about the room being cleaned daily.\n\nAnswer: no",
