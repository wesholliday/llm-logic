            "content": "Explanation: The statement \"The document might be signed\" indicates a possibility that the document could be signed, but it does not provide any information about notarization. Notarization is a separate process that involves a notary public verifying the identity of the signers and witnessing the signing of the document. Since the original statement only mentions the possibility of the document being signed and does not mention notarization at all, we cannot infer that the document might be both signed and notarized. The additional condition of notarization is not implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
