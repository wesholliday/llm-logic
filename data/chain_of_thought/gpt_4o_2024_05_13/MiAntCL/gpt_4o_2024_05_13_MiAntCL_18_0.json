However, it does not provide any information about the frequency of taking the medicine. The phrase \"and be taken twice daily\" introduces a new condition that is not mentioned or implied in the original statement. Therefore, we cannot infer from the original statement that the medicine should be taken twice daily.\n\nAnswer: no",
