The original statement is: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and \\( B \\) is \"the dreb was spened.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow A \\)\n\nIn logic, \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) does not imply \\( B \\rightarrow A \\). The original statement only tells us that if \\( A \\) happens, then \\( B \\) happens. It does not provide any information about what happens if \\( B \\) happens.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( B \\rightarrow A \\) from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
