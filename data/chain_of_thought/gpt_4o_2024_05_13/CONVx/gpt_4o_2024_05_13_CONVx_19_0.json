The original statement is 'If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged'. This can be written in logical terms as:\n   - \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   where \\( A \\) is 'the smonk was vreebled' and \\( B \\) is 'the smonk plagged'.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is 'If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled'. This can be written in logical terms as:\n   - \\( B \\rightarrow A \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) does not necessarily imply \\( B \\rightarrow A \\). The original statement only tells us that if \\( A \\) happens, then \\( B \\) will happen. It does not tell us that if \\( B \\) happens, then \\( A \\) must have happened.\n\n4. To infer \\( B \\rightarrow A \\) from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), we would need additional information that establishes a bidirectional relationship, such as \\( A \\leftrightarrow B \\) (if and only if).\n\nSince we do not have such information, we cannot infer \\( B \\rightarrow A \\) from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
