The original statement is: 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint'.\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( F \\rightarrow B \\), where \\( F \\) represents 'the wug was flooped' and \\( B \\) represents 'the wug bimmed the zoint'.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: 'If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was flooped'.\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( B \\rightarrow F \\).\n\n3. In logic, \\( F \\rightarrow B \\) does not necessarily imply \\( B \\rightarrow F \\). The original statement is a conditional statement, and its converse (reversing the direction of the implication) is not automatically true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was flooped' from 'If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: no",
