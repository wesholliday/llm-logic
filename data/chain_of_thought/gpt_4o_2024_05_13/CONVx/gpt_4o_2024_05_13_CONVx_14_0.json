The original statement is: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the clug was fleeked\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the clug snugged.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was fleeked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\)\n\nIn logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not imply \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). The latter is known as the converse of the former, and the truth of an implication does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the clug snugged, then the clug was fleeked' from 'If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged'.\n\nAnswer: no",
