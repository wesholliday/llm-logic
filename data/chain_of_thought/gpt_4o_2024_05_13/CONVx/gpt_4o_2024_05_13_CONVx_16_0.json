The original statement is: 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is 'the sneg was crampled' and \\( B \\) is 'the sneg sproted the frink'.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: 'If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled'.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow A \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) does not necessarily imply \\( B \\rightarrow A \\). The latter is known as the converse of the former, and the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled' from 'If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink'.\n\nAnswer: no",
