The given statement is: \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow T \\)\n   - Where \\( S \\) represents \"the whiffle was shanked\" and \\( T \\) represents \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the whiffle tinked, then the whiffle was shanked.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( T \\rightarrow S \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( S \\rightarrow T \\) does not imply \\( T \\rightarrow S \\). The original statement only tells us that if \\( S \\) is true, then \\( T \\) must be true. It does not provide any information about the truth of \\( S \\) if \\( T \\) is true.\n\n4. The only way \\( T \\rightarrow S \\) would be true is if \\( S \\leftrightarrow T \\) (if and only if) was given, which means \\( S \\) and \\( T \\) are both true or both false together. However, this is not provided in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the whiffle tinked, then the whiffle was shanked' from 'If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.'\n\nAnswer: no",
