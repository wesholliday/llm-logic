The original statement is: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and \\( B \\) is \"it surned\".\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow A \\)\n\nIn logic, \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) does not imply \\( B \\rightarrow A \\). The original statement only tells us that if \\( A \\) happens, then \\( B \\) will happen. It does not tell us that if \\( B \\) happens, then \\( A \\) must have happened. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the fleeg surned, then it was bluttered' from 'If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned'.\n\nAnswer: no",
