The original statement is: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\)\n   - This means that if \\( B \\) (the flugel was blimmed) is true, then \\( Z \\) (the flugel was zargled) must also be true.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was blimmed.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Z \\rightarrow B \\)\n\nTo determine if \\( Z \\rightarrow B \\) can be inferred from \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\), we need to consider the concept of logical equivalence and contrapositive.\n\n- The contrapositive of \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\) is \\( \\neg Z \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) (If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed).\n- The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nHowever, \\( Z \\rightarrow B \\) is not the contrapositive of \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\); it is the converse. The converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( Z \\rightarrow B \\) from \\( B \\rightarrow Z \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
