The original statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( S \\rightarrow G \\)\n   - This means that if \\( S \\) (the wug was sproinged) is true, then \\( G \\) (the wug was garpled) must also be true.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the wug was garpled, then it was sproinged.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( G \\rightarrow S \\)\n\nTo determine if \\( G \\rightarrow S \\) can be inferred from \\( S \\rightarrow G \\), we need to consider the rules of logical inference. Specifically, we need to check if the converse of an implication is logically equivalent to the original implication.\n\n- The converse of \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) is \\( G \\rightarrow S \\).\n- In general, an implication \\( S \\rightarrow G \\) does not imply its converse \\( G \\rightarrow S \\). \n\nTherefore, from the statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" (\\( S \\rightarrow G \\)), we cannot logically infer \"If the wug was garpled, then it was sproinged\" (\\( G \\rightarrow S \\)).\n\nAnswer: no",
