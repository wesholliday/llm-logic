The given statement is: 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint'.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is 'the smip was shripped' and \\( Q \\) is 'the smip lupped the zoint'.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: 'If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped'.\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not necessarily imply \\( Q \\rightarrow P \\). The latter is known as the converse of the former, and the truth of a statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped' from 'If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint'.\n\nAnswer: no",
