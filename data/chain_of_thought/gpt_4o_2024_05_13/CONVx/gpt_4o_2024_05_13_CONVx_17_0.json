The original statement is: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"the flob was skizzled\" and \\( B \\) is \"the flob movated.\"\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"If the flob movated, then the flob was skizzled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( B \\rightarrow A \\)\n\nIn logic, \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) does not necessarily imply \\( B \\rightarrow A \\). The original statement only tells us that if \\( A \\) happens, then \\( B \\) will happen. It does not provide information about what happens if \\( B \\) occurs first.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \\( B \\rightarrow A \\) from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
