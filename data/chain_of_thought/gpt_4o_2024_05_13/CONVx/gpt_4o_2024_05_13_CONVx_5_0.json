The given statement is: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( F \\rightarrow S \\)\n   - Where \\( F \\) represents \"the zinger was fraggled\" and \\( S \\) represents \"the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( S \\rightarrow F \\)\n\n3. In logic, \\( F \\rightarrow S \\) does not imply \\( S \\rightarrow F \\). The implication \\( F \\rightarrow S \\) means that if \\( F \\) is true, then \\( S \\) must be true. However, it does not provide any information about the truth of \\( F \\) if \\( S \\) is true.\n\n4. To infer \\( S \\rightarrow F \\) from \\( F \\rightarrow S \\), we would need the original statement to be a biconditional (i.e., \\( F \\leftrightarrow S \\)), which means \\( F \\) is true if and only if \\( S \\) is true. However, the given statement is not a biconditional; it is a simple conditional.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled' from 'If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled'.\n\nAnswer: no",
