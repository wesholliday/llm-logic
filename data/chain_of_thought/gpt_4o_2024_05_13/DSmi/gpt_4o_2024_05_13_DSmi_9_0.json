This means we cannot definitively conclude \\( \\neg Q \\) from Statement 2 alone.\n\nSince we cannot definitively conclude \\( \\neg Q \\), we cannot definitively conclude \\( P \\) based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box.\"\n\nAnswer: no",
