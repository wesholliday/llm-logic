It does not definitively state that Fido is not in the garden, only that it is a possibility.\n\nNow, let's consider the logical implications:\n\n- If \"Fido might not be in the garden,\" it means that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden. However, it does not rule out the possibility that Fido is in the garden.\n- The disjunction in Statement 1 (\"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\") means that if Fido is not inside, then Fido must be in the garden.\n\nGiven that \"Fido might not be in the garden\" does not definitively state that Fido is not in the garden, it does not provide enough information to conclude that Fido is definitely inside. It only suggests that there is a possibility that Fido is not in the garden, but it does not eliminate the possibility that Fido is in the garden.\n\nTherefore, we cannot definitively infer \"Fido is inside\" based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no",
