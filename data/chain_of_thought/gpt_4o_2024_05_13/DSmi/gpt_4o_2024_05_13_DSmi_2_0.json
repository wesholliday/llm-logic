It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n     - The book is on the shelf.\n     - The book is resting on the table.\n\n2. **Statement 2:** \"The book might not be resting on the table.\"\n   - This statement indicates that it is possible that the book is not on the table. However, it does not definitively state that the book is not on the table; it only suggests a possibility.\n\nTo infer \"The book is on the shelf,\" we need to establish that the book is definitely on the shelf. Let's consider the implications:\n\n- If the book is not on the table, then according to Statement 1, the book must be on the shelf.\n- However, Statement 2 only suggests that the book might not be on the table, not that it definitely is not on the table.\n\nSince Statement 2 does not definitively rule out the possibility of the book being on the table, we cannot conclusively infer that the book is on the shelf. The possibility remains that the book could still be on the table.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively conclude that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: no",
