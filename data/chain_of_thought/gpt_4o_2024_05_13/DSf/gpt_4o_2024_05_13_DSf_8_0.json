The first statement is: \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The remote control is hiding under the couch\" and \\( B \\) is \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (the remote control is on the coffee table) from these two statements.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( A \\lor B \\) (either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\)) and \\( \\neg A \\) (not \\( A \\)), we can conclude \\( B \\) (the other option must be true).\n\nTherefore, given \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), we can infer \\( B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
