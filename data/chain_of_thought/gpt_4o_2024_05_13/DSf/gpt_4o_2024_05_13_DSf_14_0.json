            "content": "To determine whether we can infer \"The milk is on the counter\" from the given statements, let's break down the logical structure step by step.\n\n1. The first statement is: \"Either the milk is chilling in the fridge or it is on the counter.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\vee B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The milk is chilling in the fridge\" and \\( B \\) is \"The milk is on the counter.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (\"The milk is on the counter\") from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nIn logic, the disjunction \\( A \\vee B \\) means that at least one of \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) must be true. Given \\( \\neg A \\) (which means \\( A \\) is false), the only way for \\( A \\vee B \\) to still be true is if \\( B \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, from \\( A \\vee B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\), we can infer \\( B \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
