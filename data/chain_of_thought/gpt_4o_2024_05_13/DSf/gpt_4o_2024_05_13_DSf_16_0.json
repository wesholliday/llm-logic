The first statement is: \"Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) is \"The pen is on my desk.\"\n     - And \\( Q \\) is \"The pen is in my bag.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The pen isn't on my desk.\"\n   - This can be represented in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nNow, we need to determine if \\( Q \\) (The pen is in my bag) can be inferred from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( P \\lor Q \\) (either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) is true)\n   - And \\( \\neg P \\) (not \\( P \\), meaning \\( P \\) is false)\n   - Then \\( Q \\) must be true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\lor Q \\) (Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag)\n- \\( \\neg P \\) (The pen isn't on my desk)\n\nWe can conclude:\n- \\( Q \\) (The pen is in my bag)\n\nAnswer: yes",
