The first statement is: \"Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( P \\lor J \\)\n     - Where \\( P \\) represents \"The cookies are hidden in the pantry.\"\n     - And \\( J \\) represents \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg P \\) means \"not P\" or \"The cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( J \\) (The cookies are in the jar) from \\( P \\lor J \\) and \\( \\neg P \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, specifically disjunctive syllogism:\n   - If we have \\( P \\lor J \\) (either P or J is true) and \\( \\neg P \\) (P is not true), then \\( J \\) must be true.\n\nGiven:\n- \\( P \\lor J \\)\n- \\( \\neg P \\)\n\nBy disjunctive syllogism, we can conclude:\n- \\( J \\)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The cookies are in the jar.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
