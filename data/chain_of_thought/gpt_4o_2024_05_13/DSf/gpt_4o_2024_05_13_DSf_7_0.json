The first statement is: \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( U \\lor C \\), where \\( U \\) stands for \"The umbrella is tucked away in the closet\" and \\( C \\) stands for \"The umbrella is in the car.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet.\"\n   - This can be represented logically as: \\( \\neg U \\).\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( C \\) (The umbrella is in the car) from these two statements.\n\nUsing logical reasoning:\n- The first statement \\( U \\lor C \\) means that at least one of \\( U \\) or \\( C \\) must be true.\n- The second statement \\( \\neg U \\) means that \\( U \\) is false.\n\nGiven \\( U \\lor C \\) and \\( \\neg U \\):\n- Since \\( U \\) is false, the only way for \\( U \\lor C \\) to be true is if \\( C \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \\( C \\) (The umbrella is in the car) must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes",
