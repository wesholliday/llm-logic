The first statement is: \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( A \\lor B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"The book is resting on the table\" and \\( B \\) is \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"The book isn't resting on the table.\"\n   - This can be represented as: \\( \\neg A \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( B \\) (The book is on the shelf) from \\( A \\lor B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nUsing the rules of logic:\n- From \\( A \\lor B \\) (Either \\( A \\) or \\( B \\) is true) and \\( \\neg A \\) (A is not true), we can conclude that \\( B \\) must be true.\n- This is because if \\( A \\) is false and \\( A \\lor B \\) is true, the only way for \\( A \\lor B \\) to be true is if \\( B \\) is true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
