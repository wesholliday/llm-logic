            "content": "To determine whether we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag, let's break down the statements step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement):\n   - \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( P \\lor Q \\)\n     - \\( P \\): The sunglasses are perched on her head.\n     - \\( Q \\): The sunglasses are in her bag.\n\n2. The second statement is a negation:\n   - \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head.\"\n   - This can be written in logical terms as: \\( \\neg P \\)\n\n3. We need to determine if we can infer \\( Q \\) (the sunglasses are in her bag) from these two statements.\n\nIn logical terms, we have:\n- \\( P \\lor Q \\) (Either \\( P \\) or \\( Q \\) is true)\n- \\( \\neg P \\) (Not \\( P \\))\n\nAccording to the rules of logic, if we have a disjunction \\( P \\lor Q \\) and we know that \\( P \\) is false (\\( \\neg P \\)), then \\( Q \\) must be true in order for the disjunction to hold true.\n\nTherefore, from \\( P \\lor Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\), we can infer \\( Q \\).\n\nAnswer: yes",
