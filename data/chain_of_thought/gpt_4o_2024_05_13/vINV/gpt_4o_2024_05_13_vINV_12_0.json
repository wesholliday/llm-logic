            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements involved.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n     where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"Joe did not go to the park\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. \n\nThe premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) means that if \\( P \\) is true, then \\( Q \\) must also be true. However, it does not provide information about what happens if \\( P \\) is false. \n\nThe conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is the contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). In logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. \n\nTherefore, if the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, then the contrapositive \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) must also be true.\n\nThus, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
