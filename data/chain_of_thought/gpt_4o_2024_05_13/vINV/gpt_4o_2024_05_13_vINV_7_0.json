            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise:** If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( A \\rightarrow C \\)\n     - Where \\( A \\) represents \"Alex finished the race\"\n     - And \\( C \\) represents \"Chris finished the race\"\n\n2. **Conclusion:** If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"Alex did not finish the race\"\n     - And \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"Chris did not finish the race\"\n\nNext, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This involves checking if \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) logically implies \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\).\n\nThis form of argument is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) is \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). It is a well-known logical principle that a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nHowever, the conclusion given is \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\), which is not the contrapositive of the premise \\( A \\rightarrow C \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the premise. The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTo further clarify, let's consider the truth table for \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\):\n\n| \\( A \\) | \\( C \\) | \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) | \\( \\neg A \\) | \\( \\neg C \\) | \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     | F           | F           | T                             |\n| T      | F      | F                     | F           | T           | T                             |\n| F      | T      | T                     | T           | F           | F                             |\n| F      | F      | T                     | T           | T           | T                             |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that \\( A \\rightarrow C \\) and \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) do not always have the same truth values. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
