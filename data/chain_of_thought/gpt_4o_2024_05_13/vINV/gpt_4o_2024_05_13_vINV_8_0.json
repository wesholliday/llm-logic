            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( V \\rightarrow M \\)\n     - Where \\( V \\) represents \"the vampire was awake\"\n     - And \\( M \\) represents \"the mummy was awake\"\n\n2. **Conclusion**: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg V \\) represents \"the vampire was not awake\"\n     - And \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"the mummy was not awake\"\n\nNext, we need to determine if \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) logically implies \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\nThis is a classic example of the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\nHowever, the conclusion given is \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\), which is not the contrapositive of the premise \\( V \\rightarrow M \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the premise.\n\nTo see if the inverse is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can use a truth table:\n\n| \\( V \\) | \\( M \\) | \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) | \\( \\neg V \\) | \\( \\neg M \\) | \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) |\n|--------|---------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| T      | T       | T                     | F           | F           | T                             |\n| T      | F       | F                     | F           | T           | T                             |\n| F      | T       | T                     | T           | F           | F                             |\n| F      | F       | T                     | T           | T           | T                             |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) and \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) do not always have the same truth values. Specifically, when \\( V \\) is false and \\( M \\) is true, \\( V \\rightarrow M \\) is true, but \\( \\neg V \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no",
