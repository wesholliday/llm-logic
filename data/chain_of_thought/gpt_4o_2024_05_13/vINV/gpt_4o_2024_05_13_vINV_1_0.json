            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( M \\rightarrow S \\)\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) logically implies \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nThis form of argument is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). It is a fundamental rule in logic that a statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nIn this case:\n- The original statement is \\( M \\rightarrow S \\).\n- The contrapositive of this statement is \\( \\neg S \\rightarrow \\neg M \\).\n\nHowever, the conclusion given is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\), which is not the contrapositive of the original statement. Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement.\n\nTo check the validity, we can use a truth table:\n\n| M | S | \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) | \\( \\neg M \\) | \\( \\neg S \\) | \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) |\n|---|---|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| T | T | T                     | F           | F           | T                             |\n| T | F | F                     | F           | T           | T                             |\n| F | T | T                     | T           | F           | F                             |\n| F | F | T                     | T           | T           | T                             |\n\nFrom the truth table, we see that there is a case (when \\( M \\) is false and \\( S \\) is true) where \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) is true, but \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\) is false. This means that \\( M \\rightarrow S \\) does not logically imply \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg S \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
