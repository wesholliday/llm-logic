            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements involved.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"Sam took a plane\" and \\( Q \\) is \"Erin took a train.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) logically implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nLet's use the contrapositive rule in logic, which states that a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n\nHowever, the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is not the contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the premise. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTo further illustrate, let's consider the truth table for \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\):\n\n| \\( P \\) | \\( Q \\) | \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) | \\( \\neg P \\) | \\( \\neg Q \\) | \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     | F           | F           | T                             |\n| T      | F      | F                     | F           | T           | T                             |\n| F      | T      | T                     | T           | F           | F                             |\n| F      | F      | T                     | T           | T           | T                             |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that there is a row (third row) where \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true but \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is false. This indicates that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not logically imply \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
