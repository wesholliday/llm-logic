            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements involved.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n     where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy played tennis.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\)\n\nWe need to determine if \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) logically implies \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\nTo do this, we can use the concept of the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). A conditional statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nHowever, the conclusion \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is not the contrapositive of the premise \\( J \\rightarrow A \\). The contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) would be \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg J \\).\n\nInstead, the conclusion \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is the inverse of the premise \\( J \\rightarrow A \\). The inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTo further verify, we can use a truth table to check the validity:\n\n| \\( J \\) | \\( A \\) | \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) | \\( \\neg J \\) | \\( \\neg A \\) | \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     | F           | F           | T                             |\n| T      | F      | F                     | F           | T           | T                             |\n| F      | T      | T                     | T           | F           | F                             |\n| F      | F      | T                     | T           | T           | T                             |\n\nFrom the truth table, we see that there is a row (third row) where \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) is true but \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg A \\) is false. This indicates that the premise does not logically imply the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
