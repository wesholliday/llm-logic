            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements involved.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n     where \\( A \\) represents \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) represents \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) logically implies \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n\nLet's use a truth table to analyze the statements:\n\n| \\( A \\) | \\( B \\) | \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) | \\( \\neg A \\) | \\( \\neg B \\) | \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     | F           | F           | T                             |\n| T      | F      | F                     | F           | T           | T                             |\n| F      | T      | T                     | T           | F           | F                             |\n| F      | F      | T                     | T           | T           | T                             |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is true in all cases except when \\( A \\) is true and \\( B \\) is false. However, \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is not always true when \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is true. Specifically, when \\( A \\) is false and \\( B \\) is true, \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is true, but \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) does not logically imply \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
