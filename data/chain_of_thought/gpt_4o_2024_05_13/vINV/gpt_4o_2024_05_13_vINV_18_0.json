            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements involved.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"the doll was plastic\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n   - This can be written in logical form as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This involves understanding the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nHowever, the conclusion given is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), which is not the contrapositive of the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the premise. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) does not logically follow from the premise \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
