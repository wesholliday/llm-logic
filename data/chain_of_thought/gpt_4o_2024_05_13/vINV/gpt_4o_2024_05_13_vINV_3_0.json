            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   - This can be symbolized as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n   - Where \\( P \\) is \"the book was written by James\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the book is a mystery novel\".\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\n   - This can be symbolized as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the book was not written by James\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the book is not a mystery novel\".\n\nThe argument is asking if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) logically implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nThis form of argument is known as the contrapositive. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nHowever, the conclusion given is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), which is not the contrapositive of \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTo further clarify, let's consider the truth table for \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\):\n\n| \\( P \\) | \\( Q \\) | \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) | \\( \\neg P \\) | \\( \\neg Q \\) | \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     | F           | F           | T                             |\n| T      | F      | F                     | F           | T           | T                             |\n| F      | T      | T                     | T           | F           | F                             |\n| F      | F      | T                     | T           | T           | T                             |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) do not always have the same truth values. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
