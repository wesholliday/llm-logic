            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) is \"the car was red\" and \\( Q \\) is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n   - This can be written in logical notation as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n     where \\( \\neg P \\) is \"the car was not red\" and \\( \\neg Q \\) is \"the truck was not blue.\"\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) logically implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\n3. Let's consider the truth table for \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\):\n\n   | P | Q | \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) |\n   |---|---|----------------------|\n   | T | T | T                    |\n   | T | F | F                    |\n   | F | T | T                    |\n   | F | F | T                    |\n\n4. Now, let's consider the truth table for \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\):\n\n   | P | Q | \\( \\neg P \\) | \\( \\neg Q \\) | \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) |\n   |---|---|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n   | T | T | F           | F           | T                             |\n   | T | F | F           | T           | T                             |\n   | F | T | T           | F           | F                             |\n   | F | F | T           | T           | T                             |\n\n5. Comparing the two truth tables, we see that \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) and \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) do not have the same truth values in all cases. Specifically, when \\( P \\) is false and \\( Q \\) is true, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is true, but \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\) is false.\n\nTherefore, \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) does not logically imply \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
