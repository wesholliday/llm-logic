            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the statements involved.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\)\n\nThe argument is asking whether \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) logically implies \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\).\n\nTo analyze this, we can use the concept of the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). A conditional statement is always logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nHowever, the conclusion \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is not the contrapositive of the premise \\( T \\rightarrow J \\). Instead, the contrapositive of \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) would be \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\).\n\nTo see if \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) implies \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\), we can use a truth table:\n\n| \\( T \\) | \\( J \\) | \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) | \\( \\neg T \\) | \\( \\neg J \\) | \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) |\n|--------|--------|------------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                      | F           | F           | T                             |\n| T      | F      | F                      | F           | T           | T                             |\n| F      | T      | T                      | T           | F           | F                             |\n| F      | F      | T                      | T           | T           | T                             |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that there is a row (third row: \\( T = F \\), \\( J = T \\)) where \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is true but \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) is false. This means that \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) does not logically imply \\( \\neg T \\rightarrow \\neg J \\).\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
