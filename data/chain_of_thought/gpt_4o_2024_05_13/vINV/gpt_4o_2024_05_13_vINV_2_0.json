            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise**: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( G \\rightarrow U \\)\n     - Where \\( G \\) represents \"the griffin was in the forest\"\n     - And \\( U \\) represents \"the unicorn was in the forest\"\n\n2. **Conclusion**: If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( \\neg G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg G \\) represents \"the griffin was not in the forest\"\n     - And \\( \\neg U \\) represents \"the unicorn was not in the forest\"\n\nNext, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This involves checking if the conclusion is a valid inference from the premise.\n\nThe form of the argument is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). It is a well-known logical principle that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\nIn this case:\n- The premise \\( G \\rightarrow U \\) has the contrapositive \\( \\neg U \\rightarrow \\neg G \\).\n- The conclusion \\( \\neg G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\) is not the contrapositive of the premise but rather the inverse.\n\nTo check the validity, we can use truth tables or logical equivalence rules. However, we know from logical principles that the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion \\( \\neg G \\rightarrow \\neg U \\) does not logically follow from the premise \\( G \\rightarrow U \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
