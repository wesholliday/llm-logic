            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise:** If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n     - Where \\( A \\) represents \"the alien visited Mars\"\n     - And \\( B \\) represents \"the robot visited Jupiter\"\n\n2. **Conclusion:** If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"the alien did not visit Mars\"\n     - And \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the robot did not visit Jupiter\"\n\nNext, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This involves checking if \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) logically implies \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n\nThis form of argument is known as the contrapositive. In logic, the contrapositive of a statement \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) is \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\). A statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, meaning if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\nHowever, the conclusion given is \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\), which is not the contrapositive of \\( A \\rightarrow B \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the original statement. The inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTo further illustrate, let's consider the truth table for \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\):\n\n| \\( A \\) | \\( B \\) | \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) | \\( \\neg A \\) | \\( \\neg B \\) | \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) |\n|--------|--------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| T      | T      | T                     | F           | F           | T                             |\n| T      | F      | F                     | F           | T           | F                             |\n| F      | T      | T                     | T           | F           | F                             |\n| F      | F      | T                     | T           | T           | T                             |\n\nFrom the truth table, we can see that \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg A \\rightarrow \\neg B \\) do not always have the same truth values. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no",
