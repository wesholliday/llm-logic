            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( L \\rightarrow M \\)\n     where \\( L \\) represents \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and \\( M \\) represents \"Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\)\n     where \\( \\neg L \\) represents \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" and \\( \\neg M \\) represents \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to use the concept of the contrapositive in logic.\n\n- The contrapositive of a conditional statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n- The contrapositive of the premise \\( L \\rightarrow M \\) is \\( \\neg M \\rightarrow \\neg L \\).\n\nThe conclusion \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) is not the contrapositive of the premise \\( L \\rightarrow M \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the premise.\n\nIn logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg M \\) does not logically follow from the premise \\( L \\rightarrow M \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
