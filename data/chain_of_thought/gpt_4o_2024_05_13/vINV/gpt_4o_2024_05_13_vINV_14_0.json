            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( B \\rightarrow W \\)\n     where \\( B \\) represents \"the bear was in the cave\" and \\( W \\) represents \"the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg W \\)\n     where \\( \\neg B \\) represents \"the bear was not in the cave\" and \\( \\neg W \\) represents \"the wolf was not in the den.\"\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. This involves understanding the contrapositive of a conditional statement.\n\n- The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\).\n- The contrapositive of the premise \\( B \\rightarrow W \\) is \\( \\neg W \\rightarrow \\neg B \\).\n\nThe conclusion \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) is not the contrapositive of the premise \\( B \\rightarrow W \\). Instead, it is the inverse of the premise.\n\n- The inverse of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nIn logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the conclusion \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg W \\) does not logically follow from the premise \\( B \\rightarrow W \\).\n\nAnswer: no",
