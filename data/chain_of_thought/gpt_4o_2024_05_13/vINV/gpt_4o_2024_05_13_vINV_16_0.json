            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. The premise is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\)\n     where \\( P \\) represents \"the shirt was cotton\" and \\( Q \\) represents \"the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. The conclusion is: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n   - In logical notation, this can be written as: \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\)\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) logically implies \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\).\n\nThis form of argument is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is \\( \\neg Q \\rightarrow \\neg P \\). However, the conclusion given is \\( \\neg P \\rightarrow \\neg Q \\), which is not the contrapositive but rather the inverse of the original statement.\n\nThe inverse of a statement \\( P \\rightarrow Q \\) is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the inverse does not necessarily follow from the original implication.\n\nAnswer: no",
