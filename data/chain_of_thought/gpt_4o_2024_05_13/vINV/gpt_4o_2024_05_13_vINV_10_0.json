            "content": "To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to analyze the logical structure of the premise and the conclusion.\n\n1. **Premise:** If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( D \\rightarrow C \\)\n     - Where \\( D \\) represents \"the dog was inside\" and \\( C \\) represents \"the cat was outside\".\n\n2. **Conclusion:** If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\n   - Symbolically, this can be written as: \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)\n     - Where \\( \\neg D \\) represents \"the dog was not inside\" and \\( \\neg C \\) represents \"the cat was not outside\".\n\nTo check the validity, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. One way to do this is to use the contrapositive of the premise.\n\n- The contrapositive of \\( D \\rightarrow C \\) is \\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\).\n  - This means \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\nNow, compare the contrapositive of the premise (\\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\)) with the conclusion (\\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)).\n\n- The contrapositive of the premise (\\( \\neg C \\rightarrow \\neg D \\)) is not the same as the conclusion (\\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\)).\n- In fact, \\( \\neg D \\rightarrow \\neg C \\) is the converse of the contrapositive of the premise, and the converse is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: no",
