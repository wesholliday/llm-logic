To infer that the restaurant must have been closed on Monday, we would need additional information that rules out the possibility of it being open for limited hours. Without such information, we cannot definitively conclude that the restaurant was closed on Monday, as the possibility of it being open for limited hours still exists.\n\nAnswer: no",
