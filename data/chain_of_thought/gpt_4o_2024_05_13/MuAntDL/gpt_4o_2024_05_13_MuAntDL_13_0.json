To infer that \"The movie must have been in English\" from this statement would be incorrect because it ignores the second possibility that the movie could have been subtitled. The original statement does not provide enough information to conclude definitively that the movie was in English; it only states that one of the two conditions (being in English or being subtitled) must be true.\n\nAnswer: no",
