            "content": "Explanation: The original statement \"The document must have been signed or notarized\" presents two possible conditions: either the document was signed, or it was notarized. For the document to meet the requirement, it only needs to satisfy one of these conditions. Therefore, it is not necessary for the document to have been signed if it was notarized instead. Since the statement allows for the possibility that the document was only notarized and not signed, we cannot definitively infer that the document must have been signed.\n\nAnswer: no",
