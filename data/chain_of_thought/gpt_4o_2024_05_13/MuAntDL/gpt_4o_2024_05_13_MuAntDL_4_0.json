To infer that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" from this statement alone would be incorrect because it ignores the second possibility that the meeting could have been cancelled. Without additional information to rule out the cancellation, we cannot definitively conclude that the meeting was at 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: no",
