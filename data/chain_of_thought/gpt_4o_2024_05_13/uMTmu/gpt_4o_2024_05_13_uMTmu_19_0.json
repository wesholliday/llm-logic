            "content": "To determine whether Tom did not watch football, let's analyze the given statements step by step:\n\n1. The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( T \\rightarrow J \\)\n   where \\( T \\) represents \"Tom watched football\" and \\( J \\) represents \"Jen must have watched basketball.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg J \\)\n   where \\( \\neg J \\) represents \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg T \\) (Tom did not watch football) from these statements.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) and \\( \\neg J \\), we can use the contrapositive to infer \\( \\neg T \\). The contrapositive of \\( T \\rightarrow J \\) is:\n   \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\)\n\n4. Since we have \\( \\neg J \\) (Jen did not watch basketball), and the contrapositive tells us that \\( \\neg J \\rightarrow \\neg T \\), we can conclude \\( \\neg T \\) (Tom did not watch football).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes",
