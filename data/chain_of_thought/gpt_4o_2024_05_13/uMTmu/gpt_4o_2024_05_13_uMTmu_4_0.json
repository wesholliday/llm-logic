This is because a conditional statement \\( A \\rightarrow R \\) is only false if \\( A \\) is true and \\( R \\) is false. In all other cases (including when \\( A \\) is false), the conditional statement is true.\n\nTherefore, since \\( R \\) is false, \\( A \\) must be false to satisfy the conditional statement.\n\nThus, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: no",
