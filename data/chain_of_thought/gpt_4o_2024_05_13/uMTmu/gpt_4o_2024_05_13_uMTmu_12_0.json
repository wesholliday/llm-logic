The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( J \\rightarrow L \\)\n   - Where \\( J \\) represents \"Joe went to the park\" and \\( L \\) represents \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg L \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg L \\) represents \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg J \\) (Joe did not go to the park) from these statements.\n\nUsing the contrapositive of the first statement:\n- The contrapositive of \\( J \\rightarrow L \\) is \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\).\n- This means \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\nGiven \\( \\neg L \\) (Lucy did not go to the zoo), we can apply the contrapositive:\n- From \\( \\neg L \\rightarrow \\neg J \\) and \\( \\neg L \\), we can infer \\( \\neg J \\).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes",
