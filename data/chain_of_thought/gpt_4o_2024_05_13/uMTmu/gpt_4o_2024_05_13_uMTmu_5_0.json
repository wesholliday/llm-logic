The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( J \\rightarrow A \\)\n   where \\( J \\) represents \"Jeff played basketball\" and \\( A \\) represents \"Amy must have played tennis.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This can be written in logical form as:\n   \\( \\neg A \\)\n   where \\( \\neg A \\) represents \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball) from these statements.\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if we have a conditional statement \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) and we know \\( \\neg A \\) (the negation of the consequent), we can infer the negation of the antecedent \\( \\neg J \\). This is known as modus tollens.\n\n4. Applying modus tollens to our statements:\n   - We have \\( J \\rightarrow A \\) (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis).\n   - We also have \\( \\neg A \\) (Amy did not play tennis).\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n   - \\( \\neg J \\) (Jeff did not play basketball).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes",
