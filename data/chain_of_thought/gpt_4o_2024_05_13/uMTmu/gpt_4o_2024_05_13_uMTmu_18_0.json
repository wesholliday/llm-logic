Modus tollens is a valid form of argument that states:\n- If \\( P \\rightarrow M \\) (if P then M)\n- And \\( \\neg M \\) (not M)\n- Then \\( \\neg P \\) (not P)\n\nApplying modus tollens to our statements:\n- \\( P \\rightarrow M \\) (If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal)\n- \\( \\neg M \\) (It's not the case that the truck must have been metal)\n\nFrom these, we can infer:\n- \\( \\neg P \\) (The doll was not plastic)\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes",
