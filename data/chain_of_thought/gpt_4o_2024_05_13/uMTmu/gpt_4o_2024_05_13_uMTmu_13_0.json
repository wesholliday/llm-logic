The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nSo, the contrapositive of \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" is:\n- \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n- In logical terms: \\( \\neg (\\text{Truck is blue}) \\rightarrow \\neg (\\text{Car is red}) \\).\n\nGiven that \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\" (\\( \\neg (\\text{Truck is blue}) \\)), we can apply the contrapositive:\n- Since \\( \\neg (\\text{Truck is blue}) \\) is true, it follows that \\( \\neg (\\text{Car is red}) \\) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes",
