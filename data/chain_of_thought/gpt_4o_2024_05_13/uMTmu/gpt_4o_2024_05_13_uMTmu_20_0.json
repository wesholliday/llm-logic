The first statement is a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - Where \\( A \\) is \"the apple was red\" and \\( B \\) is \"the banana must have been yellow.\"\n\n2. The second statement is: \"It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\"\n   - This can be written as: \\( \\neg B \\)\n   - Where \\( \\neg B \\) means \"the banana was not yellow.\"\n\nNow, we need to determine if we can infer \\( \\neg A \\) (the apple was not red) from \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) and \\( \\neg B \\).\n\n3. According to the rules of logic, if \\( A \\rightarrow B \\) (if A then B) and \\( \\neg B \\) (not B) are both true, then \\( \\neg A \\) (not A) must be true. This is known as the contrapositive rule, which states that \\( (A \\rightarrow B) \\equiv (\\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A) \\).\n\n4. Given:\n   - \\( A \\rightarrow B \\)\n   - \\( \\neg B \\)\n\n5. By the contrapositive rule:\n   - From \\( A \\rightarrow B \\), we can infer \\( \\neg B \\rightarrow \\neg A \\).\n\n6. Since \\( \\neg B \\) is true, we can conclude \\( \\neg A \\).\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: no",
