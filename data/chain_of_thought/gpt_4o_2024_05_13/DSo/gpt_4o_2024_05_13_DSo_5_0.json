The first statement is: \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This means that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the cookies are in the jar, or the cookies are hidden in the pantry.\n\nGiven these two statements, let's combine the information:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the cookies are not in the pantry.\n- The second statement tells us that if the cookies are not in the pantry, then they must be in the jar (since one of the two conditions must be true).\n\nSince the cookies are not in the pantry, the only remaining possibility according to the second statement is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: yes",
