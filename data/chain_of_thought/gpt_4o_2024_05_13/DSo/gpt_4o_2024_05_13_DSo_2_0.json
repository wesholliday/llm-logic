The first statement is: \"The book isn't resting on the table.\"\n   - This means the book is not on the table.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the book is on the shelf, or it is resting on the table.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the process of elimination:\n\n- From the first statement, we know the book is not resting on the table.\n- The second statement tells us that if the book is not resting on the table, then the only remaining option is that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes",
