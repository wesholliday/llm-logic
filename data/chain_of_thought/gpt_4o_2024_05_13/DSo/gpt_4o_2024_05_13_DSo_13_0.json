The first statement is: \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf.\"\n   - This means the toy is not on the shelf.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction (an \"or\" statement), which means at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n     a) The toy is in the toy box.\n     b) The toy is sitting on the shelf.\n\nGiven that the toy is not sitting on the shelf (from the first statement), the second condition (b) is false. For the disjunction to be true, the first condition (a) must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes",
