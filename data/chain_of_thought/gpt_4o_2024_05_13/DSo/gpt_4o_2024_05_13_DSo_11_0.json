The first statement is: \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\"\n   - This means the newspaper is not on the porch.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the newspaper is in the driveway, or it is on the porch.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the process of elimination:\n\n- From the first statement, we know the newspaper is not on the porch.\n- The second statement tells us that if the newspaper is not on the porch, then it must be in the driveway (since one of the two conditions must be true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can conclude that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes",
