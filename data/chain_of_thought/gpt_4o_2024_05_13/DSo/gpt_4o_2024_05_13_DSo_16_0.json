The first statement is: \"The pen isn't on my desk.\"\n   - This means that the pen is not located on the desk.\n\n2. The second statement is: \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk.\"\n   - This is a logical disjunction, meaning that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the pen is in the bag, or the pen is on the desk.\n\nGiven these two statements, we can use the process of elimination:\n\n- From the first statement, we know that the pen is not on the desk.\n- The second statement tells us that if the pen is not on the desk, then it must be in the bag (since one of the two conditions must be true).\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can logically infer that the pen is in the bag.\n\nAnswer: yes",
