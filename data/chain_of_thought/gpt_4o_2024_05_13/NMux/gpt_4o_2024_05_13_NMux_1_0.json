In other words, the flugel being blimmed is not a certainty.\n\n2. **Inference: \"The flugel might not have been blimmed.\"**\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\n- If it is not necessarily true that the flugel was blimmed, then it is possible that the flugel was not blimmed. This aligns with the idea that there is a possibility (or might) that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nTherefore, the inference 'The flugel might not have been blimmed' logically follows from the original statement 'It's not the case that the flugel must have been blimmed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
