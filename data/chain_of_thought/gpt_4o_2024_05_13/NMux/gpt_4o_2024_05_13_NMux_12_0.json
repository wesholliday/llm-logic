In other words, the smip being shripped is not a certainty.\n\n2. **Inference: \"The smip might not have been shripped.\"**\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the smip was not shripped.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between the two statements:\n\n- If it is not necessarily true that the smip was shripped, then it is possible that the smip was not shripped. This aligns with the idea that there is a possibility (or might) that the smip was not shripped.\n\nTherefore, the original statement implies that there is a possibility that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: yes",
