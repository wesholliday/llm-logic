In other words, the smonk being vreebled is not a certainty.\n\n2. **Inference: \"The smonk might not have been vreebled.\"**\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\n- If it is not necessarily true that the smonk was vreebled, then it must be possible that the smonk was not vreebled. This is because the negation of a necessity implies the possibility of the opposite. \n\nTherefore, if it is not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled, it logically follows that the smonk might not have been vreebled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
