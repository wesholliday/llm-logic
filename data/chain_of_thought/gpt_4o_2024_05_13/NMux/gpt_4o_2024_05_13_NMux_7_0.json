The original statement is: \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked.\"\n   - This means that it is not necessarily true that the whiffle was shanked. In other words, the whiffle being shanked is not a certainty.\n\n2. The statement we want to infer is: \"The whiffle might not have been shanked.\"\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the whiffle was shanked, then it must be possible that the whiffle was not shanked. Therefore, the possibility that the whiffle was not shanked is consistent with the original statement.\n\nThus, we can infer that \"The whiffle might not have been shanked\" from \"It's not the case that the whiffle must have been shanked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes",
