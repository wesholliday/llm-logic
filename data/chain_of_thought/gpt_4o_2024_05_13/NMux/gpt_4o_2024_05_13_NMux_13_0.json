In other words, the glip being slogged is not a certainty.\n\n2. **Inference: \"The glip might not have been slogged.\"**\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the glip was not slogged.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between the two statements:\n\n- If it is not necessarily true that the glip was slogged, then it must be possible that the glip was not slogged. This aligns with the idea that there is a possibility (i.e., \"might\") that the glip was not slogged.\n\nTherefore, the original statement implies that there is a possibility that the glip was not slogged.\n\nAnswer: yes",
