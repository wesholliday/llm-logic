In other words, the flug being blummed is not a certainty.\n\n2. **Inference: \"The flug might not have been blummed.\"**\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the flug was not blummed.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between the two statements:\n\n- If it is not necessarily true that the flug was blummed, then it is possible that the flug was not blummed. This aligns with the idea that there is a possibility (or might) that the flug was not blummed.\n\nTherefore, the inference 'The flug might not have been blummed' logically follows from the original statement 'It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
