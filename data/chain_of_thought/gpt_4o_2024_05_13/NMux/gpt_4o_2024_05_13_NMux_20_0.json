In other words, the fleeg being bluttered is not a certainty.\n\n2. **Inference: \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered.\"**\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\n- If it is not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered, then it is possible that the fleeg was not bluttered. This aligns with the idea that there is a possibility (or might) that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nTherefore, the original statement implies that there is a possibility that the fleeg was not bluttered, which matches the inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
