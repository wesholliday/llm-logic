'It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed' means that it is not necessarily true that the grommet was sploffed. In other words, the grommet being sploffed is not a certainty.\n\n2. 'The grommet might not have been sploffed' means that there is a possibility that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the grommet was sploffed, then it is possible that the grommet was not sploffed. This aligns with the idea that the grommet might not have been sploffed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer 'The grommet might not have been sploffed' from 'It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
