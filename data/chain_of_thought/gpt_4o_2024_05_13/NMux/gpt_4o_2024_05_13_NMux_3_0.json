'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed' means that it is not necessarily true that the splat was morphed. This implies that there is a possibility that the splat was not morphed.\n\n2. 'The splat might not have been morphed' means that it is possible that the splat was not morphed.\n\nSince both statements suggest the possibility that the splat was not morphed, we can infer 'The splat might not have been morphed' from 'It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
