In other words, the flob being skizzled is not a requirement or a certainty.\n\n2. **Inference: \"The flob might not have been skizzled.\"**\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\n- If it is not the case that the flob must have been skizzled, then it is possible that the flob was not skizzled. This aligns with the idea that there is no necessity for the flob to have been skizzled, implying that there is a possibility (however small) that the flob was not skizzled.\n\nTherefore, the inference 'The flob might not have been skizzled' logically follows from 'It's not the case that the flob must have been skizzled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
