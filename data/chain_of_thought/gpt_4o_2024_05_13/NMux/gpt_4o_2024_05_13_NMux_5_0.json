'It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled' means that it is not necessarily true that the zinger was fraggled. In other words, the zinger being fraggled is not a certainty.\n\n2. 'The zinger might not have been fraggled' means that there is a possibility that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nIf it is not necessarily true that the zinger was fraggled, then it is possible that the zinger was not fraggled. Therefore, the statement 'The zinger might not have been fraggled' is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: yes",
