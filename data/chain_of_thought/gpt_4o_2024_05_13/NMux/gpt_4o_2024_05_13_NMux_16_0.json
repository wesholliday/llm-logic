In other words, the crampling of the sneg is not a certainty.\n\n2. **Inference: \"The sneg might not have been crampled.\"**\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nNow, let's analyze the logical relationship between these two statements:\n\n- If it is not the case that the sneg must have been crampled, this implies that there is no absolute necessity for the sneg to have been crampled. Therefore, it opens up the possibility that the sneg was not crampled.\n\n- In other words, if something is not necessarily true, it means that its negation is possible. Hence, if the sneg does not have to be crampled, it is possible that it was not crampled.\n\nTherefore, the inference 'The sneg might not have been crampled' logically follows from 'It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled'.\n\nAnswer: yes",
