'It's not the case that the shank must have been plooked':\n   - This means that it is not necessarily true that the shank was plooked. In other words, the shank being plooked is not a certainty.\n\n2. 'The shank might not have been plooked':\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the shank was not plooked.\n\nGiven that the first statement denies the necessity of the shank being plooked, it implies that there is at least some possibility that the shank was not plooked. Therefore, the first statement allows for the possibility that the shank might not have been plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes",
