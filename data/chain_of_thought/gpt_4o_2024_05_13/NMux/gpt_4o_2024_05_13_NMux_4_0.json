In other words, the fribble being snurgled is not a certainty.\n\n2. **Logical Implication:**\n   - If it is not necessarily true that the fribble was snurgled, then there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled. This introduces the idea of potentiality or possibility.\n\n3. **Restating the Implication:**\n   - If there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled, we can say that it might not have been snurgled.\n\nTherefore, the statement 'It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled' implies that there is a possibility that the fribble was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: yes",
