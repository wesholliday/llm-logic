In other words, the clug being fleeked is not a certainty.\n\n2. **Inference: \"The clug might not have been fleeked.\"**\n   - This means that there is a possibility that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nIf the clug must have been fleeked, it implies that there is no possibility that the clug was not fleeked. However, since the original statement denies this necessity, it opens up the possibility that the clug was not fleeked. Therefore, the clug might not have been fleeked.\n\nThus, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes",
