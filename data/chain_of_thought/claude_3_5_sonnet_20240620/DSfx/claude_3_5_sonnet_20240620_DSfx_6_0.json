            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either the grommet is plopped or it is sploffed\"\n   b) \"The grommet is not plopped\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the grommet is plopped, or it is sploffed, or both.\n\n3. The second statement explicitly tells us that the grommet is not plopped. This eliminates the first option in the disjunction.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as disjunctive syllogism. When we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n5. Since we know the grommet is not plopped, and it must be either plopped or sploffed, we can logically conclude that it must be sploffed.\n\n6. This inference is valid and follows directly from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
