            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked\"\n   b) \"The sprocket is not daggled\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: the sprocket is either daggled or cranked (or possibly both, in the case of an inclusive OR).\n\n3. The second statement explicitly tells us that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\n4. Given that the first statement says it must be one or the other, and the second statement rules out the \"daggled\" option, we are left with only one possibility: the sprocket must be cranked.\n\n5. This is an example of a logical inference called \"disjunctive syllogism.\" When we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n6. Therefore, from the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The sprocket is cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
