            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The application must have been completed online and included references.\"\n\n2. This statement is a compound requirement, consisting of two parts:\n   a) The application must have been completed online\n   b) The application must have included references\n\n3. The word \"and\" in the original statement indicates that both conditions must be met for the statement to be true.\n\n4. The question asks if we can infer \"The application must have been completed online\" from the original statement.\n\n5. Since this is one of the two conditions explicitly stated in the original sentence, we can indeed infer it.\n\n6. The fact that the application also needed to include references doesn't negate or change the requirement for it to be completed online.\n\n7. In logical terms, if A and B are true, then A is true on its own.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently infer that \"The application must have been completed online\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
