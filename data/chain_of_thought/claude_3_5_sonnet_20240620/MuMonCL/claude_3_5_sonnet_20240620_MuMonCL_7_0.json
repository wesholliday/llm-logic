The additional information about covering all chapters does not negate or contradict the exam's difficulty. Instead, it provides extra information about the exam's content.\n\nBy inferring only the first part, we are not changing the meaning of that particular aspect of the statement. We are simply omitting additional information about the exam's coverage.\n\nWhile we lose some information by not including the part about covering all chapters, the inference about the exam's difficulty remains true to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"The exam must have been difficult\" from the given statement without contradicting or misrepresenting the original meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
