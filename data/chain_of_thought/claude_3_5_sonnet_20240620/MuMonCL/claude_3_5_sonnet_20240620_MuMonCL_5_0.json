            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for.\"\n\n2. This statement consists of two parts connected by \"and\":\n   a) The package must have been delivered today\n   b) The package must have been signed for\n\n3. In logic, when two statements are connected by \"and,\" both parts must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n4. If the entire statement is true, then each individual part must also be true on its own.\n\n5. Therefore, if it's true that \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for,\" then it must also be true that \"The package must have been delivered today.\"\n\n6. The second part about signing is additional information that doesn't change the truth of the first part.\n\n7. We're not removing any essential information by focusing only on the delivery part, as the delivery is a necessary condition for the package to be signed for.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer the statement \"The package must have been delivered today\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
