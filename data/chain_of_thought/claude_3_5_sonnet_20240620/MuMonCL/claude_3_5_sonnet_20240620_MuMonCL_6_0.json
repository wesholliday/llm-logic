            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM.\"\n\n2. This statement is a compound sentence containing two separate pieces of information connected by the word \"and\":\n   a) The concert must have been sold out\n   b) The concert started at 8 PM\n\n3. When we use \"and\" to connect two statements, it means both statements are true.\n\n4. The question asks if we can infer \"The concert must have been sold out\" from the original statement.\n\n5. Since this exact phrase is present in the original statement as one of the two connected pieces of information, we can directly extract it without changing its meaning.\n\n6. The presence of additional information (about the start time) doesn't affect the validity of the statement about the concert being sold out.\n\n7. Therefore, we can confidently infer \"The concert must have been sold out\" from the original statement, as it's a direct subset of the information provided.\n\nAnswer: yes"
