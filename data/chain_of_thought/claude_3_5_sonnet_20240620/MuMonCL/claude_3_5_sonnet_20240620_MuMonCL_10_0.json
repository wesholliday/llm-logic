            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The document must have been signed and notarized.\"\n\n2. This statement uses the conjunction \"and,\" which means both conditions must be met:\n   a) The document must have been signed\n   b) The document must have been notarized\n\n3. In logic, when we have a compound statement using \"and,\" we can infer each individual part of the statement separately. This is known as the \"simplification\" rule of inference.\n\n4. Therefore, if it's true that \"The document must have been signed and notarized,\" then it must also be true that \"The document must have been signed.\"\n\n5. The second part about notarization is not relevant to the inference we're trying to make, so we can disregard it for this particular question.\n\n6. The inference we're asked about only concerns the signing of the document, which is explicitly stated in the original compound statement.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can confidently infer that \"The document must have been signed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
