            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\"\n   b) \"The book isn't resting on the table\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true:\n   - The book is on the shelf\n   - The book is resting on the table\n\n3. The second statement explicitly negates one of these options:\n   - The book is NOT resting on the table\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as disjunctive syllogism. When we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n5. Since we know the book is not on the table, and it must be either on the shelf or on the table, we can logically conclude that it must be on the shelf.\n\n6. There are no other possibilities given in the premises, so we don't need to consider any other locations for the book.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The book is on the shelf.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
