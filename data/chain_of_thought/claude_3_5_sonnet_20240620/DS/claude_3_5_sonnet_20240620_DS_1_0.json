            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden\"\n   b) \"Fido is not in the garden\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true: Fido is inside, or Fido is in the garden.\n\n3. The second statement explicitly tells us that one of these options is false: Fido is not in the garden.\n\n4. In logic, when we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true. This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\n5. Since we know Fido is not in the garden, and the original statement says Fido must be either inside or in the garden, we can logically conclude that Fido must be inside.\n\n6. This inference is valid because there are no other possibilities given in the original statement. If there were other possible locations for Fido, we couldn't make this conclusion with certainty.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
