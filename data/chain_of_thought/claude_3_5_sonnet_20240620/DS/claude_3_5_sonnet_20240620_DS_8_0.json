            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with two pieces of information:\n   a) Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n   b) The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true, possibly both.\n\n3. The second statement eliminates one of the options from the first statement. We know for certain that the remote is not under the couch.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as disjunctive syllogism. When we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n5. Since we know the remote is not under the couch, and it must be either under the couch or on the coffee table, we can logically conclude that it must be on the coffee table.\n\n6. There are no other alternatives presented, and the original statement doesn't allow for any other possibilities.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
