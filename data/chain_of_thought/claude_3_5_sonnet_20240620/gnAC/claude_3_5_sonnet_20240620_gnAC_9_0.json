            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". In this case:\n   A = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B is true (Mark did buy the blue shirt).\n\n4. However, we need to be careful here. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt; it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if she doesn't.\n\n5. In logical terms, \"If A, then B\" does not mean the same as \"If B, then A\". This is a common logical fallacy known as the converse error.\n\n6. The original statement only guarantees that if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark would buy the blue shirt. It doesn't guarantee the reverse.\n\n7. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt that have nothing to do with Lisa's purchase.\n\n8. Therefore, while we know Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot conclude with certainty that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
