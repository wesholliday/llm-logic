            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (Let's call this statement P \u2192 Q)\n   b) The banana was yellow. (This is Q)\n\n2. We need to determine if we can conclude that the apple was red (P).\n\n3. The first statement is a conditional statement (if-then). It tells us that if the apple is red, the banana must be yellow. However, it doesn't tell us anything about the color of the apple if the banana is yellow.\n\n4. The second statement confirms that the banana is indeed yellow.\n\n5. While this matches the consequent (then part) of the conditional statement, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (if part) must be true.\n\n6. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because Q is true, it doesn't mean P must be true.\n\n7. For example, the banana could be yellow for other reasons, regardless of the apple's color. The apple could be green, or any other color, and the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" would still be true.\n\n8. To illustrate further: If it rains, the grass is wet. The grass is wet. Does it necessarily mean it rained? No, because the grass could be wet for other reasons (like sprinklers).\n\n9. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the apple was red based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
