            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". This means that whenever A is true, B must also be true. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if B is true, A must be true.\n\n3. We know that Sue was at the wedding (B is true). But this doesn't necessarily mean that Mary was at the wedding (A might or might not be true).\n\n4. To illustrate this, let's consider some possibilities:\n   - Mary was at the wedding, and Sue was at the wedding (consistent with both given statements)\n   - Mary was not at the wedding, but Sue was at the wedding (also consistent with both given statements)\n\n5. The conditional statement only tells us what must happen if Mary is at the wedding, but it doesn't tell us anything about whether Mary must be at the wedding if Sue is there.\n\n6. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\". Just because the consequent (Sue at the wedding) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (Mary at the wedding) is true.\n\nTherefore, while it's possible that Mary was at the wedding, we cannot conclude with certainty that she was there based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
