            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The election might be close and require a recount.\"\n\n2. This statement consists of two parts connected by \"and\":\n   a) The election might be close\n   b) The election might require a recount\n\n3. The word \"and\" implies that both conditions are possible.\n\n4. The question asks if we can infer: \"The election might require a recount.\"\n\n5. This inference is directly stated in part (b) of the original statement.\n\n6. The original statement provides more information (that the election might be close), but it doesn't negate or contradict the inference.\n\n7. In logic, if A and B are true, then B is true on its own. This is known as the simplification rule of inference.\n\n8. Therefore, we can safely infer \"The election might require a recount\" from the original statement, as it's explicitly stated and not contradicted by any other part of the statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
