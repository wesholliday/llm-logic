            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\"\n   b) \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n   - The splat must be quanked\n   OR\n   - The splat is morphed\n\n3. The second statement directly negates the first part of the disjunction. It tells us that \"The splat must be quanked\" is false.\n\n4. In a logical disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n5. Since we know that \"The splat must be quanked\" is false, and the original disjunction is presented as a fact, we can conclude that the other part, \"The splat is morphed,\" must be true.\n\n6. This is an application of a rule in propositional logic called \"disjunctive syllogism\" or sometimes \"process of elimination.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The splat is morphed.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
