            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either the sprocket must be daggled or it is cranked\"\n   b) \"It's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the sprocket must be daggled, or it is cranked, or both.\n\n3. The second statement negates one part of the disjunction. It tells us that it's not true that the sprocket must be daggled.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as disjunctive syllogism. When we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n5. Since we know that it's not the case that the sprocket must be daggled (negating the first part of the disjunction), the only remaining possibility to make the original statement true is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
