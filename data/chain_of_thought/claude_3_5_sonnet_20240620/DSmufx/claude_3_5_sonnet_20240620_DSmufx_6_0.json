            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed\"\n   b) \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n   - The grommet must be plopped\n   OR\n   - The grommet is sploffed\n\n3. The second statement directly negates the first part of the disjunction. It tells us that \"The grommet must be plopped\" is false.\n\n4. In a logical disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n5. Since we know that \"The grommet must be plopped\" is false, and the original disjunction is presented as a fact, we can conclude that the other part, \"The grommet is sploffed\", must be true.\n\n6. This is an application of the logical rule called \"disjunctive syllogism\" or sometimes \"process of elimination\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
