            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" This is of the form \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\n3. In logic, this second statement is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\n4. It's important to note that in logic, the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. They can have different truth values.\n\n5. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   - The car could be not red, and the truck could still be blue.\n   - The car could be not red, and the truck could be not blue.\n\n6. The original statement doesn't tell us anything about what color the truck is when the car is not red. It only tells us what happens when the car is red.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse from the original statement. The inverse may or may not be true, but it doesn't necessarily follow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
