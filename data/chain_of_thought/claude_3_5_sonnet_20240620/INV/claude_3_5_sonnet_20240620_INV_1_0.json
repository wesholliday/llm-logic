            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, of the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider the possibilities:\n   - Mary at wedding, Sue at wedding (matches original statement)\n   - Mary at wedding, Sue not at wedding (contradicts original statement)\n   - Mary not at wedding, Sue at wedding (doesn't contradict original statement)\n   - Mary not at wedding, Sue not at wedding (doesn't contradict original statement)\n\n5. The original statement only tells us what happens if Mary is at the wedding. It doesn't give us any information about what happens if Mary is not at the wedding.\n\n6. Sue could still be at the wedding even if Mary is not there, and this wouldn't contradict the original statement.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that Sue is not at the wedding just because Mary is not there.\n\nAnswer: no"
