            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true when the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   a) The doll is plastic and the truck is metal (satisfies the original statement)\n   b) The doll is not plastic and the truck is metal (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   c) The doll is not plastic and the truck is not metal (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   d) The doll is plastic and the truck is not metal (contradicts the original statement)\n\n5. As we can see, even when the doll is not plastic (cases b and c), the truck can still be metal or not metal. The original statement doesn't give us any information about what happens when the doll is not plastic.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
