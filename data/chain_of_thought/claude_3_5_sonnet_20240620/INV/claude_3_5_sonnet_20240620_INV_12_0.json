            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. To illustrate this, let's consider some possibilities:\n   a) Joe went to the park and Lucy went to the zoo (satisfies the original statement)\n   b) Joe didn't go to the park and Lucy went to the zoo (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   c) Joe didn't go to the park and Lucy didn't go to the zoo (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   d) Joe went to the park and Lucy didn't go to the zoo (contradicts the original statement)\n\n5. As we can see, even if Joe didn't go to the park (not P), Lucy could still have gone to the zoo. The original statement doesn't say anything about what happens if Joe doesn't go to the park.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one. The inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
