            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\" This is of the form \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\n3. In logic, this second statement is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\n4. It's important to note that in logic, the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. They can have different truth values.\n\n5. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   - The original statement allows for the possibility that Erin took a train even if Sam didn't take a plane.\n   - It also allows for the possibility that Sam didn't take a plane and Erin didn't take a train.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us what happens if Sam took a plane. It doesn't give us any information about what happens if Sam didn't take a plane.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the original statement. It would be an invalid logical inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
