            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider the possibilities:\n   - The vampire is awake: According to the original statement, the mummy must be awake.\n   - The vampire is not awake: The original statement doesn't tell us anything about this situation. The mummy could be awake or not awake.\n\n5. To illustrate this, let's use a similar example:\n   \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n   This doesn't mean that \"If it's not raining, then the ground is not wet.\"\n   The ground could be wet for other reasons (like a sprinkler).\n\n6. Similarly, the mummy could be awake for reasons unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: no"
