            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Consider these possibilities:\n   - James might write only mystery novels (as per the original statement).\n   - But other authors might also write mystery novels.\n   - There might be mystery novels not written by James.\n\n5. The original statement doesn't exclude the possibility of mystery novels written by other authors.\n\n6. Therefore, even if a book is not written by James, it could still be a mystery novel.\n\n7. The inverse statement is making an assumption that isn't supported by the original statement.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: no"
