            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true when the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   a) Jeff played basketball and Amy played tennis (original statement holds)\n   b) Jeff didn't play basketball and Amy played tennis (doesn't contradict the original)\n   c) Jeff didn't play basketball and Amy didn't play tennis (doesn't contradict the original)\n   d) Jeff played basketball and Amy didn't play tennis (contradicts the original)\n\n5. The original statement only tells us what happens if Jeff plays basketball. It doesn't give us any information about what happens if Jeff doesn't play basketball.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer anything about Amy's tennis playing when Jeff doesn't play basketball.\n\n7. The inverse statement is not a valid logical inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
