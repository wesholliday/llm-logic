            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider the possibilities:\n   - Alex finished and Chris finished (consistent with the original statement)\n   - Alex finished and Chris didn't finish (contradicts the original statement)\n   - Alex didn't finish and Chris finished (consistent with the original statement)\n   - Alex didn't finish and Chris didn't finish (consistent with the original statement)\n\n5. The original statement only rules out the second possibility. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Alex doesn't finish.\n\n6. Chris could still finish the race even if Alex didn't finish. The original statement doesn't exclude this possibility.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"If Alex didn't finish the race, then Chris didn't finish the race\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
