            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n   This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, of the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. To illustrate this, let's consider some possibilities:\n   - The griffin is in the forest, and the unicorn is in the forest (satisfies the original statement)\n   - The griffin is not in the forest, and the unicorn is in the forest (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   - The griffin is not in the forest, and the unicorn is not in the forest (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n\n5. As we can see, even if the griffin is not in the forest, the unicorn could still be in the forest without contradicting the original statement.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us what must be true if the griffin is in the forest. It doesn't give us any information about what happens if the griffin is not in the forest.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: no"
