            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   a) Tom watched football and Jen watched basketball (satisfies the original statement)\n   b) Tom didn't watch football and Jen watched basketball (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   c) Tom didn't watch football and Jen didn't watch basketball (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   d) Tom watched football and Jen didn't watch basketball (contradicts the original statement)\n\n5. As we can see, even if Tom didn't watch football (not A), Jen could still have watched basketball (B). This scenario (possibility b) doesn't contradict the original statement but does contradict the inverse.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the original statement. The inverse may or may not be true based on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
