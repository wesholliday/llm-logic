            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\" This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true when the original statement is true. This is a common logical fallacy.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   - The shirt could be cotton and the pants denim (satisfies the original statement)\n   - The shirt could be not cotton and the pants still denim (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   - The shirt could be not cotton and the pants not denim (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   - The only case that would contradict the original statement is if the shirt is cotton and the pants are not denim\n\n5. As we can see, there are cases where the shirt is not cotton, but the pants could still be denim. This means we cannot infer that if the shirt is not cotton, the pants are definitely not denim.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us what happens when the shirt is cotton. It doesn't give us any information about what happens when the shirt is not cotton.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
