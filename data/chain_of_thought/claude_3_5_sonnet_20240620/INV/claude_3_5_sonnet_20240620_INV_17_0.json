            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true when the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   a) Ben ate pasta and Kate ate salad (original statement holds)\n   b) Ben didn't eat pasta and Kate ate salad (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   c) Ben didn't eat pasta and Kate didn't eat salad (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   d) Ben ate pasta and Kate didn't eat salad (contradicts the original statement)\n\n5. As we can see, even if the original statement is true, there are scenarios (like b) where Ben didn't eat pasta, but Kate still ate salad.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
