            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" This is of the form \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\n3. In logic, this second statement is known as the \"inverse\" of the original statement.\n\n4. It's important to understand that in logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n5. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   - The apple could be green and the banana yellow.\n   - The apple could be red and the banana yellow.\n   - The apple could be red and the banana green.\n   - The apple could be green and the banana green.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us what happens when the apple is red. It doesn't give us any information about what happens when the apple is not red.\n\n7. Therefore, we can't conclude anything about the banana's color when the apple is not red based solely on the given statement.\n\n8. Making such an inference would be a logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\"\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
