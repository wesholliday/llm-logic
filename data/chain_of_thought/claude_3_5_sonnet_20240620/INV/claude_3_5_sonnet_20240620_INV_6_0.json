            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If Sue did not choose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. To illustrate this, let's consider some possibilities:\n   a) Sue chose pizza, Bob chose pasta (satisfies the original statement)\n   b) Sue chose pizza, Bob did not choose pasta (contradicts the original statement)\n   c) Sue did not choose pizza, Bob chose pasta (does not contradict the original statement)\n   d) Sue did not choose pizza, Bob did not choose pasta (does not contradict the original statement)\n\n5. As we can see, both (c) and (d) are possible scenarios that don't contradict the original statement. This means that even if Sue did not choose pizza, Bob might or might not have chosen pasta.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us what happens if Sue chooses pizza; it doesn't give us any information about what happens if Sue doesn't choose pizza.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
