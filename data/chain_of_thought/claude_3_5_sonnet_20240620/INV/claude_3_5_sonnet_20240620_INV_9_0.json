            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   a) Lisa bought the red shirt, and Mark bought the blue shirt. (Fits the original statement)\n   b) Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, and Mark bought the blue shirt. (Doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   c) Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, and Mark didn't buy the blue shirt. (Doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   d) Lisa bought the red shirt, and Mark didn't buy the blue shirt. (Contradicts the original statement)\n\n5. As we can see, even if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt (b and c), Mark could have still bought the blue shirt or not. The original statement doesn't give us any information about what happens if Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: no"
