This statement presents two possibilities for what the frazzle must be: either frazzle or gribble.\n3. The statement uses \"or,\" which means at least one of these options must be true, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of both being true.\n4. The question asks if we can infer \"The frazzle must be frazzle\" from this statement.\n5. While the original statement allows for the possibility that the frazzle is frazzle, it doesn't guarantee it.\n6. The frazzle could potentially be gribble instead, based on the original statement.\n7. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the frazzle must be frazzle, as it could also be gribble according to the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
