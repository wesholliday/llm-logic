            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" suggests uncertainty about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\n2. This statement implies that there's a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n3. If there's a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding, then it cannot be true that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\n4. The phrase \"must have been\" indicates necessity or certainty, which contradicts the uncertainty expressed in the original statement.\n\n5. The question asks if we can infer that \"it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\n\n6. Since the original statement allows for the possibility of Mary's absence, it directly contradicts any claim of certainty about her presence.\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically infer that it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
