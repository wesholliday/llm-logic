            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" suggests uncertainty about the toy's location.\n\n2. This statement allows for the possibility that the toy could be somewhere other than the toy box.\n\n3. If we say \"the toy must be in the toy box,\" we are expressing certainty about the toy's location.\n\n4. The original statement contradicts this certainty by introducing doubt.\n\n5. When we ask if \"it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box,\" we're essentially asking if we can rule out the certainty of the toy being in the box.\n\n6. Given that the original statement expresses uncertainty, we can indeed rule out the certainty of the toy's location in the box.\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically infer that it's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
