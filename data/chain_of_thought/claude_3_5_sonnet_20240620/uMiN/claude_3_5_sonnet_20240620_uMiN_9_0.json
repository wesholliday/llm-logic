            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The statement \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" implies uncertainty about whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not.\n\n2. This statement allows for two possibilities:\n   a) Lisa did not buy the red shirt\n   b) Lisa did buy the red shirt\n\n3. The phrase \"might not\" indicates that there's a possibility she didn't buy it, but it doesn't rule out the possibility that she did.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the phrase \"Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\" This statement implies certainty that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n5. If it were true that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, there would be no uncertainty about it.\n\n6. However, the original statement introduces uncertainty with \"might not.\"\n\n7. Therefore, the existence of uncertainty (might not) contradicts the notion of certainty (must have).\n\n8. We can conclude that if Lisa might not have bought the red shirt, then it cannot be the case that she must have bought it.\n\n9. The question asks if we can infer that it's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt, which aligns with our reasoning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
