            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The statement \"The griffin might not have been in the forest\" suggests uncertainty about the griffin's presence in the forest.\n\n2. This statement allows for the possibility that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\n3. If something might not be true, it means it's not necessarily true.\n\n4. The phrase \"it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest\" is equivalent to saying \"it's not necessary that the griffin was in the forest.\"\n\n5. The original statement already implies that it's not necessary for the griffin to have been in the forest, since it might not have been there.\n\n6. Therefore, we can logically infer that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\n\n7. The original statement and the inference are essentially saying the same thing, just in different ways.\n\nAnswer: yes"
