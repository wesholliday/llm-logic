            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The statement says \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair.\"\n2. This implies there's a possibility that the jacket is not on the chair.\n3. If something might not be the case, it means it's not certain or necessary.\n4. The phrase \"must be\" indicates certainty or necessity.\n5. If something might not be true, then it cannot simultaneously be something that must be true.\n6. Therefore, if the jacket might not be draped over the chair, it cannot be the case that it must be draped over the chair.\n7. The question asks if we can infer that it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n8. Based on our reasoning, we can indeed make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
