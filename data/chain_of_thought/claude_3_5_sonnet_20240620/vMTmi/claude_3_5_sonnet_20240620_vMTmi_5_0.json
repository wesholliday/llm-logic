            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\n   Premise 2: Amy might not have played tennis\n   Conclusion: Jeff did not play basketball\n\n2. We need to determine if this argument form is logically valid. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises, assuming the premises are true.\n\n3. Let's examine the first premise. It's in the form of \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = Jeff played basketball\n   Q = Amy must have played tennis\n\n4. The second premise states that Amy might not have played tennis. This is equivalent to saying that it's not certain that Amy played tennis.\n\n5. In logic, if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must be false. This is known as modus tollens.\n\n6. However, in this case, we don't know for certain that Q (Amy played tennis) is false. We only know that it might be false.\n\n7. The conclusion states definitively that Jeff did not play basketball. But based on our premises, we can't be certain of this.\n\n8. If Amy definitely did not play tennis, then we could conclude that Jeff did not play basketball. But since we only know that Amy might not have played tennis, we can't make a definitive conclusion about Jeff.\n\n9. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premises. There's a possibility, based on these premises, that Amy did play tennis and Jeff did play basketball.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
