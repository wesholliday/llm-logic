            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n   Premise 2: Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n   Conclusion: Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n2. We can represent this symbolically:\n   Let M = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   Let S = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n   \n   Premise 1: M \u2192 S (If M, then S)\n   Premise 2: \u25c7\u00acS (It's possible that not S)\n   Conclusion: \u00acM (Not M)\n\n3. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens with a modal operator. However, the standard Modus Tollens would require the second premise to be a definite statement (\u00acS), not a possibility (\u25c7\u00acS).\n\n4. The problem lies in the second premise. \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" is not the same as \"Sue was not at the wedding.\" It only suggests a possibility, not a certainty.\n\n5. In modal logic, from \"possibly not S\" we cannot conclude \"not S\". The possibility of Sue's absence doesn't guarantee her absence.\n\n6. Therefore, even if Mary's presence necessitates Sue's presence (Premise 1), and Sue's presence is uncertain (Premise 2), we cannot conclusively state that Mary was not present.\n\n7. For the argument to be valid, the second premise would need to be stronger: \"Sue was not at the wedding\" instead of \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\n8. As it stands, this argument commits the fallacy of denying the consequent with a modal weakening, which is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
