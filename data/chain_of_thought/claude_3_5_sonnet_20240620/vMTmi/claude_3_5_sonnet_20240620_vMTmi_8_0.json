            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n   Premise 2: The mummy might not have been awake.\n   Conclusion: The vampire was not awake.\n\n2. Let's translate this into logical symbols:\n   Let V = \"The vampire was awake\"\n   Let M = \"The mummy was awake\"\n   \n   Premise 1: V \u2192 M (If V, then M)\n   Premise 2: \u25c7\u00acM (It's possible that not M)\n   Conclusion: \u00acV (Not V)\n\n3. The form of this argument is similar to modus tollens, but with a key difference. Modus tollens would be:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n4. However, in this case, the second premise is not a definite \"Not M\", but rather \"It's possible that not M\".\n\n5. The possibility that the mummy was not awake does not necessarily mean that the mummy was definitely not awake. It only introduces uncertainty.\n\n6. For the argument to be valid, we would need the second premise to state definitively that the mummy was not awake, rather than just suggesting it might not have been awake.\n\n7. Because the second premise only states a possibility rather than a certainty, we cannot logically conclude with certainty that the vampire was not awake.\n\n8. Therefore, this argument form is not logically valid. It commits the fallacy of denying the consequent based on uncertain information.\n\nAnswer: no"
