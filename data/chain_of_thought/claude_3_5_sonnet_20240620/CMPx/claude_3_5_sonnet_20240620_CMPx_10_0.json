    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a fantole, a dribban, and a cruggit are the most downloaded fillip apps this month. Market watchers expect the fantole likely will retain the top spot in downloads, followed by the dribban, with the cruggit download rate significantly lower. These lead the downloads, so if the dribban isn\u2019t the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn\u2019t, the cruggit will be. Moreover, the fantole likely will lead downloads and hence the dribban likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the fantole isn\u2019t the most downloaded, the cruggit will be?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We have three apps: fantole, dribban, and cruggit.\n\n2. The current expectation is:\n   - Fantole will likely be the most downloaded\n   - Dribban will likely be second\n   - Cruggit will have significantly lower downloads\n\n3. We're told that if the dribban isn't the most downloaded, then if the fantole isn't, the cruggit will be. This is a logical statement about the relationship between these apps.\n\n4. We're also told that the fantole is likely to lead downloads, which means the dribban likely won't be the most downloaded.\n\n5. Now, let's consider the question: If the fantole isn't the most downloaded, will the cruggit likely be?\n\n6. Given the information in point 3, if the fantole isn't the most downloaded, and we know the dribban isn't (because fantole is likely to lead), then the cruggit must be.\n\n7. However, we need to consider the likelihood. The scenario where the fantole isn't the most downloaded is already unlikely, as it's expected to lead.\n\n8. In this unlikely scenario, the statement from point 3 becomes relevant, and it states definitively (not probabilistically) that the cruggit would be the most downloaded.\n\n9. Therefore, in the unlikely event that the fantole isn't the most downloaded, it does follow that the cruggit will be (not just likely, but certainly, based on the given information).\n\nAnswer: yes"
