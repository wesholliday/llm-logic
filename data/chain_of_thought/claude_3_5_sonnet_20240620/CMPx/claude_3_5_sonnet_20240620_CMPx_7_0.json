    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a crastin, a nivet, and a jomial are the top bispets this breeding season. Breeders expect the crastin likely will birth the most offspring, followed by the nivet, with the jomial birthing many fewer. These lead in birthing, so if the nivet doesn\u2019t birth the most offspring, then if the crastin doesn\u2019t, the jomial will. Moreover, the crastin likely will lead births and hence the nivet likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the crastin doesn\u2019t lead births, the jomial will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We have three animals: crastin, nivet, and jomial.\n\n2. The expected order of offspring production is:\n   crastin > nivet > jomial\n\n3. We're told that these three lead in birthing, meaning no other animal will produce more offspring than these three.\n\n4. We're given two conditional statements:\n   a) If the nivet doesn't birth the most, then if the crastin doesn't, the jomial will.\n   b) The crastin likely will lead births, so the nivet likely won't.\n\n5. Now, let's consider the question: Is it likely that if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will?\n\n6. From statement (b), we know that the crastin is likely to lead in births. This means it's unlikely that the crastin won't lead.\n\n7. However, if we consider the unlikely scenario where the crastin doesn't lead, we need to determine what happens next.\n\n8. From statement (a), we know that if the nivet doesn't birth the most (which is likely, according to statement b), then if the crastin doesn't lead, the jomial will.\n\n9. Since we're in the scenario where the crastin doesn't lead, and we know the nivet likely won't lead (from statement b), the conditions of statement (a) are met.\n\n10. Therefore, in this unlikely scenario where the crastin doesn't lead, the jomial will indeed lead in births.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that it does follow that it's likely that, if the crastin doesn't lead births, the jomial will.\n\nAnswer: yes"
