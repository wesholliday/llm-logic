    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We have three applicants for one position (zulision): jantiz, cramen, and sulect.\n\n2. The order of qualification is: jantiz > cramen > sulect.\n\n3. We're told that if the cramen doesn't get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn't, the sulect will. This establishes a conditional relationship.\n\n4. We're also told that the jantiz is likely to get the position, which implies the cramen is unlikely to get it.\n\n5. Now, we need to consider the likelihood of the sulect getting the position if the jantiz doesn't.\n\n6. Given that the jantiz is the most qualified and likely to get the position, the scenario where the jantiz doesn't get it is already unlikely.\n\n7. In this unlikely scenario (jantiz not getting the position), we know from point 3 that if the cramen also doesn't get it, the sulect will.\n\n8. Since the cramen is already unlikely to get the position (as stated in point 4), in the event that the jantiz doesn't get it, it's still unlikely that the cramen would get it.\n\n9. Therefore, in the unlikely event that the jantiz doesn't get the position, it becomes highly likely that the sulect will get it, as both the jantiz and cramen would have to be passed over.\n\n10. Even though this entire scenario (jantiz not getting the position) is unlikely, within this scenario, it is likely that the sulect would get the position.\n\nAnswer: yes"
