            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n   b) The mummy was not awake.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n   This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   B = \"the mummy was awake\"\n\n3. We know from the second piece of information that the mummy was not awake. This means that B is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens or \"denying the consequent.\"\n\n5. To understand why this works, consider the contrapositive of the original statement:\n   \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n   This statement is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\n6. Since we know the mummy was not awake, and we have the statement \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake,\" we can conclude that the vampire was not awake.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
