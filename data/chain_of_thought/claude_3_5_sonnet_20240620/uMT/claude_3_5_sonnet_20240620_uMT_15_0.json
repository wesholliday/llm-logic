            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n   b) Erin did not take a train.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n3. We know from the second statement that Erin did not take a train.\n   This negates the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   - If Sam took a plane (A), then Erin took a train (B).\n   - We know Erin did not take a train (not B).\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane (not A).\n\n6. This logical deduction allows us to infer that Sam did not take a plane based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
