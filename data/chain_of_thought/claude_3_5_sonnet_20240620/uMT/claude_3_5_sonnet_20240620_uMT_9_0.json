            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B: Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B. We know for certain that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent.\" It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   - We have \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n   - We know Mark did not buy the blue shirt (B is false)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt (A must be false)\n\n6. This conclusion is valid because if Lisa had bought the red shirt, it would necessarily mean that Mark bought the blue shirt (according to the first statement). But we know Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, so Lisa couldn't have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
