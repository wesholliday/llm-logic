            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   b) The book is not a mystery novel.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the book was written by James\"\n   B = \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n3. The second statement directly tells us that B is false: \"The book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens or \"denying the consequent.\"\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - We know that if A is true, B must be true (from the first statement)\n   - We know that B is false (from the second statement)\n   - Therefore, A must be false\n\n6. Translating this back to our original terms:\n   - If the book was written by James, it would be a mystery novel\n   - The book is not a mystery novel\n   - Therefore, the book was not written by James\n\nSo, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
