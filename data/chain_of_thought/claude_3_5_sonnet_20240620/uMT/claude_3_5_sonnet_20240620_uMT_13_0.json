            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n   b) The truck was not blue.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the car was red\"\n   B = \"the truck was blue\"\n\n3. The second statement directly negates B, stating that \"the truck was not blue.\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which follows the structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If the car was red (P), then the truck was blue (Q)\n   The truck was not blue (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the car was not red (Not P)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid because if the initial condition were true (the car was red), it would necessitate the truck being blue. However, we know the truck was not blue, so the initial condition cannot be true.\n\n7. Thus, we can logically conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
