            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n   b) Amy did not play tennis.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Jeff played basketball\n   B: Amy played tennis\n\n3. We know that B is false because we're told that Amy did not play tennis.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens or \"denying the consequent.\"\n\n5. To understand why this works, consider that if A were true, B would have to be true according to the conditional statement. But we know B is false, so A cannot be true.\n\n6. Applying this to our situation:\n   - We know Amy did not play tennis (B is false)\n   - Therefore, Jeff must not have played basketball (A must be false)\n\n7. This conclusion aligns with the original conditional statement. If Jeff had played basketball, Amy would have played tennis, but we know she didn't.\n\nAnswer: yes"
