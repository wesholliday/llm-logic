            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n   b) Chris did not finish the race.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = Alex finished the race\n   B = Chris finished the race\n\n3. We know from the second piece of information that Chris did not finish the race. This means that B is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens or \"denying the consequent.\"\n\n5. To understand why this works, consider the contrapositive of the original statement:\n   \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n   This statement is logically equivalent to the original conditional statement.\n\n6. Since we know Chris did not finish the race, we can apply this contrapositive statement and conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
