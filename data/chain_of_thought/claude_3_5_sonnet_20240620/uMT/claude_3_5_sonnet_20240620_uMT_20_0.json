            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n   b) The banana was not yellow.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the apple was red\"\n   B = \"the banana was yellow\"\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B. We know for certain that the banana was not yellow.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent.\" It follows this structure:\n   If A, then B\n   Not B\n   Therefore, not A\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\n   The banana was not yellow\n   Therefore, the apple was not red\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. Since we know the banana was not yellow, and we were told that if the apple was red, the banana would be yellow, we can conclude that the apple must not have been red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
