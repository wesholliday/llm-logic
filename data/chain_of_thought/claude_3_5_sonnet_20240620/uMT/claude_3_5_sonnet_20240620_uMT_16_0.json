            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n   b) The pants were not denim.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the shirt was cotton\"\n   B = \"the pants were denim\"\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B: \"The pants were not denim.\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It follows this structure:\n   If A, then B.\n   Not B.\n   Therefore, not A.\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n   The pants were not denim.\n   Therefore, the shirt was not cotton.\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. If the pants were not denim, and we know that cotton shirts always lead to denim pants, then the shirt could not have been cotton.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
