            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n   b) Jen did not watch basketball.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Tom watched football\n   B: Jen watched basketball\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B in the conditional statement. We know for certain that Jen did not watch basketball.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent.\" It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   - We have \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\"\n   - We know that Jen did not watch basketball (B is false)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football (A must be false)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw a definitive conclusion about Tom's actions based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
