            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n   b) Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Joe went to the park\n   B: Lucy went to the zoo\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B in the conditional statement. We know for certain that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent.\" It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   - We know that if Joe went to the park (A), then Lucy went to the zoo (B).\n   - We also know that Lucy did not go to the zoo (not B).\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park (not A).\n\n6. This conclusion is valid because if Joe had gone to the park, it would necessarily mean that Lucy went to the zoo, which we know is not true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
