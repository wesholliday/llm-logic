            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n   b) The wolf was not in the den.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The bear was in the cave\n   B: The wolf was in the den\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B in the conditional statement.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as modus tollens (denying the consequent). It follows this structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If the bear was in the cave (P), then the wolf was in the den (Q)\n   The wolf was not in the den (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the bear was not in the cave (Not P)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. If the first statement is true (if bear in cave, then wolf in den) and we know for certain that the wolf is not in the den, then it must follow that the bear is not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"
