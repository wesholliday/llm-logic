            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n   b) The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement. It's in the form of \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The griffin was in the forest\n   B: The unicorn was in the forest\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B. We know for certain that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent.\" It states that if we have \"If A, then B\" and we know \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A.\"\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   - We have \"If griffin in forest, then unicorn in forest\"\n   - We know \"unicorn not in forest\"\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"griffin not in forest\"\n\n6. If the griffin were in the forest, it would necessitate the unicorn being in the forest according to the first statement. But we know the unicorn isn't in the forest, so the griffin can't be there either.\n\nGiven this logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
