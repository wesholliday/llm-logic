            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n   b) Bob did not choose pasta.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that \"Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n   This directly contradicts the consequent (B) in the conditional statement.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens.\n\n5. Applying this rule to our scenario:\n   - If A (Sue chose pizza), then B (Bob chose pasta)\n   - We know that B is false (Bob did not choose pasta)\n   - Therefore, A must also be false (Sue did not choose pizza)\n\n6. This logical deduction allows us to conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
