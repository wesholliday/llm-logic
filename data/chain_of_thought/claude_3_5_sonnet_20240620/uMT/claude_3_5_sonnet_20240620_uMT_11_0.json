            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n   b) The muffins were not blueberry.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the cake was chocolate\"\n   B = \"the muffins were blueberry\"\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B: \"The muffins were not blueberry.\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as modus tollens (denying the consequent). It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\"\n   - We know that B is false\n   - Therefore, A must also be false\n\n6. Translating this back to our original terms:\n   - If the cake was chocolate (A), then the muffins were blueberry (B)\n   - We know the muffins were not blueberry (not B)\n   - Therefore, the cake was not chocolate (not A)\n\nSo, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes"
