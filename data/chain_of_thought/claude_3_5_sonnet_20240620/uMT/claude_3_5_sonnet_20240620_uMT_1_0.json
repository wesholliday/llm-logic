            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = Mary was at the wedding\n   B = Sue was at the wedding\n\n3. We know from the second piece of information that Sue was not at the wedding. This means that B is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens or \"denying the consequent.\"\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - If A is true (Mary was at the wedding), then B must be true (Sue was at the wedding).\n   - But we know B is false (Sue was not at the wedding).\n   - Therefore, A must also be false (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\n6. If Mary had been at the wedding, it would contradict the given information, because Sue would have had to be there too, but we know Sue wasn't there.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
