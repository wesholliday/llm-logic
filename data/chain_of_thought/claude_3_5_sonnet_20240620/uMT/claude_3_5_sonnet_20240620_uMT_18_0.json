            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n   b) The truck was not metal.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the doll was plastic\"\n   B = \"the truck was metal\"\n\n3. We're also told that \"The truck was not metal.\" This is the negation of B.\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called \"modus tollens\" which states:\n   If we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A.\"\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   We have \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (If A, then B)\n   And we have \"The truck was not metal\" (not B)\n   Therefore, we can conclude \"The doll was not plastic\" (not A)\n\n6. This logical deduction is valid and allows us to infer that the doll was indeed not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
