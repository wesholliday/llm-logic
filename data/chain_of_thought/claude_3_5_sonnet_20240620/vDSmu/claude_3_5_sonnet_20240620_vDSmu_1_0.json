            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze this argument step by step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: Either A or B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Therefore, A\n\n   Where A = \"Fido is inside\" and B = \"Fido must be in the garden\"\n\n2. This argument form is known as the disjunctive syllogism or the process of elimination.\n\n3. The first premise presents two options as an exclusive disjunction (either/or). This means that one of these options must be true, and they cannot both be false.\n\n4. The second premise eliminates one of these options by stating that it is not the case.\n\n5. Given that one of the options must be true (from premise 1) and one option has been eliminated (in premise 2), the only remaining possibility is that the other option must be true.\n\n6. This reasoning process is logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true. There is no possible scenario where both premises could be true and the conclusion false.\n\n7. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on the actual truth of the premises or conclusion, but on the form of the argument. Even if Fido is actually somewhere else entirely, the argument form itself is still valid.\n\n8. This argument form works regardless of the specific content. We could replace \"Fido is inside\" and \"Fido must be in the garden\" with any other propositions, and the logical structure would remain valid.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
