            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or the CEO.\"\n\n2. This statement uses the logical operator \"or,\" which means that at least one of the conditions must be true.\n\n3. The \"must have been\" applies to both parts of the statement, as it's distributed across the \"or\" clause.\n\n4. So, we can break it down into two possible scenarios:\n   a) The contract must have been approved by the legal team\n   b) The contract must have been approved by the CEO\n\n5. The proposed inference is: \"The contract must have been approved by the legal team or it must have been approved by the CEO.\"\n\n6. This inference explicitly states the two scenarios we derived from the original statement.\n\n7. The meaning of the original statement and the inferred statement are logically equivalent. Both indicate that at least one of the two approvals (legal team or CEO) must have occurred.\n\n8. The only difference is that the inferred statement repeats \"must have been approved\" for clarity, but this doesn't change the logical meaning of the statement.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the inferred statement is a valid logical equivalent of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
