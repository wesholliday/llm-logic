            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The software must have been installed on the computer or accessed through the cloud.\"\n\n2. The inferred statement is: \"The software must have been installed on the computer or it must have been accessed through the cloud.\"\n\n3. Both statements present two possibilities for the software: being installed on the computer or being accessed through the cloud.\n\n4. The key difference is the repetition of \"must have been\" in the second part of the inferred statement.\n\n5. In the original statement, \"must have been\" applies to both parts of the sentence due to the structure of the sentence. It's implied that the software \"must have been\" either installed or accessed.\n\n6. The inferred statement makes this implication explicit by repeating \"must have been\" (in the form of \"it must have been\") for the second part.\n\n7. This repetition doesn't change the meaning of the statement. It merely emphasizes that the necessity applies to both options.\n\n8. The logical content of both statements is identical. They both assert that one of the two conditions must be true: either the software was installed on the computer, or it was accessed through the cloud.\n\n9. Therefore, the inferred statement is a valid logical inference from the original statement. It doesn't add or remove any information; it only restates the same logical content in a slightly more explicit way.\n\nAnswer: yes"
