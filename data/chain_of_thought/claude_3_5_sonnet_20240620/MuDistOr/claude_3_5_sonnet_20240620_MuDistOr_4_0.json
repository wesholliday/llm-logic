            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The keys must have been in the drawer or on the hook.\"\n\n2. This statement uses the modal verb \"must,\" which indicates a strong logical necessity or certainty.\n\n3. The statement presents two possible locations for the keys: in the drawer or on the hook.\n\n4. The use of \"or\" indicates that at least one of these locations is true, but it doesn't exclude the possibility of both being true.\n\n5. The proposed inference is: \"The keys must have been in the drawer or they must have been on the hook.\"\n\n6. This inference maintains the same two possible locations for the keys.\n\n7. However, it repeats the modal verb \"must\" for each location separately.\n\n8. This repetition of \"must\" for each option doesn't change the logical meaning of the statement. It still expresses the same level of certainty about the keys being in one of these two locations.\n\n9. The inference doesn't add any new information or change the logical relationship between the two possibilities.\n\n10. Therefore, the meaning of the original statement and the inferred statement are logically equivalent.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the inference is valid and does not alter the meaning of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
