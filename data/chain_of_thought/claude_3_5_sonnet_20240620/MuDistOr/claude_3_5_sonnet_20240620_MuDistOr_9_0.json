            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The package must have been delivered by truck or by plane.\"\n\n2. This statement uses the word \"must,\" which indicates certainty or necessity. It's saying that one of these two methods of delivery (truck or plane) definitely occurred.\n\n3. The word \"or\" in this context is inclusive, meaning it could be one or the other, or potentially both (although in practical terms, it's unlikely a package would be delivered by both truck and plane).\n\n4. The proposed inference is: \"The package must have been delivered by truck or it must have been delivered by plane.\"\n\n5. This inference maintains the same meaning as the original statement. It still expresses certainty (\"must\") and presents the two options (truck or plane) as the only possibilities.\n\n6. The only difference is that the second statement repeats the word \"must\" for each option, which doesn't change the logical meaning of the statement.\n\n7. Both statements are logically equivalent. They both assert that the package was definitely delivered by either truck or plane (or both), with no other possibilities allowed.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the proposed inference is a valid logical equivalent of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
