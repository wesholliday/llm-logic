            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". This means that whenever A is true, B must also be true. However, it doesn't necessarily mean that if B is true, A must be true.\n\n3. We know that Sue was at the wedding (B is true). But this doesn't automatically mean that Mary was at the wedding (A is true).\n\n4. Consider the possibilities:\n   - Mary could have been at the wedding, and Sue was there too (consistent with both given statements).\n   - Mary could have not been at the wedding, but Sue was still there (also consistent with both given statements).\n\n5. The conditional statement only tells us what must happen if Mary is at the wedding, but it doesn't tell us anything about whether Mary must be at the wedding if Sue is there.\n\n6. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\". Just because the consequent (Sue being at the wedding) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) is true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclude with certainty that Mary was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: no"
