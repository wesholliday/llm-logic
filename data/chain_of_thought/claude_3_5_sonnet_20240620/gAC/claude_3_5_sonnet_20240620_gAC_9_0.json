            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". In this case:\n   A = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B is true (Mark did buy the blue shirt).\n\n4. However, we need to be careful here. The conditional statement only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. It doesn't work in reverse.\n\n5. In logical terms, we can conclude B from A, but we cannot necessarily conclude A from B. This is because there might be other reasons why B is true that don't involve A.\n\n6. For example, Mark might have bought the blue shirt regardless of what Lisa did. The conditional statement doesn't exclude this possibility.\n\n7. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\" - assuming that because the \"then\" part of an \"if-then\" statement is true, the \"if\" part must also be true.\n\n8. Therefore, while we know Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based solely on the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
