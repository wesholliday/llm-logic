            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". It doesn't necessarily mean that B implies A.\n\n3. In logical terms, we can write this as: A \u2192 B (where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\")\n\n4. The second statement confirms that B is true (Mark did buy the blue shirt).\n\n5. However, just because B is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that A is true. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\".\n\n6. To illustrate this, consider an alternative scenario: It's possible that Mark bought the blue shirt for reasons unrelated to Lisa's purchase. Lisa might not have bought the red shirt at all.\n\n7. The original statement only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt, but it doesn't say anything about what happens if she doesn't buy it.\n\n8. Therefore, while we know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark definitely bought the blue shirt, we cannot conclude the reverse from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
