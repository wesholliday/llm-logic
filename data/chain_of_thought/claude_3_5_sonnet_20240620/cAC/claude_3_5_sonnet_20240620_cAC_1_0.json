            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". It doesn't say anything about what happens if B is true.\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B (Sue was at the wedding) is true.\n\n4. However, the conditional statement doesn't work in reverse. It doesn't say \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\n5. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because the consequent (Sue being at the wedding) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) is true.\n\n6. For example, it's possible that Sue attended the wedding independently of Mary, and Mary wasn't there at all.\n\n7. The only conclusion we can draw from these statements is that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue would have been there too. But we can't conclude anything about Mary's presence based on Sue's attendance.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
