            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The room must have been cleaned daily.\"\n2. The proposed inference is \"The room must have been cleaned daily or as requested.\"\n3. In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B, because if A is true, then \"A or B\" is always true regardless of whether B is true or false. This is known as the law of disjunction introduction.\n4. In this case, \"The room must have been cleaned daily\" is our A, and \"as requested\" is our B.\n5. Therefore, if the room must have been cleaned daily, it logically follows that it must have been cleaned daily OR as requested (or both).\n6. The addition of \"or as requested\" doesn't change the truth of the original statement; it merely adds an alternative that doesn't contradict or weaken the original claim.\n7. It's important to note that this inference doesn't imply that cleaning \"as requested\" actually occurred; it's just a logical extension that doesn't violate the original statement.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer the proposed statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
