            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM.\"\n\n2. The statement we're trying to infer is: \"The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM or been rescheduled.\"\n\n3. In logic, there's a principle called \"disjunction introduction.\" This principle states that if A is true, then \"A or B\" is also true, regardless of whether B is true or false.\n\n4. In this case, \"The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM\" is our A, and \"been rescheduled\" is our B.\n\n5. Even if we don't know anything about whether the meeting was rescheduled or not, we can still add this possibility to our original statement without making it false.\n\n6. If the original statement is true, then the new statement that includes an additional possibility (rescheduling) must also be true.\n\n7. Therefore, the second statement is a logical inference from the first statement. It doesn't add any new information that contradicts the original statement; it only adds a possibility that doesn't affect the truth of the original claim.\n\nAnswer: yes"
