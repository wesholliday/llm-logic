            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The application must have been completed online.\"\n\n2. The inferred statement is: \"The application must have been completed online or submitted electronically.\"\n\n3. We need to determine if the second statement logically follows from the first.\n\n4. The key difference between the two statements is the addition of \"or submitted electronically\" in the second statement.\n\n5. In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B, because if A is true, then \"A or B\" is always true regardless of whether B is true or false. This is known as the law of disjunction introduction.\n\n6. In this case, \"completed online\" is our A, and \"submitted electronically\" is our B.\n\n7. \"Completed online\" is a specific form of electronic submission, so \"submitted electronically\" is actually a broader category that includes \"completed online.\"\n\n8. Therefore, if something must have been completed online, it necessarily must have also been submitted electronically.\n\n9. The addition of \"or submitted electronically\" does not change the truth value of the statement; it merely adds a redundant alternative that is already implied by the original statement.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that the second statement can indeed be inferred from the first statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
