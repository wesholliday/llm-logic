            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The project must have been completed by Friday.\"\n   This is a definitive statement with a specific deadline.\n\n2. The proposed inference is \"The project must have been completed by Friday or next week.\"\n   This statement provides two possible deadlines: Friday or next week.\n\n3. In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B, because if A is true, then \"A or B\" is always true, regardless of whether B is true or false. This is known as the rule of disjunction introduction.\n\n4. In this case, \"completed by Friday\" is our A, and \"completed by next week\" is our B.\n\n5. Since the original statement says the project must be completed by Friday, it logically follows that it must be completed by either Friday or any later time, including next week.\n\n6. The addition of \"or next week\" doesn't change the truth of the original statement; it merely adds an unnecessary alternative that doesn't contradict the original deadline.\n\n7. Therefore, while the inference is less precise than the original statement, it is still logically valid and can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
