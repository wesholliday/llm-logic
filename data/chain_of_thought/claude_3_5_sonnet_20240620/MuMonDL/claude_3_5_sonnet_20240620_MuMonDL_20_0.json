            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the statement \"The event must have been formal.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer \"The event must have been formal or black-tie\" from this statement.\n\n3. In logic, there's a rule called \"disjunction introduction\" or \"logical addition.\" This rule states that if A is true, then \"A or B\" is also true, regardless of whether B is true or false.\n\n4. In this case, \"formal\" is A, and \"black-tie\" is B.\n\n5. Since we know the event was formal (A is true), we can logically conclude that \"The event was formal or black-tie\" is also true.\n\n6. The word \"must\" in both statements doesn't change this logical relationship.\n\n7. It's important to note that this inference doesn't suggest anything about whether the event was actually black-tie. It only states that at least one of the two conditions (formal or black-tie) was met, which we know is true because we're told it was formal.\n\n8. This inference is always valid, even if \"black-tie\" is a more specific or stricter dress code than \"formal.\"\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the statement \"The event must have been formal or black-tie\" from the original statement \"The event must have been formal.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
