            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The package must have been delivered today.\"\n   This is a definitive statement about the package being delivered specifically today.\n\n2. The proposed inference is: \"The package must have been delivered today or tomorrow.\"\n   This statement allows for the possibility of delivery either today or tomorrow.\n\n3. In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B. This is known as the rule of disjunction introduction or \"or-introduction.\"\n\n4. In this case, \"The package must have been delivered today\" is our A, and \"The package must have been delivered tomorrow\" is our B.\n\n5. Even though we know for certain (according to the original statement) that the package was delivered today, it's still logically valid to say it was delivered \"today or tomorrow\" because this broader statement includes the specific case we know to be true.\n\n6. It's important to note that while this inference is logically valid, it does introduce some ambiguity that wasn't present in the original statement. However, the question is about logical inference, not about maintaining the same level of specificity.\n\n7. Therefore, based on the rules of logical inference, we can indeed infer the proposed statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
