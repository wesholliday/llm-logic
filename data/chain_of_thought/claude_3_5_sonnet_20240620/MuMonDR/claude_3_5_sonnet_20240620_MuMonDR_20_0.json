            "content": "Explanation: Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The event must have been formal.\"\n2. This statement is very specific and definitive. It doesn't leave room for other possibilities.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The event must have been semi-formal or formal.\"\n4. This new statement is broader, as it includes two possibilities: semi-formal or formal.\n5. While the original statement is included in the inference (formal), the inference also allows for an additional possibility (semi-formal) that wasn't present in the original statement.\n6. In logic, if a statement is true, then any less specific statement that includes it must also be true.\n7. Therefore, if an event must have been formal, it's also true that it must have been either semi-formal or formal (even though we know it was specifically formal).\n\nThe inference is a logical expansion of the original statement. It's less specific but still true, as it includes the original condition (formal) along with an additional possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes"
