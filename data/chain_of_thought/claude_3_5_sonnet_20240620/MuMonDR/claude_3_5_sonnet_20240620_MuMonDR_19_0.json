This statement is very specific and restrictive. It only allows for one method of completing the application: online.\n3. The inferred statement is: \"The application must have been completed in person or online.\"\n4. This inferred statement is broader and less restrictive. It allows for two methods of completing the application: either in person or online.\n5. The original statement does not allow for any other option besides online completion.\n6. The inferred statement introduces an additional option (in-person completion) that was not present in the original statement.\n7. By introducing this additional option, the inferred statement actually contradicts the original statement, which specified that the application must have been completed online only.\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one. The inferred statement is actually less restrictive and includes possibilities not present in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
