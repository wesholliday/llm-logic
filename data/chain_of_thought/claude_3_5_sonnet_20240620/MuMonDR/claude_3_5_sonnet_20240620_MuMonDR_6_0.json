            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The concert must have been sold out.\" This is a definitive statement about the concert's ticket sales.\n\n2. The proposed inference is \"The concert must have been postponed or sold out.\" This statement presents two possibilities: either the concert was postponed OR it was sold out.\n\n3. In logic, when we have a statement \"A or B,\" it is true if either A is true, B is true, or both are true.\n\n4. We know for certain that the concert was sold out (from the original statement). This satisfies one part of the \"or\" statement in the inference.\n\n5. The fact that we know the concert was sold out doesn't give us any information about whether it was postponed or not. It could have been postponed as well, or it might not have been.\n\n6. However, even if we don't know about the postponement, the \"or\" statement is still true because we know one part of it (sold out) is definitely true.\n\n7. In logical terms, if we know A is true, then \"A or B\" must also be true, regardless of whether B is true or false.\n\n8. Therefore, based on the original statement, we can indeed infer the proposed statement, as it includes the known truth (sold out) as one of its possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes"
