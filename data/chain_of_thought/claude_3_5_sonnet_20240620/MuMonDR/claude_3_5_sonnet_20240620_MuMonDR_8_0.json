            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The restaurant must have been closed on Mondays.\"\n\n2. This is a definitive statement about the restaurant being closed on Mondays.\n\n3. The statement we're asked to infer is: \"The restaurant must have been open for limited hours or closed on Mondays.\"\n\n4. This second statement presents two possibilities: either limited hours or closed on Mondays.\n\n5. The original statement already confirms that the restaurant was closed on Mondays.\n\n6. Being closed is more restrictive than having limited hours, so it automatically satisfies the condition of the second statement.\n\n7. In logical terms, if A (closed on Mondays) is true, then \"A or B\" is always true, regardless of what B is.\n\n8. Therefore, the second statement, which includes being closed on Mondays as one of its possibilities, must be true if the first statement is true.\n\n9. We can confidently infer the second statement from the first, as it's a logical expansion that includes the original condition.\n\nAnswer: yes"
