            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The meeting must have been scheduled for 2 PM.\"\n   This is a definitive statement about the meeting's schedule.\n\n2. The proposed inference is: \"The meeting must have been cancelled or scheduled for 2 PM.\"\n   This statement presents two possibilities: cancellation or scheduling for 2 PM.\n\n3. In formal logic, this is an example of the logical rule called \"disjunction introduction\" or \"addition.\" This rule states that if A is true, then \"A or B\" is also true, regardless of whether B is true or false.\n\n4. In this case, if we know for certain that the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM (A), then logically, it must also be true that either the meeting was scheduled for 2 PM or it was cancelled (A or B).\n\n5. The original statement doesn't mention anything about cancellation, but the addition of this possibility in the inference doesn't contradict the original statement. It simply adds an alternative that may or may not be true.\n\n6. Therefore, while the inference adds information not present in the original statement, it does not contradict the original statement and is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
