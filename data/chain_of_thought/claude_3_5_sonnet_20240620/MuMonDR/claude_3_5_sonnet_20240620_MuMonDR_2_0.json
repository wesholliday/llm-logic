The original statement is \"The book must be on the shelf.\" This is a definitive statement about the book's location.\n\n2. The proposed inference is \"The book must be in the library or on the shelf.\" This statement presents two possible locations for the book.\n\n3. In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B, because if A is true, then \"A or B\" is always true regardless of whether B is true or false. This is known as the rule of disjunction introduction.\n\n4. In this case, \"The book must be on the shelf\" is our A, and \"The book must be in the library\" is our B.\n\n5. Since we know A is true (the book must be on the shelf), then \"A or B\" (the book must be on the shelf or in the library) must also be true, regardless of whether the book is actually in the library or not.\n\n6. It's important to note that while this inference is logically valid, it doesn't provide any additional information. The inferred statement is actually less specific than the original statement.\n\n7. However, from a purely logical standpoint, the inference is correct and can be made.\n\nAnswer: yes"
