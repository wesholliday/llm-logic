The statement we're trying to infer is \"The document must have been notarized or signed.\"\n3. In logic, when we have a statement \"A or B,\" it is true if either A is true, B is true, or both are true.\n4. In this case, we know for certain that the document was signed (from the original statement).\n5. The inferred statement gives two possibilities: notarized OR signed.\n6. Since we know the document was definitely signed, it doesn't matter whether it was notarized or not - the \"or\" statement will still be true.\n7. Even if we don't know anything about notarization, the fact that we know it was signed is enough to make the \"or\" statement true.\n8. Therefore, the original statement (document must have been signed) is sufficient to infer the new statement (document must have been notarized or signed).\n\nAnswer: yes"
