            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The room must have been cleaned daily.\"\n2. This statement implies a regular, consistent cleaning schedule that occurs every day.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The room must have been cleaned upon request or daily.\"\n4. This new statement presents two possibilities: cleaning upon request OR daily cleaning.\n5. The original statement already establishes that cleaning occurred daily.\n6. If something happens daily, it automatically includes any possible requests for cleaning, as it's already being done every day regardless of requests.\n7. Therefore, the proposed inference is actually less specific than the original statement, as it introduces an alternative (upon request) that isn't necessary given the daily cleaning.\n8. In logical terms, the original statement implies the proposed inference, but it's important to note that the inference is actually a weaker statement than the original.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that the proposed inference can indeed be drawn from the original statement, even though it's less specific.\n\nAnswer: yes"
