            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the splat must be quanked\"\n   b) \"Either the splat must be quanked or it is morphed\"\n\n2. Let's simplify statement (a):\n   \"The splat must not be quanked\"\n\n3. Statement (b) is a disjunction (either/or statement). It means one of the two options must be true.\n\n4. Given that we know from (a) that the splat must not be quanked, we can eliminate the first option in statement (b).\n\n5. In logical terms, if we have \"A or B\" and we know \"not A\", then B must be true.\n\n6. Therefore, since we know the splat must not be quanked, and we're given that either it must be quanked or it is morphed, we can conclude that it must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
