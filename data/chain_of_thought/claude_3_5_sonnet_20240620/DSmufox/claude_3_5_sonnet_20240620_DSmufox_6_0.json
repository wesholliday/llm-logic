            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\"\n   b) \"Either the grommet must be plopped or it is sploffed\"\n\n2. Let's simplify statement (a):\n   \"The grommet must not be plopped\"\n\n3. Statement (b) is a disjunction (an \"either/or\" statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true.\n\n4. Now, we can apply the logical rule of disjunctive syllogism. This rule states that if we have a disjunction (A or B) and we know that one of the options is false, then the other must be true.\n\n5. We know from statement (a) that \"The grommet must not be plopped\". This negates the first part of the disjunction in statement (b).\n\n6. Since the first part of the disjunction is false, and we know that at least one part must be true, we can conclude that the second part must be true.\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
