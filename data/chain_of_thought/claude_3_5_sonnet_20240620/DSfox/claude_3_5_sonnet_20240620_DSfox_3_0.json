            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"The splat is not quanked\"\n   b) \"Either the splat is quanked or it is morphed\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the splat is quanked, or it is morphed, or both.\n\n3. Statement (a) explicitly states that the splat is not quanked. This eliminates the first possibility in the disjunction.\n\n4. Since we know the splat is not quanked, and the disjunction states it must be either quanked or morphed, we can conclude that it must be morphed.\n\n5. This is an application of the logical rule called \"disjunctive syllogism\" or \"process of elimination\". If we have \"A or B\" and we know \"not A\", then B must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The splat is morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
