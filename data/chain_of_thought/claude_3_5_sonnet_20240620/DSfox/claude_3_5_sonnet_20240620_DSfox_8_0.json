We are given two statements:\n   a) The sprocket is not daggled.\n   b) Either the sprocket is daggled or it is cranked.\n\n2. Statement (b) is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the sprocket is daggled, or it is cranked, or both.\n\n3. Statement (a) explicitly states that the sprocket is not daggled. This eliminates the possibility of the sprocket being daggled.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the disjunction in statement (b) again:\n   - We know the sprocket is not daggled (from statement a)\n   - The disjunction states it must be either daggled or cranked\n   - Since it's not daggled, the only remaining possibility is that it must be cranked\n\n5. This is an example of disjunctive syllogism, a valid form of logical reasoning:\n   - Either A or B\n   - Not A\n   - Therefore, B\n\n6. Given that one part of the disjunction is false (the sprocket is not daggled), the other part must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\nTherefore, we can logically conclude that the sprocket must be cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
