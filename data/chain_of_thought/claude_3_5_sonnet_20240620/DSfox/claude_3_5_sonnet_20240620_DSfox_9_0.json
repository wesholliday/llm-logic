We have two given statements:\n   a) The twonk is not plinked.\n   b) Either the twonk is plinked or it is varnished.\n\n2. Statement (b) is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true.\n\n3. From statement (a), we know that \"The twonk is plinked\" is false.\n\n4. In the disjunction (b), if one part is false, the other must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n5. Since we know \"The twonk is plinked\" is false, the other part of the disjunction, \"it is varnished,\" must be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"The twonk is varnished.\"\n\nThis is a valid logical inference based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
