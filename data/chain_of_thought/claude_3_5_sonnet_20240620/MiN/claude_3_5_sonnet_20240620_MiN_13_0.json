            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The toy might not be in the toy box.\"\n   This suggests there's a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\n2. The statement we're trying to infer is \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\"\n   This is essentially saying that it's not a certainty or requirement for the toy to be in the toy box.\n\n3. Let's consider the logical implications:\n   - If the toy might not be in the toy box, it means there's a possibility it's elsewhere.\n   - If there's a possibility it's elsewhere, then it can't be true that the toy must always be in the toy box.\n\n4. The original statement allows for two possibilities:\n   a) The toy is in the toy box\n   b) The toy is not in the toy box\n\n5. The statement we're trying to infer also allows for these same two possibilities by negating the necessity of the toy being in the box.\n\n6. Therefore, the original statement logically implies the statement we're trying to infer. If it might not be in the box, then it's not the case that it must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
