            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This implies uncertainty about Mary's presence at the wedding.\n   - It suggests there's a possibility that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n2. The statement we're trying to infer is \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\n   - This is essentially saying that Mary's presence at the wedding was not a certainty or a necessity.\n\n3. Let's consider the logical implications:\n   - If Mary might not have been at the wedding, it means there's a possibility of her absence.\n   - If there's a possibility of her absence, then her presence cannot be a certainty or a necessity.\n\n4. The phrase \"might not have been\" directly contradicts \"must have been\":\n   - \"Might not\" implies possibility of absence.\n   - \"Must have\" implies certainty of presence.\n\n5. Therefore, if it's true that Mary might not have been at the wedding, it logically follows that it cannot be the case that she must have been there.\n\n6. The original statement and the inferred statement are logically consistent and the latter can be derived from the former.\n\nAnswer: yes"
