            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The book might not have been written by James.\"\n   This implies uncertainty about the authorship of the book.\n\n2. The word \"might\" indicates a possibility, not a certainty. It leaves room for both options: James could be the author, or he might not be.\n\n3. The statement we're asked to infer is \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\"\n   This statement denies the necessity of James being the author.\n\n4. If we compare the two statements:\n   - The original allows for the possibility that James is not the author.\n   - The inferred statement denies the certainty that James is the author.\n\n5. Both statements are essentially saying the same thing, just in different ways:\n   - \"Might not be\" (original) is logically equivalent to \"not must be\" (inferred).\n\n6. If it's possible that James didn't write the book (original statement), then it cannot be true that James must have written the book (inferred statement).\n\n7. Therefore, the inferred statement logically follows from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
