            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\"\n   - This implies uncertainty about whether Lisa bought the red shirt.\n   - It suggests there's a possibility that she didn't buy it.\n\n2. The phrase \"might not\" indicates a possibility, not a certainty.\n   - It leaves open both the possibility that she bought the shirt and that she didn't.\n\n3. Now, let's consider the inference: \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\"\n   - This statement denies the necessity of Lisa buying the red shirt.\n   - It suggests that there are other possibilities besides Lisa definitely buying the shirt.\n\n4. Comparing the two statements:\n   - The original statement allows for the possibility that Lisa didn't buy the shirt.\n   - The inference also allows for the possibility that Lisa didn't buy the shirt.\n\n5. Logical relationship:\n   - If something \"might not\" be the case, then it cannot be said that it \"must\" be the case.\n   - \"Might not\" and \"must\" are incompatible \u2013 if something might not happen, it cannot be a necessity.\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   - The original statement implies uncertainty, which is consistent with the inference that it's not a necessity.\n   - Therefore, we can logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
