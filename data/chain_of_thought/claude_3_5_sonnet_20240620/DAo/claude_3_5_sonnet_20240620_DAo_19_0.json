            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) Tom did not watch football\n   b) If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = Tom watched football\n   Q = Jen watched basketball\n\n3. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q. This situation is called the \"fallacy of denying the antecedent.\"\n\n4. In our case, we know that Tom did not watch football (P is false). Therefore, we cannot make any definitive conclusion about whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\n5. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if Tom watched football. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when Tom doesn't watch football.\n\n6. Jen may or may not have watched basketball for reasons unrelated to Tom's football watching. We simply don't have enough information to determine this.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"Jen did not watch basketball\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
