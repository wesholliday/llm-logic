            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) Jeff did not play basketball\n   b) If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"Jeff played basketball\"\n   Q = \"Amy played tennis\"\n\n3. In logic, we cannot directly conclude anything about Q when P is false. This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens when P is true, not when it's false.\n\n4. In this case, we know that P is false (Jeff did not play basketball), but this doesn't give us any information about whether Amy played tennis or not.\n\n5. The conditional statement doesn't say anything about what happens when Jeff doesn't play basketball. Amy might still have played tennis for other reasons, or she might not have played tennis. We simply don't have enough information to determine Amy's tennis-playing status.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"Amy did not play tennis\" from the given information. We can't make any conclusion about Amy playing tennis one way or the other.\n\nAnswer: no"
