            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"The car was not red\"\n   b) \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". In this case:\n   A = \"The car was red\"\n   B = \"The truck was blue\"\n\n3. We know from the first statement that A is false (the car was not red).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when it's false.\n\n5. The conditional statement doesn't provide any information about the color of the truck when the car is not red.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine whether the truck is blue or not blue.\n\n7. To infer \"The truck was not blue\", we would need additional information or a different logical structure.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot logically infer that \"The truck was not blue\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
