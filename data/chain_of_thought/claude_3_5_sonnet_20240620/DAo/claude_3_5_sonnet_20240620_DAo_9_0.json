            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) Lisa did not buy the red shirt\n   b) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   Q = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. We know from the first statement that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This means the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement is false.\n\n4. In logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the statement is always considered true, regardless of whether the consequent is true or false. This is known as \"vacuous truth.\"\n\n5. However, the fact that the conditional statement is true doesn't tell us anything about whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not. The statement only tells us what would happen if Lisa bought the red shirt, which we know she didn't.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about Mark buying or not buying the blue shirt based on the given information. Mark may or may not have bought the blue shirt; we simply don't have enough information to determine this.\n\n7. To infer that \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt,\" we would need additional information or a different logical structure in the given statements.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot logically infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
