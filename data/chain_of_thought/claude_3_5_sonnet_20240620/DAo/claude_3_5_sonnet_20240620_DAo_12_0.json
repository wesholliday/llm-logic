            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) Joe did not go to the park.\n   b) If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = Joe went to the park\n   Q = Lucy went to the zoo\n\n3. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when P is true, not when it's false.\n\n4. In this case, we know that Joe did not go to the park (P is false). The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if Joe did go to the park, but it doesn't give us any information about what happens when Joe doesn't go to the park.\n\n5. Therefore, we have no information about whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. She might have gone to the zoo for reasons unrelated to Joe going to the park, or she might not have gone at all.\n\n6. Since we can't determine whether Lucy went to the zoo or not based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
