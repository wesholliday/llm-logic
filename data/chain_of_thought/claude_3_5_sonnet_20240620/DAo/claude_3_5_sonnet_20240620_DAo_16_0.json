            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) The shirt was not cotton\n   b) If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the shirt was cotton\"\n   B = \"the pants were denim\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens when A is false. It only tells us what happens when A is true.\n\n4. From the first statement, we know that A is false (the shirt was not cotton).\n\n5. When the antecedent (A) of a conditional statement is false, we cannot draw any conclusion about the consequent (B). This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\n6. Therefore, knowing that the shirt was not cotton doesn't allow us to make any inference about whether the pants were denim or not.\n\n7. We don't have enough information to determine the status of the pants. They could be denim or they could not be denim - we simply can't tell from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
