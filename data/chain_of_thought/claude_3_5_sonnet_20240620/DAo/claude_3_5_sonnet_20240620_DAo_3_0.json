            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) The book was not written by James.\n   b) If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"The book was written by James\"\n   B = \"The book is a mystery novel\"\n\n3. The first statement tells us that A is false (the book was NOT written by James).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. The conditional statement doesn't provide any information about whether the book is a mystery novel when it's not written by James. It's possible that the book could still be a mystery novel even if James didn't write it.\n\n6. Therefore, we don't have enough information to determine whether the book is or is not a mystery novel.\n\n7. We cannot infer \"The book is not a mystery novel\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
