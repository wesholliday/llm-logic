            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) The vampire was not awake\n   b) If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   Q = \"the mummy was awake\"\n\n3. We know from statement (a) that the vampire was not awake. This means the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement is false.\n\n4. In logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the statement is always true regardless of whether the consequent is true or false. This is known as \"vacuous truth\".\n\n5. Therefore, the truth of the conditional statement doesn't give us any information about whether the mummy was awake or not when the vampire was not awake.\n\n6. We cannot conclude anything about the mummy's state (awake or not awake) based solely on these two given statements.\n\n7. To infer that \"The mummy was not awake\", we would need additional information or the contrapositive of the given conditional statement (If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake).\n\nGiven only the information provided, we cannot logically infer whether the mummy was awake or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
