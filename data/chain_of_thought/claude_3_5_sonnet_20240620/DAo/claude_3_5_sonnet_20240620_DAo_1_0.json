            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) Mary was not at the wedding\n   b) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = Mary was at the wedding\n   Q = Sue was at the wedding\n\n3. We know that Mary was not at the wedding. This means the antecedent (P) of the conditional statement is false.\n\n4. In logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the statement is always true regardless of whether the consequent is true or false. This is known as \"vacuous truth\".\n\n5. However, the conditional statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding. It only tells us what would happen if Mary was there.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot conclude anything about Sue's presence or absence at the wedding based on the given information.\n\n7. Sue could have been at the wedding or not - we simply don't have enough information to determine this.\n\n8. To infer that \"Sue was not at the wedding\" would be an incorrect logical leap, as we have no direct information about Sue's attendance.\n\nAnswer: no"
