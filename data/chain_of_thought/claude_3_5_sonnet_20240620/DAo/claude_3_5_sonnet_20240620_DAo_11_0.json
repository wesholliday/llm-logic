            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) The cake was not chocolate\n   b) If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"The cake was chocolate\"\n   Q = \"The muffins were blueberry\"\n\n3. The first statement tells us that P is false (the cake was not chocolate).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when P is true, not when it's false.\n\n5. The conditional statement doesn't provide any information about the muffins when the cake is not chocolate.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine whether the muffins were blueberry or not.\n\n7. We don't have enough information to conclude that \"The muffins were not blueberry.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
