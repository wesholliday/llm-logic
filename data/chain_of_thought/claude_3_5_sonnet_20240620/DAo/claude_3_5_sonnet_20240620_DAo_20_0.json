            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"The apple was not red\"\n   b) \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". This doesn't tell us anything about what happens when A is false.\n\n3. In our case, we know that \"The apple was not red\" (A is false). The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if the apple was red, but it doesn't give us any information about the banana's color when the apple is not red.\n\n4. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent\". Just because the \"if\" part of a conditional statement is false, we can't conclude anything about the \"then\" part.\n\n5. For example, even if the apple is not red, the banana could still be yellow for other reasons. Or it could be not yellow. We simply don't have enough information to determine the banana's color.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The banana was not yellow\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
