The original statement is in the form \"If A, then B\" where:\n   A = \"the glip was slogged\"\n   B = \"the glip was tragged\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is in the form \"If B, then A\", which is the converse of the original statement.\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. They are not logically equivalent.\n\n4. For example, consider this statement: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" This is true, but its converse \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining\" is not always true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n5. In our case, we know that if the glip was slogged, it was also tragged. But we don't have any information about whether being tragged always means it was slogged.\n\n6. There could be other ways for a glip to be tragged without being slogged, just as there could be other ways for the ground to be wet without rain.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
