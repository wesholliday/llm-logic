The original statement is in the form \"If A, then B\" where:\n   A = \"the fribble was snurgled\"\n   B = \"the fribble crinked\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is in the form \"If B, then A\", which is the converse of the original statement.\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. They are not logically equivalent.\n\n4. For example, consider this statement: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" This is true, but its converse \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining\" is not always true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n5. In our case, we know that if the fribble was snurgled, it crinked. But we don't know if this is the only condition that causes a fribble to crink. There could be other reasons for a fribble to crink that don't involve snurgling.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if a fribble crinked, it must have been snurgled.\n\nAnswer: no"
