The original statement is: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer the reverse: \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was blimmed.\"\n   This would be the converse of the original statement, in the form \"If B, then A.\"\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider an example to illustrate this:\n   Original: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n   Converse: \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining.\"\n   The original is true, but the converse isn't always true (the ground could be wet for other reasons).\n\n5. Similarly, in our case, while we know that blimming leads to zargling, we don't know if zargling only occurs as a result of blimming. There could be other ways for a flugel to be zargled without being blimmed.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement from the given information alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
