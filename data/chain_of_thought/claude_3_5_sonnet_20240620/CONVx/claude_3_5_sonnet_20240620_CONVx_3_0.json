The original statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed.\"\n   This would be the converse of the original statement, in the form \"If B, then A.\"\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. They are not logically equivalent.\n\n4. For example, consider this statement: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n   The converse would be: \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining.\"\n   We can see that the converse isn't always true, as the ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n5. Similarly, in our case, while it's true that a morphed splat always quanks, we don't know if quanking only happens when a splat is morphed. There could be other conditions that make a splat quank.\n\n6. Without additional information, we cannot logically infer the converse from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
