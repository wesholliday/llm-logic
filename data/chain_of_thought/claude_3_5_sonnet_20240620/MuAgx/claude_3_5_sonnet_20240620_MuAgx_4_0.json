            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement has two parts connected by \"and\":\n   a) \"The quorple must be at snork gribble\"\n   b) \"it must be in the wibble plonk\"\n\n2. The word \"it\" in the second part refers back to \"the quorple\" from the first part.\n\n3. Both parts use the phrase \"must be,\" indicating a requirement or necessity for both conditions.\n\n4. The inferred statement combines these two requirements into a single sentence:\n   \"The quorple must be at snork gribble and in the wibble plonk\"\n\n5. This inferred statement maintains the same meaning as the original:\n   - The quorple is required to be at snork gribble\n   - The quorple is required to be in the wibble plonk\n\n6. The only difference is the removal of the redundant \"it must be\" from the second part, which doesn't change the meaning.\n\n7. The logical relationship between the two parts (connected by \"and\") remains the same in both versions.\n\nGiven this analysis, the inferred statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. The meaning and requirements are preserved, just expressed more concisely.\n\nAnswer: yes"
