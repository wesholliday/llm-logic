            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The quazzle must be zibble and it must frazzle froodle zooble\"\n\n2. This statement has two parts connected by \"and\":\n   a) The quazzle must be zibble\n   b) It must frazzle froodle zooble\n\n3. The word \"it\" in the second part refers back to \"the quazzle\" from the first part.\n\n4. So, we can rewrite the statement as: \"The quazzle must be zibble and the quazzle must frazzle froodle zooble\"\n\n5. The proposed inference is: \"The quazzle must be zibble and frazzle froodle zooble\"\n\n6. Comparing the original statement and the inference:\n   - Both start with \"The quazzle must be zibble\"\n   - The original then says \"and it must frazzle froodle zooble\"\n   - The inference says \"and frazzle froodle zooble\"\n\n7. The only difference is the removal of \"it must\" in the inference.\n\n8. However, this removal doesn't change the meaning. \"The quazzle must\" from the first part is implicitly carried over to the second part in the inference.\n\n9. Therefore, the meaning of the original statement and the inference are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
