            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The plonk must be wibble and it must be wibble.\"\n\n2. This statement consists of two parts connected by \"and\":\n   a) The plonk must be wibble\n   b) It must be wibble\n\n3. Both parts are saying essentially the same thing - that the plonk must be wibble.\n\n4. The proposed inference is \"The plonk must be wibble and wibble.\"\n\n5. This inference also consists of two parts:\n   a) The plonk must be wibble\n   b) (The plonk must be) wibble\n\n6. The first part of the inference is identical to the first part of the original statement.\n\n7. The second part of the inference, while shorter, still conveys the same meaning as the second part of the original statement - that the plonk must be wibble.\n\n8. The repetition of \"wibble\" in the inference doesn't change the meaning; it's just a more concise way of expressing the same idea.\n\n9. Therefore, the inference is logically equivalent to the original statement, just expressed more concisely.\n\nAnswer: yes"
