            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden.\n   b) Fido is not in the garden.\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of these conditions must be true: Fido is inside, or Fido is in the garden.\n\n3. The second statement explicitly tells us that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n4. Given that there are only two possibilities (inside or in the garden), and we know for certain that one of these (in the garden) is false, we can conclude that the other possibility must be true.\n\n5. This is an application of the logical rule called \"disjunctive syllogism.\" If we have \"A or B\" and we know \"not B,\" then we can conclude A.\n\n6. Therefore, since Fido is not in the garden, and he must be either inside or in the garden, we can logically infer that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
