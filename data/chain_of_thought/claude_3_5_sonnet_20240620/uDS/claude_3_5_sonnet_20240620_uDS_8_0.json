            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) Either the remote control is on the coffee table OR it is hiding under the couch.\n   b) The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). This means that at least one of the two options must be true, but both could also be true.\n\n3. However, the second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. We're told that the remote control is not under the couch.\n\n4. In logic, this is known as disjunctive syllogism. When we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n5. Since we know the remote is not under the couch, and it must be either on the coffee table or under the couch, we can logically conclude that it must be on the coffee table.\n\n6. There are no other possibilities given in the premises, so we don't need to consider any other locations for the remote control.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can indeed infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
