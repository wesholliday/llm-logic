We're given two statements:\n   a) Either the watch is charging on the dresser OR it is on his wrist.\n   b) The watch isn't on his wrist.\n\n2. The first statement is an \"exclusive or\" (XOR) situation, meaning only one of these can be true at a time.\n\n3. We know from the second statement that the watch is not on his wrist.\n\n4. Given that one of the two options must be true (from statement 1), and we've ruled out one of those options (from statement 2), we can conclude that the remaining option must be true.\n\n5. The remaining option is that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can logically infer that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: yes"
