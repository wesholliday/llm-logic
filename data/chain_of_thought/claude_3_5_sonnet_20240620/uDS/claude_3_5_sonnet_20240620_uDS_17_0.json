            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n   b) The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n\n2. The first statement is an \"either-or\" statement, which means one of these two options must be true, but not both.\n\n3. The second statement eliminates one of these options: we know for certain that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\n\n4. Given that one of the two options must be true (from statement 1), and we've eliminated one of those options (from statement 2), we can conclude that the remaining option must be true.\n\n5. The remaining option is that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\n6. This is a classic example of logical deduction using the process of elimination.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the scarf is stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
