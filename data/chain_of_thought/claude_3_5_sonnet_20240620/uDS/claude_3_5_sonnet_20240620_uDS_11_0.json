            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) Either the newspaper is in the driveway OR it is sitting on the porch.\n   b) The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch.\n\n2. The first statement is an \"exclusive or\" statement, meaning one of these two options must be true, but not both.\n\n3. The second statement eliminates one of these options - we know for certain that the newspaper is not on the porch.\n\n4. Given that there are only two possible locations for the newspaper (driveway or porch), and we know it's not on the porch, we can logically conclude that it must be in the driveway.\n\n5. This is an example of a logical deduction known as \"disjunctive syllogism.\" When we have an \"either/or\" statement and can eliminate one of the options, the remaining option must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, we can indeed infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: yes"
