            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) The book is either on the shelf or on the table.\n   b) The book is not on the table.\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true, and possibly both could be true.\n\n3. However, the second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. We know for certain that the book is not on the table.\n\n4. Given that there are only two possible locations for the book (shelf or table), and we know it's not on the table, we can conclude through the process of elimination that it must be on the shelf.\n\n5. This type of logical reasoning is known as disjunctive syllogism. When we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the information provided, we can indeed infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
