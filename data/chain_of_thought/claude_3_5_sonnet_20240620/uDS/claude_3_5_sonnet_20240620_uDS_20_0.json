We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) Either the sunglasses are in her bag OR they are perched on her head.\n   b) The sunglasses are NOT perched on her head.\n\n2. The first statement is an \"exclusive or\" (XOR) logical operation. This means that one and only one of these options must be true.\n\n3. We know from the second statement that the sunglasses are not perched on her head. This eliminates one of the two possibilities from the first statement.\n\n4. Since we know that one of the two options must be true (from the XOR in the first statement), and we've eliminated one of those options, we can conclude that the remaining option must be true.\n\n5. The remaining option is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
