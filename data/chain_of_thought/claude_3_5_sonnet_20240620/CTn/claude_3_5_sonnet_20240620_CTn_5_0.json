            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n   P = \"Jeff played basketball\"\n   Q = \"Amy did not play tennis\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n   This is another conditional statement, but with different components:\n   R = \"Amy played tennis\"\n   S = \"Jeff did not play basketball\"\n\n3. To determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between these statements.\n\n4. The original statement tells us that Jeff playing basketball implies Amy not playing tennis. In other words, these two events cannot occur together.\n\n5. Logically, this means that if Amy did play tennis, Jeff could not have played basketball. Because if Jeff had played basketball, Amy would not have played tennis (according to the original statement).\n\n6. This relationship is known as the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and it is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n7. In this case:\n   Original: If Jeff played basketball (P), then Amy did not play tennis (not R)\n   Contrapositive: If Amy played tennis (R), then Jeff did not play basketball (not P)\n\n8. The contrapositive is exactly the statement we're asked about in the question.\n\n9. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the given statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
