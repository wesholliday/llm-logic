            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"Tom watched football\"\n   B = \"Jen did not watch basketball\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\n4. This new statement is also a conditional, but with different components:\n   C = \"Jen watched basketball\"\n   D = \"Tom did not watch football\"\n\n5. To determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between the original statement and the proposed inference.\n\n6. The proposed inference is actually the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive is always equivalent to the original statement.\n\n7. To form the contrapositive:\n   - We negate both parts of the original statement\n   - We reverse the order\n\n8. Negating the parts:\n   - \"Tom watched football\" becomes \"Tom did not watch football\"\n   - \"Jen did not watch basketball\" becomes \"Jen watched basketball\"\n\n9. Reversing the order gives us:\n   \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football\"\n\n10. This is exactly the statement we're asked about in the question.\n\nTherefore, since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the given statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
