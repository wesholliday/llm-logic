            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n   P = \"Ben ate pasta\"\n   Q = \"Kate did not eat the salad\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n   This is also a conditional statement, but in the form \"If not Q, then not P,\" where:\n   not Q = \"Kate ate the salad\"\n   not P = \"Ben did not eat pasta\"\n\n3. In logic, the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" is known as the contrapositive of the original statement \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n4. A fundamental rule in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. They always have the same truth value.\n\n5. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\n6. Therefore, from the given statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate did not eat the salad,\" we can indeed logically infer \"If Kate ate the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
