            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the given statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   B = \"the mummy was not awake\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer the inverse of this statement, which would be \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\n4. In logic, we cannot automatically infer the inverse of a conditional statement. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. To illustrate this, let's consider a truth table:\n\n   Vampire Awake | Mummy Awake | Original Statement | Inverse\n   --------------|--------------|--------------------|--------\n        T        |      F       |         T          |   T\n        T        |      T       |         F          |   F\n        F        |      F       |         T          |   T\n        F        |      T       |         T          |   T\n\n6. As we can see, there are situations where the original statement is true, but the inverse is not necessarily true (e.g., when both are not awake).\n\n7. The only valid inference we can make from \"If A, then B\" is its contrapositive: \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, that would be \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\n8. Interestingly, the contrapositive happens to be identical to the inverse in this specific case, but this is not generally true for all conditional statements.\n\n9. However, we cannot make this inference based solely on the logic of the given statement. It's true here because of the specific nature of the situation (two beings can't both be awake), not because of the logical structure of the statement.\n\nTherefore, while the conclusion happens to be true in this specific scenario, we cannot logically infer it from the given statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
