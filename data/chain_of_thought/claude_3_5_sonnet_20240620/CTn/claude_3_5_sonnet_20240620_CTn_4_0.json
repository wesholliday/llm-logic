            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   A: \"The alien visited Mars\"\n   R: \"The robot visited Jupiter\"\n\n2. The given statement is: If A, then not R\n   This can be written in logical form as: A \u2192 \u00acR\n\n3. We need to determine if this is equivalent to: If R, then not A\n   Which in logical form would be: R \u2192 \u00acA\n\n4. To check if these are equivalent, we can use the contrapositive rule. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the conditional and reversing their order.\n\n6. So, the contrapositive of \"If A, then not R\" is:\n   \"If R, then not A\"\n\n7. This is exactly the statement we're trying to infer.\n\n8. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
