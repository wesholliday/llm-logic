            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n   P = \"Joe went to the park\"\n   Q = \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\"\n\n3. In logic, we can derive the contrapositive of a conditional statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order. It takes the form \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n5. In this case, the contrapositive would be:\n   \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n\n6. This is because:\n   - The negation of \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n   - The negation of \"Joe went to the park\" is \"Joe did not go to the park\"\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer it from the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" from the original statement \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
