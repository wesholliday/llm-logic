            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was not outside.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the dog was inside\"\n   B = \"the cat was not outside\"\n\n3. To determine if we can infer the proposed statement, we need to see if it's the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n5. In our case, the contrapositive would be:\n   \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n\n6. This is because:\n   - \"The cat was outside\" is the negation of \"The cat was not outside\"\n   - \"The dog was not inside\" is the negation of \"The dog was inside\"\n\n7. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\n8. The proposed statement in the question is exactly the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If the cat was outside, then the dog was not inside\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
