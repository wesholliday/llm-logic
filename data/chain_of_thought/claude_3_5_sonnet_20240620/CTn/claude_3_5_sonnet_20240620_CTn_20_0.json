            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the apple was red\"\n   B = \"the banana was not yellow\"\n\n3. Now, let's look at the proposed inference: \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n\n4. This is also a conditional statement, but it's different:\n   C = \"the banana was yellow\"\n   D = \"the apple was not red\"\n\n5. Notice that C is the negation of B, and D is the negation of A.\n\n6. In logic, this transformation is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n7. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n8. In our case:\n   Original: If (apple red), then (banana not yellow)\n   Contrapositive: If (banana yellow), then (apple not red)\n\n9. As we can see, the proposed inference is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
