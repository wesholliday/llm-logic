            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n   P = \"the doll was plastic\"\n   Q = \"the truck was not metal\"\n\n3. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n\n4. This new statement is in the form \"If not Q, then not P,\" which is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n5. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n6. To verify this, we can consider the truth table:\n   - If the doll is plastic, the truck cannot be metal (as per the original statement).\n   - If the truck is metal, the doll cannot be plastic (as this would contradict the original statement).\n\n7. Therefore, the contrapositive \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was not plastic\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
