            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the given statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer the statement: \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n   This would be the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n4. Let's break down the original statement:\n   A: Sue chose pizza\n   B: Bob did not choose pasta\n\n5. The original statement is: If A, then B\n\n6. The contrapositive would be: If not B, then not A\n\n7. Translating this back into our context:\n   \"If Bob chose pasta (which is the negation of 'Bob did not choose pasta'), then Sue did not choose pizza (which is the negation of 'Sue chose pizza').\"\n\n8. This is exactly the statement we're asked about in the question.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If Bob chose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
