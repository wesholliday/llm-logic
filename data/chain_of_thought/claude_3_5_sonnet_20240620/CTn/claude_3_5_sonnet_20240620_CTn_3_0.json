            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the given statement:\n   \"If the book was written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P: The book was written by James\n   Q: The book is not a mystery novel\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n5. In our case, this would be:\n   \"If the book is a mystery novel (not Q), then the book was not written by James (not P)\"\n\n6. In logic, a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. They always have the same truth value.\n\n7. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n8. Therefore, we can indeed infer the statement \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
