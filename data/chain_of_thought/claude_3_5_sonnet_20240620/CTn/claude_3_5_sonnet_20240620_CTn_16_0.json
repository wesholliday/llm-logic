            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the shirt was cotton\"\n   B = \"the pants were not denim\"\n\n3. To determine if we can infer the proposed statement, we need to see if it's the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n5. In our case, the contrapositive would be:\n   \"If the pants were denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\"\n\n6. This is exactly the statement we're asked about.\n\n7. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. They always have the same truth value.\n\n8. Therefore, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer the proposed statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
