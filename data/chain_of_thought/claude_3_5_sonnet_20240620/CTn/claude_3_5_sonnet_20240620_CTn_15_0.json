            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n   P = \"Sam took a plane\"\n   Q = \"Erin did not take a train\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n   This is another conditional statement, but it's different:\n   R = \"Erin took a train\"\n   S = \"Sam did not take a plane\"\n\n3. To determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider the logical relationship between these statements.\n\n4. The original statement tells us that if Sam took a plane, it's impossible for Erin to have taken a train. In other words, Sam taking a plane and Erin taking a train cannot both be true.\n\n5. Now, let's consider the proposed inference. It states that if Erin took a train, then Sam could not have taken a plane. \n\n6. This is logically equivalent to the original statement. If Erin taking a train means Sam didn't take a plane, then Sam taking a plane would mean Erin didn't take a train.\n\n7. In formal logic, this relationship is known as contraposition. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P,\" and they are logically equivalent.\n\n8. In this case, \"Erin took a train\" is the negation of \"Erin did not take a train,\" and \"Sam did not take a plane\" is the negation of \"Sam took a plane.\"\n\n9. Therefore, the proposed inference is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement, and it is a valid logical inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
