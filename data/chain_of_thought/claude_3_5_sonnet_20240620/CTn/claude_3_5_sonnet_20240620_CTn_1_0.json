            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then not B.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n   This would be a conditional statement in the form \"If B, then not A.\"\n\n3. In logic, these two forms are not logically equivalent. The second statement is actually the contrapositive of the inverse of the first statement.\n\n4. To illustrate, let's consider all possibilities:\n   - Mary at wedding, Sue not at wedding (satisfies original statement)\n   - Mary not at wedding, Sue at wedding (satisfies both statements)\n   - Mary not at wedding, Sue not at wedding (doesn't violate either statement)\n   - Mary at wedding, Sue at wedding (violates original statement)\n\n5. As we can see, there's a scenario (Mary not at wedding, Sue not at wedding) that satisfies the original statement but not necessarily the inferred statement.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first. The original statement doesn't give us enough information to conclude that Sue's presence necessarily means Mary's absence.\n\nAnswer: no"
