            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's understand the given statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then not B.\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate.\"\n   This is another conditional statement in the form \"If B, then not A.\"\n\n3. In logic, this transformation is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n4. In our case:\n   Original: If A (cake was chocolate), then not B (muffins were not blueberry)\n   Contrapositive: If B (muffins were blueberry), then not A (cake was not chocolate)\n\n5. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n6. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
