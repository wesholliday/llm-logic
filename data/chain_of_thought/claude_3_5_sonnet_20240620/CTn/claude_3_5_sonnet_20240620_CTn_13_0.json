            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the car was red\"\n   B = \"the truck was not blue\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\n4. This new statement is also a conditional, but with different components:\n   C = \"the truck was blue\"\n   D = \"the car was not red\"\n\n5. Notice that C is the negation of B, and D is the negation of A.\n\n6. In logic, when we flip the order of a conditional statement and negate both parts, it's called the contrapositive. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n7. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n8. In our case, \"If the truck was blue\" is indeed the negation of \"the truck was not blue,\" and \"the car was not red\" is the negation of \"the car was red.\"\n\n9. Therefore, the statement \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" is the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n10. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer this new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
