            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define the given statement:\n   \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\n   B = \"Mark did not buy the blue shirt\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n5. In our case, the contrapositive would be:\n   \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\"\n\n6. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. They always have the same truth value.\n\n7. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n8. Therefore, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
