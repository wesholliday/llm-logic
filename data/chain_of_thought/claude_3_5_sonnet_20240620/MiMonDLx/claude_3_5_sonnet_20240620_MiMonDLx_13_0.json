            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The zooble might be quork.\"\n2. This statement expresses a possibility, not a certainty.\n3. The word \"might\" indicates that there's a chance the zooble is quork, but it's not definite.\n4. The proposed inference is \"The zooble might be quork or grazzle.\"\n5. This new statement still maintains the possibility that the zooble might be quork.\n6. It also adds another possibility: that the zooble might be grazzle.\n7. In logic, when we have a statement \"A or B,\" it's true if either A is true, B is true, or both are true.\n8. Adding an additional possibility (grazzle) doesn't contradict or negate the original possibility (quork).\n9. Therefore, the original statement is fully contained within the new statement, just with an additional possibility added.\n10. In formal logic, this is known as disjunction introduction or \"or-introduction.\"\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that the inference is valid. The new statement is a logical extension of the original one, preserving the original possibility while adding another.\n\nAnswer: yes"
