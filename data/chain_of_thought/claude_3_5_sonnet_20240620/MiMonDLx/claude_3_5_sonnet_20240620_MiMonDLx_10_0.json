This statement expresses a possibility about the snork's state.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The snork might be plonk or wobble.\"\n4. In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B, because if A is true, then \"A or B\" is always true regardless of whether B is true or false.\n5. This is known as the rule of disjunction introduction or addition in formal logic.\n6. In this case, \"plonk\" corresponds to A, and \"wobble\" corresponds to B.\n7. Therefore, if it's possible that the snork is plonk, it's also logically true that the snork might be plonk or wobble.\n8. The \"might be\" in both statements preserves the element of possibility, so the logic holds.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
