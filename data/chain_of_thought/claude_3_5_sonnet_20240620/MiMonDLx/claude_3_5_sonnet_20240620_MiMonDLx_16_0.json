            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The zibber might be froodle.\"\n2. We're asked if we can infer \"The zibber might be froodle or on wibble\" from this.\n3. In logic, if a statement A is true, then \"A or B\" is always true, regardless of whether B is true or false. This is known as the law of disjunction introduction.\n4. In this case, \"The zibber might be froodle\" is our statement A.\n5. \"The zibber might be on wibble\" would be our statement B.\n6. Even if we don't know anything about whether the zibber might be on wibble, we can still say that \"The zibber might be froodle or on wibble\" is true, because we know the first part is possible.\n7. The word \"might\" in both statements preserves the uncertainty present in the original statement.\n8. Therefore, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
