            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The zibble might be wozzle.\"\n2. We're asked if we can infer \"The zibble might be wozzle or snork\" from this.\n3. The key logical principle here is disjunction introduction. This principle states that if A is true, then \"A or B\" is also true, regardless of whether B is true or false.\n4. In this case, \"The zibble might be wozzle\" is our A, and \"The zibble might be snork\" would be our B.\n5. Even if we don't know anything about \"snork,\" the disjunction \"wozzle or snork\" is still logically valid.\n6. The word \"might\" in both statements preserves the uncertainty, so we're not introducing any additional claims of certainty.\n7. Therefore, if it's possible that \"The zibble might be wozzle,\" it's also possible that \"The zibble might be wozzle or snork,\" because the second statement includes all possibilities of the first statement, plus an additional possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes"
