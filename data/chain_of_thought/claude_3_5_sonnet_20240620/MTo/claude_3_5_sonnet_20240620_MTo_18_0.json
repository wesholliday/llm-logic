            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The truck was not metal\"\n   b) \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"The doll was plastic\"\n   Q = \"The truck was metal\"\n\n3. We know from statement (a) that the truck was not metal. This means Q is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   - We have \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n   - We know the truck was not metal (Q is false)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic (P is false)\n\n6. This conclusion \"The doll was not plastic\" is exactly what we're being asked to infer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The doll was not plastic\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
