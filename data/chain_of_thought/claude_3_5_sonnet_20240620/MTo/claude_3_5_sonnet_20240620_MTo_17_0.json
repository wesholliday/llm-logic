            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) Kate did not eat the salad\n   b) If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"Ben ate pasta\"\n   Q = \"Kate ate the salad\"\n\n3. We know from the first statement that Kate did not eat the salad. This means Q is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. To understand why, consider the possibilities:\n   - If P were true (Ben ate pasta), then Q would have to be true (Kate ate the salad) according to the conditional statement.\n   - But we know Q is false (Kate did not eat the salad).\n   - Therefore, P cannot be true.\n\n6. Thus, we can conclude that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: yes"
