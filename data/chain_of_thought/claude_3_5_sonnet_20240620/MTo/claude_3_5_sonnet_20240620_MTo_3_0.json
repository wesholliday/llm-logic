            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) The book is not a mystery novel.\n   b) If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n\n2. Let's consider statement (b). This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The book was written by James\n   B: The book is a mystery novel\n\n3. We know from statement (a) that B is false (the book is NOT a mystery novel).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - If A is true (the book was written by James), then B must be true (the book is a mystery novel).\n   - But we know B is false (the book is not a mystery novel).\n   - Therefore, A must be false (the book was not written by James).\n\n6. This logical conclusion matches the statement we're asked to infer: \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
