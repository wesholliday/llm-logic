            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) Jen did not watch basketball\n   b) If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = Tom watched football\n   Q = Jen watched basketball\n\n3. We know from the first given statement that Jen did not watch basketball. This means Q is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - We know that Q (Jen watched basketball) is false\n   - We have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\"\n   - Therefore, P (Tom watched football) must also be false\n\n6. If P is false, it means that \"Tom did not watch football\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
