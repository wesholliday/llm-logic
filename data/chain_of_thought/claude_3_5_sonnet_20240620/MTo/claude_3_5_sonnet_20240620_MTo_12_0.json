            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) Lucy did not go to the zoo\n   b) If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"Joe went to the park\"\n   Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\n3. We know from the first statement that Lucy did not go to the zoo. This means Q is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our situation:\n   - We have: If P, then Q\n   - We know: not Q (Lucy did not go to the zoo)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude: not P (Joe did not go to the park)\n\n6. This logical deduction tells us that if Lucy did not go to the zoo, and we know that Joe going to the park would have resulted in Lucy going to the zoo, then Joe must not have gone to the park.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that Joe did not go to the park from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
