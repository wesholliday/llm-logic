            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) Erin did not take a train\n   b) If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"Sam took a plane\"\n   Q = \"Erin took a train\"\n\n3. We know from the first statement that Erin did not take a train. This means Q is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. If P (Sam took a plane) were true, then Q (Erin took a train) would have to be true according to the conditional statement. But we know Q is false.\n\n6. Therefore, P must be false. In other words, Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
