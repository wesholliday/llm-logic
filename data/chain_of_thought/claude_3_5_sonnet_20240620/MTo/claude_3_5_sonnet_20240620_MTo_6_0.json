            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) Bob did not choose pasta\n   b) If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\"\n   Where A = \"Sue chose pizza\" and B = \"Bob chose pasta\"\n\n3. We know from the first given statement that Bob did not choose pasta\n   This means that B is false\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false\n   This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens (denying the consequent)\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   If \"Bob chose pasta\" is false, then \"Sue chose pizza\" must also be false\n\n6. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Sue did not choose pizza\n\nAnswer: yes"
