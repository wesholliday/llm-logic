            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The muffins were not blueberry\"\n   b) \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\"\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"The cake was chocolate\"\n   B = \"The muffins were blueberry\"\n\n3. Now, we know from the first statement that \"The muffins were not blueberry\"\n   This directly contradicts B in our conditional statement.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\"\n   - We know \"not B\" is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"not A\" is true\n\n6. Translating this back to our original statements:\n   - If \"The cake was chocolate\" is true, then \"The muffins were blueberry\" would be true\n   - But we know \"The muffins were not blueberry\"\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"The cake was not chocolate\"\n\nSo, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
