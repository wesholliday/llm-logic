            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) The unicorn was not in the forest.\n   b) If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n3. We know from the first statement that the unicorn was not in the forest. This negates the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this principle to our situation:\n   - If A (griffin in the forest), then B (unicorn in the forest)\n   - We know not B (unicorn not in the forest)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude not A (griffin not in the forest)\n\n6. This logical deduction allows us to infer that if the unicorn was not in the forest, and the presence of the griffin would necessitate the presence of the unicorn, then the griffin must also not have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
