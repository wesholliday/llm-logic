            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) The banana was not yellow.\n   b) If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n3. We know from the first statement that the banana was not yellow. This contradicts the consequent (the \"then\" part) of the conditional statement.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   - If A (the apple was red), then B (the banana was yellow)\n   - We know that B is false (the banana was not yellow)\n   - Therefore, A must also be false (the apple was not red)\n\n6. This logical deduction allows us to conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
