            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) Amy did not play tennis\n   b) If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"Jeff played basketball\"\n   Q = \"Amy played tennis\"\n\n3. We know from the first given statement that Amy did not play tennis. This means Q is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our situation:\n   - We have: If P, then Q\n   - We know: not Q (Amy did not play tennis)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude: not P (Jeff did not play basketball)\n\n6. This conclusion \"Jeff did not play basketball\" is exactly what we're asked if we can infer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
