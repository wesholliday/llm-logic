            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) The pants were not denim\n   b) If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\" where:\n   A = \"the shirt was cotton\"\n   B = \"the pants were denim\"\n\n3. We know from the first statement that the pants were not denim. This means that B is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens or \"denying the consequent.\"\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - We know that B (pants were denim) is false\n   - Therefore, A (the shirt was cotton) must also be false\n\n6. The negation of \"the shirt was cotton\" is \"the shirt was not cotton\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The shirt was not cotton.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
