            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"The truck was not blue\"\n   b) \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"The car was red\"\n   Q = \"The truck was blue\"\n\n3. We know from statement (a) that the truck was not blue. This means Q is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   - We have \"If P, then Q\"\n   - We know Q is false\n   - Therefore, P must also be false\n\n6. P being false means \"The car was red\" is false.\n\n7. If \"The car was red\" is false, then it's logically equivalent to say \"The car was not red\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The car was not red\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
