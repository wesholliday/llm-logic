            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) Chris did not finish the race.\n   b) If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n3. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens.\n\n4. In our case:\n   A = \"Alex finished the race\"\n   B = \"Chris finished the race\"\n\n5. We know that B is false because we're explicitly told that Chris did not finish the race.\n\n6. Applying modus tollens, if B is false, then A must also be false.\n\n7. Therefore, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: yes"
