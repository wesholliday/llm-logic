            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) Mark did not buy the blue shirt\n   b) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   Q = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. We know from statement (a) that Q is false (Mark did not buy the blue shirt).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - We know \"If P, then Q\" (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt)\n   - We know \"not Q\" (Mark did not buy the blue shirt)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"not P\" (Lisa did not buy the red shirt)\n\n6. This conclusion \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is exactly what we're asked if we can infer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
