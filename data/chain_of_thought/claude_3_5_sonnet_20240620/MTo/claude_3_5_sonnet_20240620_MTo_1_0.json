            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) Sue was not at the wedding\n   b) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\"\n   Where A = \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n3. We know from the first statement that Sue was not at the wedding. This means B is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens.\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - We have \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n   - We know Sue was not at the wedding (B is false)\n   - Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding (A must be false)\n\n6. This conclusion \"Mary was not at the wedding\" is exactly what we're being asked to infer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
