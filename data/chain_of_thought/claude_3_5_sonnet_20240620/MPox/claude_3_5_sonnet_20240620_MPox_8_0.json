            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The sprocket was cranked\"\n   b) \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\"\n\n2. The first statement is a simple fact: the sprocket was indeed cranked.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement. It establishes a relationship between two events:\n   - If the sprocket is cranked (the condition)\n   - Then the sprocket is daggled (the consequence)\n\n4. In logical terms, this is known as modus ponens, a valid form of reasoning:\n   - If P, then Q\n   - P is true\n   - Therefore, Q must be true\n\n5. In our case:\n   - P = \"The sprocket was cranked\"\n   - Q = \"The sprocket was daggled\"\n\n6. We know that P is true (given in the first statement)\n   We also know that \"If P, then Q\" (given in the second statement)\n\n7. Therefore, following the logical rule of modus ponens, we can conclude that Q must also be true.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The sprocket was daggled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
