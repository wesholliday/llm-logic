            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The sneg was crampled\"\n   b) \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If A, then B\":\n   - A: \"The sneg was crampled\"\n   - B: \"The sneg sproted the frink\"\n\n3. The first given statement directly affirms that A is true: \"The sneg was crampled\"\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This is a basic rule of inference called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have the conditional: If A, then B\n   - We know A is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude B is true\n\n6. In this case, B is \"The sneg sproted the frink\"\n\n7. Thus, based on the given information and using logical inference, we can indeed conclude that \"The sneg sproted the frink\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
