            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The splat was morphed\"\n   b) \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\"\n\n2. The first statement is a simple declaration that an event occurred: the splat was indeed morphed.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement. It says that if one thing happens (the splat is morphed), then another thing must also happen (the splat quanks).\n\n4. In logic, this type of reasoning is called Modus Ponens. It follows the structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   P is true\n   Therefore, Q must be true\n\n5. In our case:\n   P = \"The splat was morphed\"\n   Q = \"The splat quanked\"\n\n6. We know that P is true from the first given statement.\n\n7. We also know that \"If P, then Q\" is true from the second given statement.\n\n8. Therefore, following the principle of Modus Ponens, we can conclude that Q must also be true.\n\n9. This means we can indeed infer that \"The splat quanked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
