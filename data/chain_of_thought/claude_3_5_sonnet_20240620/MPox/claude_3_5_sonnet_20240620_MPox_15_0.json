            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The dreb was vroombed\"\n   b) \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\"\n\n2. The first statement is a simple assertion: The dreb was indeed vroombed.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" is true, then the consequence \"the dreb was spened\" must also be true.\n\n4. We know from the first statement that the condition \"the dreb was vroombed\" is true.\n\n5. Since the condition in the second statement is met (the dreb was vroombed), we can conclude that the consequence must also be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can logically infer that \"The dreb was spened\".\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical inference called Modus Ponens, where given a conditional statement and the affirmation of its antecedent, we can conclude its consequent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
