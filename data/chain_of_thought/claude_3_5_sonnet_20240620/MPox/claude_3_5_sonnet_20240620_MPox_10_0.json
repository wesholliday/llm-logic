            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The wug was sproinged\"\n   b) \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\"\n\n2. The first statement is a simple declaration: The wug was indeed sproinged.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the condition \"the wug was sproinged\" is true, then the conclusion \"it was garpled\" must also be true.\n\n4. We know from the first statement that the condition \"the wug was sproinged\" is true.\n\n5. Since the condition in the conditional statement is met (the wug was sproinged), we can conclude that the result must also be true (it was garpled).\n\n6. This form of logical reasoning is called Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\n7. Therefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that \"It was garpled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
