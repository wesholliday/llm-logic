            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The grommet was sploffed\"\n   b) \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n2. The first statement is a simple assertion: The grommet was indeed sploffed.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement. It says that IF something is true (the grommet was sploffed), THEN something else must also be true (the grommet plopped the frink).\n\n4. In logic, this type of reasoning is called \"modus ponens.\" It follows the form:\n   If P, then Q\n   P is true\n   Therefore, Q is true\n\n5. In our case:\n   P = \"The grommet was sploffed\"\n   Q = \"The grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n6. We know that P is true from the first given statement.\n\n7. The second statement tells us that if P is true, then Q must be true.\n\n8. Since we've established that P is true, and we know that if P is true then Q is true, we can logically conclude that Q must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet plopped the frink\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
