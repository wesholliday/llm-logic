            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The twonk was plinked\"\n   b) \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\"\n\n2. The first statement is a simple fact: the twonk was indeed plinked.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement. It says that if the condition \"the twonk was plinked\" is true, then the consequence \"it was varnished\" must also be true.\n\n4. We know from the first statement that the condition in the second statement is met - the twonk was plinked.\n\n5. When the condition of a conditional statement is true, and the conditional statement itself is true, we can conclude that the consequence must also be true.\n\n6. Therefore, since we know the twonk was plinked, and we know that if it was plinked then it was varnished, we can logically conclude that it was varnished.\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical inference called Modus Ponens, where given \"If P, then Q\" and \"P\", we can conclude \"Q\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
