            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". In this case:\n   A = Mary was at the wedding\n   B = Sue was at the wedding\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B is true (Sue was indeed at the wedding).\n\n4. However, the conditional statement only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. It doesn't work in reverse.\n\n5. In logical terms, this is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because the consequent (B) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (A) is true.\n\n6. For example, there could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding that don't involve Mary being there. Sue might have been invited independently, or she might have been working at the wedding.\n\n7. The only thing we can conclude for certain from these statements is that Sue was at the wedding. We cannot logically infer anything about Mary's presence or absence.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
