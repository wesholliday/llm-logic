            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". It doesn't say anything about what happens if B is true; it only states what must be true if A is true.\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true.\n\n4. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that A (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true. The conditional statement only works in one direction: A implies B, but B doesn't necessarily imply A.\n\n5. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\". Just because the consequent (B) is true, we can't conclude that the antecedent (A) must be true.\n\n6. For example, there could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt that have nothing to do with Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\n7. To illustrate this further, consider a similar structure: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" If we know the ground is wet, we can't conclude it's raining - the ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
