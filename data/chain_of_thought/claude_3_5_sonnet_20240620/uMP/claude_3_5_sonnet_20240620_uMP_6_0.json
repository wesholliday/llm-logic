            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\n   b) Sue chose pizza.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = Sue chose pizza\n   B = Bob chose pasta\n\n3. The second statement confirms that A is true (Sue did choose pizza).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This logical rule is called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our scenario:\n   - We know that \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" (If A, then B)\n   - We also know that \"Sue chose pizza\" (A is true)\n   - Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"Bob chose pasta\" (B must be true)\n\n6. This inference is valid and follows directly from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
