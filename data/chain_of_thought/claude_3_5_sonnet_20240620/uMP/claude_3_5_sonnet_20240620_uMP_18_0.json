            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n   b) The doll was plastic.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the doll was plastic\"\n   B = \"the truck was metal\"\n\n3. The second statement directly affirms that A is true (the doll was plastic).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This logical rule is called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our scenario:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\"\n   - We know A is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude B is true\n\n6. Translating this back to our original statements:\n   - We have \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n   - We know \"The doll was plastic\" is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"The truck was metal\" is true\n\nBased on this logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the truck was metal.\n\nAnswer: yes"
