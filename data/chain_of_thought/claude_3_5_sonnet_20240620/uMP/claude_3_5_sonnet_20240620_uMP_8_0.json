We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n   b) The vampire was awake.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   B = \"the mummy was awake\"\n\n3. The second statement directly tells us that A is true (the vampire was awake).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This is a basic rule of inference called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\"\n   - We know A is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude B is true\n\n6. Translating this back to our original terms:\n   - We have \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\"\n   - We know the vampire was awake\n   - Therefore, we can conclude the mummy was awake\n\nBased on this logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
