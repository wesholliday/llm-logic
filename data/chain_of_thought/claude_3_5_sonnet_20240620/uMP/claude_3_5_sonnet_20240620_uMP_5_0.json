            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n   b) Jeff played basketball.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = Jeff played basketball\n   B = Amy played tennis\n\n3. The second statement confirms that A is true (Jeff did play basketball).\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Ponens, which states:\n   If we have \"If A, then B\" and we know A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   We have \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" (If A, then B)\n   We know Jeff played basketball (A is true)\n   Therefore, we can conclude that Amy played tennis (B is true)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw a definite conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
