            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n   b) The car was red.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the car was red\"\n   B = \"the truck was blue\"\n\n3. The second statement directly affirms that A is true (the car was red).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This logical rule is called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our scenario:\n   - We know that \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" (If A, then B)\n   - We also know that \"The car was red\" (A is true)\n   - Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"The truck was blue\" (B must be true)\n\n6. This inference is valid and follows directly from the given information using standard rules of logical deduction.\n\nAnswer: yes"
