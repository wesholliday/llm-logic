The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the apple was red\"\n   B = \"the banana was yellow\"\n\n3. The second statement confirms that A is true (the apple was red).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This logical rule is called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\"\n   - We know A is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude B is true\n\n6. Translating this back to our original statements:\n   - We have \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n   - We know \"The apple was red\" is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"The banana was yellow\" is true\n\nBased on this logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the banana was yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes"
