The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Sam took a plane\n   B: Erin took a train\n\n3. The second statement confirms that A is true: Sam did indeed take a plane.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This is a rule of inference called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We know that \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true.\n   - We also know that \"Sam took a plane\" is true.\n   - Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"Erin took a train\" must be true.\n\n6. This inference is valid and based on the given information, we can confidently conclude that Erin took a train.\n\nAnswer: yes"
