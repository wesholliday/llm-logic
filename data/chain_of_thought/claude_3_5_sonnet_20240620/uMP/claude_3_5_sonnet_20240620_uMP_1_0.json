            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Mary was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Mary was at the wedding\n   B: Sue was at the wedding\n\n3. The second statement confirms that A is true: Mary was indeed at the wedding.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This is a basic rule of inference called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We know that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" (If A, then B)\n   - We know that \"Mary was at the wedding\" (A is true)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that \"Sue was at the wedding\" (B must be true)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw a definite conclusion about Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
