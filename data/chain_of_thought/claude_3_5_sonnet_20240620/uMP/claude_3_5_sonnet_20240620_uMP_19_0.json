            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n   b) Tom watched football.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = Tom watched football\n   B = Jen watched basketball\n\n3. The second statement directly confirms that A is true (Tom watched football).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This logical rule is called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\"\n   - We know A is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude B is true\n\n6. Translating this back to our original statements:\n   - We have \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\"\n   - We know Tom watched football\n   - Therefore, we can conclude Jen watched basketball\n\nBased on this logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that Jen watched basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
