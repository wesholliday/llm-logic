We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n   b) The dog was inside.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The dog was inside\n   B: The cat was outside\n\n3. The second statement directly confirms that A is true: The dog was indeed inside.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This is a rule of inference called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\"\n   - We know \"The dog was inside\" is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"The cat was outside\" must be true\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw a definite conclusion about the cat's location based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
