            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B: Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement confirms that A is true: Lisa did indeed buy the red shirt.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This logical rule is called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our scenario:\n   - We know that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true.\n   - We also know that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n   - Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" must be true.\n\n6. This inference is valid and follows directly from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
