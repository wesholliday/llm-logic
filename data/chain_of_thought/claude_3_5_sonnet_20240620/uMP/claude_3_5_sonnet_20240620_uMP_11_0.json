            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n   b) The cake was chocolate.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The cake was chocolate\n   B: The muffins were blueberry\n\n3. The second statement directly affirms that A is true: The cake was chocolate.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This logical rule is called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\"\n   - We know A is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude B is true\n\n6. Translating this back to our specific scenario:\n   - We have \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\"\n   - We know the cake was chocolate\n   - Therefore, we can conclude the muffins were blueberry\n\nBased on this logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nAnswer: yes"
