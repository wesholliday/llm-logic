            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   b) The book was written by James.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the book was written by James\"\n   B = \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n3. The second statement directly affirms that A is true: the book was indeed written by James.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as \"modus ponens\" or \"affirming the antecedent.\" It follows this structure:\n   If A, then B\n   A is true\n   Therefore, B must be true\n\n5. Applying this to our specific case:\n   If the book was written by James (A), then the book is a mystery novel (B)\n   The book was written by James (A is true)\n   Therefore, the book is a mystery novel (B must be true)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to conclude that the book is indeed a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: yes"
