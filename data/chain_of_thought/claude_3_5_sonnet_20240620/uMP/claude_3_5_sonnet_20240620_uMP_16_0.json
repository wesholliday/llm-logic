            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n   b) The shirt was cotton.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The shirt was cotton\n   B: The pants were denim\n\n3. The second statement confirms that A is true: The shirt was cotton.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This is a rule of inference called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We know that \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\"\n   - We also know that \"The shirt was cotton\"\n   - Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"The pants were denim\"\n\n6. This inference is valid and based on the given information, we can indeed conclude that the pants were denim.\n\nAnswer: yes"
