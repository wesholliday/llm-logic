            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad. (This is a conditional statement)\n   b) Ben ate pasta. (This is a fact)\n\n2. The conditional statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" can be broken down as:\n   - If the condition (Ben ate pasta) is true, then the result (Kate ate salad) must also be true.\n\n3. We are explicitly told that Ben ate pasta. This means the condition in the conditional statement is satisfied.\n\n4. When the condition of a conditional statement is true, and the statement itself is true, we can conclude that the result must also be true.\n\n5. Therefore, since Ben did eat pasta (satisfying the condition), and we have the conditional statement linking Ben eating pasta to Kate eating salad, we can logically conclude that Kate must have eaten salad.\n\nThis form of logical reasoning is called Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
