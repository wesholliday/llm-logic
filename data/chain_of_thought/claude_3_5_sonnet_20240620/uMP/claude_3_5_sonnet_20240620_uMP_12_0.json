            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n   b) Joe went to the park.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Joe went to the park\n   B: Lucy went to the zoo\n\n3. The second statement confirms that A is true: Joe did indeed go to the park.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This is a rule of inference called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\n   - We know that Joe went to the park\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that Lucy went to the zoo\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw a definite conclusion about Lucy going to the zoo based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
