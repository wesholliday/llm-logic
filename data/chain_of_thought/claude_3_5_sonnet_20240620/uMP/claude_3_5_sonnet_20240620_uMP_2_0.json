We are given two statements:\n   a) If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n   b) The griffin was in the forest.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the griffin was in the forest\"\n   B = \"the unicorn was in the forest\"\n\n3. The second statement directly affirms that A is true (the griffin was indeed in the forest).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This logical rule is called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\" (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest)\n   - We know A is true (The griffin was in the forest)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that B is true (The unicorn was in the forest)\n\n6. This logical deduction allows us to infer that the unicorn was in the forest based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
