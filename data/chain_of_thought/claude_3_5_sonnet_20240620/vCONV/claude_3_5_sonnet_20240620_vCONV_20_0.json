This form of argument is known as the converse of the original statement. The converse switches the antecedent (if part) and the consequent (then part) of the original statement.\n\n3. In formal logic, the converse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that the truth of the original statement does not guarantee the truth of its converse.\n\n4. Let's consider a concrete example to illustrate this:\n   Original: If it's raining (A), then the ground is wet (B).\n   Converse: If the ground is wet (B), then it's raining (A).\n\n5. We can see that while the original statement is always true, the converse is not necessarily true. The ground could be wet for other reasons (like a sprinkler), even if it's not raining.\n\n6. Applying this to our apple and banana example:\n   The premise tells us that red apple implies yellow banana.\n   But this doesn't necessarily mean that yellow banana implies red apple.\n   The banana could be yellow for reasons unrelated to the apple's color.\n\n7. For an argument to be logically valid, it must be impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. In this case, it's possible for the premise to be true (if red apple, then yellow banana) while the conclusion is false (yellow banana, but not red apple).\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
