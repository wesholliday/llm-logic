            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   Conclusion: If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\n\n2. In logical terms, we can represent this as:\n   Premise: M \u2192 S\n   Conclusion: S \u2192 M\n   (Where M represents \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S represents \"Sue was at the wedding\")\n\n3. The question is asking if this form of argument is logically valid. An argument is logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises.\n\n4. To determine this, we need to consider all possible scenarios:\n   a) Both Mary and Sue were at the wedding\n   b) Mary was at the wedding, but Sue wasn't\n   c) Sue was at the wedding, but Mary wasn't\n   d) Neither Mary nor Sue were at the wedding\n\n5. The premise (M \u2192 S) only rules out scenario b. It allows for scenarios a, c, and d.\n\n6. The conclusion (S \u2192 M) is not necessarily true given just the premise. Specifically, scenario c (Sue at the wedding, Mary not) is consistent with the premise but contradicts the conclusion.\n\n7. Since there's a scenario where the premise is true but the conclusion could be false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
