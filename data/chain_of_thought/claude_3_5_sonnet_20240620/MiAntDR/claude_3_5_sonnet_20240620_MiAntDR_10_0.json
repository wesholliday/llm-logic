            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The document might be signed or notarized.\"\n2. This statement uses the word \"or,\" which indicates that either one or both of these conditions could be true.\n3. The statement presents two possibilities for the document: it might be signed, or it might be notarized, or it might be both.\n4. The question asks if we can infer \"The document might be notarized\" from this statement.\n5. Since the original statement explicitly includes the possibility of the document being notarized, we can indeed infer that the document might be notarized.\n6. The use of \"might\" in both statements preserves the uncertainty present in the original statement.\n7. The inference doesn't exclude the possibility of the document being signed; it simply focuses on one of the two possibilities mentioned in the original statement.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
