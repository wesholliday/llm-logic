            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled.\"\n\n2. This statement presents two possibilities for the meeting:\n   a) It might be at 2 PM\n   b) It might be cancelled\n\n3. The word \"or\" indicates that these are alternative possibilities, meaning either one could be true.\n\n4. The statement we're trying to infer is \"The meeting might be cancelled.\"\n\n5. This inference focuses on just one of the two possibilities mentioned in the original statement.\n\n6. Since the original statement explicitly includes cancellation as a possibility, it directly supports the inference.\n\n7. The use of \"might\" in both statements maintains the level of uncertainty, making the inference consistent with the original statement.\n\n8. The inference doesn't exclude the other possibility (the meeting being at 2 PM), it simply highlights one of the options presented in the original statement.\n\n9. Therefore, the inference \"The meeting might be cancelled\" is a valid and direct conclusion from the original statement, as it's one of the explicitly stated possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes"
