            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The application might be completed online or in person.\"\n\n2. This statement uses the word \"or,\" which indicates that there are two possible options for completing the application.\n\n3. The two options presented are:\n   a) Online\n   b) In person\n\n4. The use of \"might\" suggests that both options are possibilities, not certainties.\n\n5. The question asks if we can infer: \"The application might be completed in person.\"\n\n6. Since \"in person\" is explicitly mentioned as one of the two options in the original statement, and the word \"might\" is preserved, this inference is directly supported by the original statement.\n\n7. The inference does not add any new information or make any assumptions beyond what is clearly stated in the original sentence.\n\n8. Therefore, we can confidently infer that \"The application might be completed in person\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
