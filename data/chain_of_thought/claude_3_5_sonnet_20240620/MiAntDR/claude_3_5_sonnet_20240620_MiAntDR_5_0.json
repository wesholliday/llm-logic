            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow.\"\n\n2. This statement presents two possibilities for the delivery: today or tomorrow.\n\n3. The word \"might\" indicates uncertainty and suggests that either of these options is possible.\n\n4. The statement uses \"or,\" which in this context is inclusive, meaning it could be one or the other, or potentially both (although in reality, a package is typically delivered once).\n\n5. The question asks if we can infer \"The package might be delivered tomorrow\" from the original statement.\n\n6. Since the original statement explicitly includes tomorrow as a possible delivery day, and maintains the uncertainty with \"might,\" we can indeed infer this.\n\n7. The inference doesn't eliminate the possibility of delivery today, but it accurately represents one of the possibilities presented in the original statement.\n\n8. The inference is actually a subset of the information provided in the original statement, making it a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
