            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The fribble might be in the blurble or on the wumble.\"\n\n2. This statement presents two possibilities for the location of the fribble:\n   a) It might be in the blurble\n   b) It might be on the wumble\n\n3. The word \"or\" indicates that these are separate possibilities, and at least one of them could be true.\n\n4. The question asks if we can infer: \"The fribble might be on the wumble.\"\n\n5. This statement is directly included as one of the possibilities in the original sentence.\n\n6. The original sentence does not exclude or contradict this possibility; in fact, it explicitly states it as one of the options.\n\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The fribble might be on the wumble\" from the original statement, as it is a direct subset of the information given.\n\n8. It's important to note that we cannot say for certain that the fribble is on the wumble, only that it might be, which is consistent with the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
