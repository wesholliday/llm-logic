We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The dog was inside\"\n   b) \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"The dog was inside\"\n   B = \"The cat was outside\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of reasoning is called Modus Ponens. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n4. In this case:\n   - We have the conditional statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\"\n   - We are told that \"The dog was inside\", which matches the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement\n\n5. Since the condition in the \"if\" part is met (the dog is indeed inside), we can logically conclude that the \"then\" part must also be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that \"The cat was outside\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
