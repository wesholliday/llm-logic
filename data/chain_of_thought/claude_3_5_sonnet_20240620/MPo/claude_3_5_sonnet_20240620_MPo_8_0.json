            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) The vampire was awake\n   b) If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"The vampire was awake\"\n   B = \"The mummy was awake\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of reasoning is called Modus Ponens. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n4. In this case, we know that A is true because the first given statement directly tells us \"The vampire was awake\".\n\n5. Since we have both the conditional statement and the confirmation that its antecedent (the \"if\" part) is true, we can logically conclude that the consequent (the \"then\" part) must also be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The mummy was awake\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
