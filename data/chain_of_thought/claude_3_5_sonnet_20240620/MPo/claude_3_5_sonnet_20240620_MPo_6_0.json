            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Sue chose pizza\"\n   b) \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"Sue chose pizza\"\n   B = \"Bob chose pasta\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of reasoning is called Modus Ponens. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n4. In our case:\n   - We have the conditional statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\"\n   - We are told that \"Sue chose pizza\" is true\n\n5. Since the condition in the \"if\" part of the statement is met (Sue did choose pizza), we can logically conclude that the \"then\" part must also be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"Bob chose pasta\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
