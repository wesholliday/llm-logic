            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The doll was plastic\"\n   b) \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"The doll was plastic\"\n   B = \"The truck was metal\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of reasoning is called Modus Ponens. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n4. In our case:\n   - We have the conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n   - We also know that the antecedent (A) is true: \"The doll was plastic\"\n\n5. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the consequent (B) must also be true: \"The truck was metal\"\n\nThis is a valid logical inference based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
