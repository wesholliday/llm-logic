            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   b) \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n2. The first statement is a simple factual claim. It asserts that Mary was indeed at the wedding.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement. It establishes a logical relationship between Mary's presence and Sue's presence at the wedding.\n\n4. In logical terms, this is a classic example of a rule of inference called Modus Ponens. The structure is:\n   - If P, then Q\n   - P is true\n   - Therefore, Q is true\n\n5. In this case:\n   - P is \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   - Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n6. We know that P is true (Mary was at the wedding), and we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\".\n\n7. According to the rule of Modus Ponens, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can logically conclude that Q must also be true.\n\n8. Therefore, we can indeed infer that Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
