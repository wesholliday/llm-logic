            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) Sam took a plane\n   b) If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   - A: Sam took a plane\n   - B: Erin took a train\n\n3. We know that the antecedent (A) of this conditional statement is true because it's given to us in the first statement.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This is a basic rule of inference called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have: If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\n   - We know: Sam took a plane\n   - Therefore, we can conclude: Erin took a train\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw the conclusion that Erin took a train based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
