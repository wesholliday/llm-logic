            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The apple was red\"\n   b) \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, often represented as \"If A, then B\". In this case:\n   A = \"The apple was red\"\n   B = \"The banana was yellow\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of reasoning is called Modus Ponens. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n4. We know from the first given statement that \"The apple was red\" is true. This satisfies the condition A in our conditional statement.\n\n5. Since the condition A is met (the apple is indeed red), and we have the conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\", we can logically conclude that the consequent B must also be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that \"The banana was yellow\".\n\nThis inference is logically valid based on the given information and the rules of propositional logic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
