            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The book was written by James\"\n   b) \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n2. The first statement is a simple factual claim. It asserts that James is the author of the book.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement. It has the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the book was written by James\"\n   B = \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n4. In logic, this type of reasoning is called Modus Ponens. The structure is:\n   If A, then B\n   A is true\n   Therefore, B is true\n\n5. In our case:\n   If the book was written by James (A), then the book is a mystery novel (B)\n   The book was written by James (A is true)\n   Therefore, the book is a mystery novel (B is true)\n\n6. Since we have confirmed that the antecedent (A) is true from the first given statement, and we have the conditional statement linking A to B, we can logically conclude that the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and using the principle of Modus Ponens, we can indeed infer that \"The book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
