            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The car was red\"\n   b) \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"The car was red\"\n   B = \"The truck was blue\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of reasoning is called Modus Ponens. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n4. In our case:\n   - We have the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n   - We are told that \"The car was red\", which satisfies the condition A\n\n5. Since the condition A is met (the car is indeed red), we can logically conclude that the consequent B must also be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that \"The truck was blue\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
