            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Joe went to the park\"\n   b) \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (Joe went to the park) is true, then the second part (Lucy went to the zoo) must also be true.\n\n3. We know from the first given statement that \"Joe went to the park\" is indeed true.\n\n4. Since \"Joe went to the park\" is true, and we have a conditional statement that says \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\", we can conclude that the second part of the conditional must also be true.\n\n5. This type of logical inference is called Modus Ponens. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\n6. In this case, P is \"Joe went to the park\" (which we know is true), and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\n7. Therefore, based on the given information and using the principle of Modus Ponens, we can logically infer that \"Lucy went to the zoo\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
