            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Tom watched football\"\n   b) \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement, often referred to as an \"if-then\" statement. It establishes a relationship between two events.\n\n3. In logic, this type of reasoning is called Modus Ponens. It follows the structure:\n   - If P, then Q\n   - P is true\n   - Therefore, Q is true\n\n4. In our case:\n   - P is \"Tom watched football\"\n   - Q is \"Jen watched basketball\"\n\n5. We know that P is true because it's given in the first statement.\n\n6. The conditional statement tells us that if P is true, then Q must also be true.\n\n7. Since we've established that P is indeed true, we can conclude that Q must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and using the principle of Modus Ponens, we can logically infer that \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
