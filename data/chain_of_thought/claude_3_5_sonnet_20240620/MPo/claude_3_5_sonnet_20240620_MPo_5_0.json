            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Jeff played basketball\"\n   b) \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (Jeff played basketball) is true, then the second part (Amy played tennis) must also be true.\n\n3. We know from the first given statement that \"Jeff played basketball\" is indeed true.\n\n4. Since the condition in the conditional statement is met (Jeff did play basketball), we can conclude that the consequence must also be true.\n\n5. Therefore, based on these two statements, we can logically infer that \"Amy played tennis\".\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical inference called Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
