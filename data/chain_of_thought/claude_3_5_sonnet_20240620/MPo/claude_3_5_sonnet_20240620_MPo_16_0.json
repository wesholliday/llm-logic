            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The shirt was cotton\"\n   b) \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"The shirt was cotton\"\n   B = \"The pants were denim\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of reasoning is called Modus Ponens. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n4. In this case:\n   - We have the conditional statement \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\"\n   - We also know that \"The shirt was cotton\" is true (given in the first statement)\n\n5. Since the condition in the \"if\" part of the statement is met (the shirt is indeed cotton), we can logically conclude that the \"then\" part must also be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that \"The pants were denim\" is a true statement based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
