            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Alex finished the race\"\n   b) \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the first part (Alex finishing the race) is true, then the second part (Chris finishing the race) must also be true.\n\n3. We know from the first given statement that \"Alex finished the race\" is true.\n\n4. Since we know Alex finished the race, and we have a conditional statement that says \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\", we can apply a logical rule called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Modus Ponens states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\n6. In this case:\n   P = \"Alex finished the race\"\n   Q = \"Chris finished the race\"\n\n7. We know P is true, and we have the conditional statement \"If P, then Q\". Therefore, we can conclude that Q is true.\n\n8. Thus, we can logically infer that \"Chris finished the race\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
