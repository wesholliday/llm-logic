            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n   b) The mummy was awake.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   B = \"the mummy was awake\"\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B is true (the mummy was awake).\n\n4. However, we need to be careful here. The conditional statement \"If A, then B\" only tells us that when A is true, B must be true. It doesn't necessarily mean that when B is true, A must be true.\n\n5. In logical terms, we can't conclude A from knowing that B is true. This is because there could be other reasons for B to be true that don't involve A.\n\n6. For example, it's possible that the mummy was awake for reasons unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\n7. The given information doesn't rule out the possibility that the vampire was asleep while the mummy was awake.\n\n8. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\" - assuming that because the consequent (B) is true, the antecedent (A) must also be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically conclude that the vampire was definitely awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
