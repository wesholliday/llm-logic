            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". This means that if the antecedent (A) is true, the consequent (B) must be true. However, it doesn't necessarily work in reverse.\n\n3. We know that Sue was at the wedding (statement b). This confirms the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\n4. However, confirming the consequent doesn't allow us to conclude anything about the antecedent. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\".\n\n5. To illustrate why this doesn't work, consider this example:\n   If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n   The ground is wet.\n   Does this mean it's raining? Not necessarily. The ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n6. Similarly, in our case, Sue could have been at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's presence. Mary's presence is sufficient for Sue's presence, but not necessary.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information. We only know that if Mary was there, Sue would have been there too, and that Sue was indeed there.\n\nAnswer: no"
