            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". In this case:\n   A = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B is true (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n4. However, we need to be careful here. The conditional statement \"If A, then B\" only tells us that when A is true, B must be true. It doesn't necessarily work the other way around.\n\n5. In logical terms, we can conclude B from A, but we cannot always conclude A from B. This is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\n6. In this specific scenario:\n   - We know that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   - We also know that Mark did buy the blue shirt.\n   - But this doesn't necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n7. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt, unrelated to Lisa's purchase.\n\n8. Therefore, while it's possible that Lisa bought the red shirt, we cannot logically conclude this based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
