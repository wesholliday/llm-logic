We're given two statements:\n   a) If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n   b) It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that B is not true: \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   - If A (Sue chose pizza), then B (Bob must have chosen pasta)\n   - We know that B is false (It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta)\n   - Therefore, A must also be false (Sue did not choose pizza)\n\n6. This logical deduction allows us to conclude that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
