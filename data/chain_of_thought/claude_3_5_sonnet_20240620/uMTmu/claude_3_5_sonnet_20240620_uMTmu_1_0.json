            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n   b) It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   This is a conditional statement of the form: If A, then B.\n   Where A = \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B = \"Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B: \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   This means B is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   - We know that if A (Mary was at the wedding) is true, then B (Sue must have been at the wedding) must be true.\n   - We also know that B is false.\n   - Therefore, A must be false.\n\n6. If A is false, it means that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
