            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n   b) It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   B = \"the mummy must have been awake\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that B is false: \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\"\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this principle to our scenario:\n   - We know that if A is true, B must be true (from statement 1)\n   - We know that B is false (from statement 2)\n   - Therefore, A must be false\n\n6. Translating this back to our original terms:\n   - If the vampire was awake (A), the mummy must have been awake (B)\n   - The mummy was not necessarily awake (not B)\n   - Therefore, the vampire was not awake (not A)\n\nSo, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
