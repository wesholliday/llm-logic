            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n   b) It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the car was red\"\n   B = \"the truck must have been blue\"\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\"\n   This means that B is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this principle to our scenario:\n   - We know that B (the truck must have been blue) is false.\n   - We have the conditional statement \"If A, then B\"\n   - Therefore, A (the car was red) must also be false.\n\n6. If \"the car was red\" is false, then it means the car was not red.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
