            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n   b) It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\n2. Let's represent these statements symbolically:\n   G: The griffin was in the forest\n   U: The unicorn must have been in the forest\n   \n   Statement a) can be written as: G \u2192 U\n   Statement b) can be written as: \u00acU\n\n3. Now, we're using a logical rule called Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP\n\n4. In our case:\n   G \u2192 U (If griffin, then unicorn)\n   \u00acU (Not unicorn)\n   Therefore, \u00acG (Not griffin)\n\n5. This logical deduction tells us that if the unicorn wasn't necessarily in the forest (which we're told), and the griffin being in the forest would necessitate the unicorn being there, then the griffin couldn't have been in the forest.\n\n6. The logic holds because if the griffin were in the forest, it would contradict the statement that the unicorn wasn't necessarily there.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
