            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n   b) It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n   This is a conditional statement of the form: If P, then Q\n   Where P = \"Joe went to the park\" and Q = \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that Q is false: \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\"\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. To understand why, consider the possibilities:\n   - If P were true, then Q would have to be true (according to the first statement).\n   - But we know Q is false (from the second statement).\n   - Therefore, P cannot be true.\n\n6. Applying this to our specific case:\n   - We know Lucy did not go to the zoo (Q is false).\n   - The conditional statement tells us that if Joe went to the park, Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n   - Since Lucy didn't go to the zoo, Joe couldn't have gone to the park.\n\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: yes"
