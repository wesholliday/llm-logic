            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n   b) It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\n2. Let's represent these statements symbolically:\n   Let C = \"the shirt was cotton\"\n   Let D = \"the pants must have been denim\"\n\n   Statement a) can be written as: C \u2192 D\n   Statement b) can be written as: \u00acD\n\n3. In logic, this form of reasoning is known as modus tollens (denying the consequent). It follows this structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n4. In our case:\n   If C, then D\n   Not D\n   Therefore, not C\n\n5. Since we know that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim (\u00acD), and we have the conditional statement \"if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\" (C \u2192 D), we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton (\u00acC).\n\n6. This conclusion is valid because if the shirt were cotton, it would necessitate that the pants were denim, but we know that's not the case.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
