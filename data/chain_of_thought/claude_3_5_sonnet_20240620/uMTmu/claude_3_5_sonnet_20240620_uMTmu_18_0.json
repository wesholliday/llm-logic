            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n   b) It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the doll was plastic\"\n   B = \"the truck must have been metal\"\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B: \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\"\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this principle to our scenario:\n   - We know that if A (the doll was plastic) is true, then B (the truck must have been metal) would be true.\n   - We're told that B is not true.\n   - Therefore, A cannot be true.\n\n6. If A (the doll was plastic) cannot be true, then we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
