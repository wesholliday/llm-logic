            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train.\n   b) It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train.\n\n2. Let's represent these statements symbolically:\n   P: Sam took a plane\n   Q: Erin must have taken a train\n   \n   Statement a) can be written as: P \u2192 Q\n   Statement b) can be written as: \u00acQ\n\n3. In logic, this structure is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP\n\n4. Applying this to our scenario:\n   We know P \u2192 Q (If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train)\n   We also know \u00acQ (It's not the case that Erin must have taken a train)\n\n5. Therefore, we can conclude \u00acP (Sam did not take a plane)\n\n6. The logic behind this is:\n   - If Sam had taken a plane, Erin must have taken a train (given in statement a)\n   - But we know Erin didn't necessarily take a train (given in statement b)\n   - So, the condition for Sam taking a plane is not met\n\n7. This means that Sam could not have taken a plane, as it would contradict the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
