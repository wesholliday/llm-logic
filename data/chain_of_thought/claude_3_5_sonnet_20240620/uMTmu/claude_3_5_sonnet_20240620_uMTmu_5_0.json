            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n   b) It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that \"It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\" This directly contradicts the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Here's why: If A were true, then B would have to be true according to the conditional statement. But we know B is not true. Therefore, A cannot be true.\n\n6. Applying this to our specific case:\n   - If Jeff played basketball (A), then Amy must have played tennis (B).\n   - We know that it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis (not B).\n   - Therefore, Jeff did not play basketball (not A).\n\n7. This logical inference is valid and allows us to conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
