            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n   b) It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the apple was red\"\n   B = \"the banana must have been yellow\"\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B. It tells us that B is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. To understand why, consider the possibilities:\n   - If A were true, then B would have to be true (according to the first statement).\n   - But we know B is false (from the second statement).\n   - Therefore, A cannot be true.\n\n6. In this case, since we know the banana was not necessarily yellow (B is false), we can conclude that the apple was not red (A is false).\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
