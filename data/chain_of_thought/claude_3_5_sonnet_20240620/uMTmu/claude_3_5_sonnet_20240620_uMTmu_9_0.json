            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n   b) It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. Let's represent these statements symbolically:\n   Let P = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\n   Let Q = \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"\n\n   Statement a) can be written as: P \u2192 Q\n   Statement b) can be written as: \u00acQ\n\n3. In logic, this structure is known as Modus Tollens. It follows the form:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n4. We can apply this logical rule to our situation:\n   If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (P \u2192 Q)\n   It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt (\u00acQ)\n   Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt (\u00acP)\n\n5. This conclusion is valid because if the first statement (P \u2192 Q) is true, and we know that Q is false, then P must also be false. If P were true, Q would have to be true according to the first statement, but we know Q is false.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
