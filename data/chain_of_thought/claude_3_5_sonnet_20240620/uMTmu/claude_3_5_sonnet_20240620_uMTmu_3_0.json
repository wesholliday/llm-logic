            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n   b) It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n\n2. Let's represent these statements symbolically:\n   J: The book was written by James\n   M: The book must be a mystery novel\n   \n   Statement a) can be written as: J \u2192 M\n   Statement b) can be written as: \u00acM\n\n3. In logic, this form of reasoning is known as modus tollens (denying the consequent). It follows the structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n4. In our case:\n   If J, then M\n   Not M\n   Therefore, not J\n\n5. This logical structure is valid. When we have a conditional statement (if-then) and we know the consequent (the \"then\" part) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (the \"if\" part) must also be false.\n\n6. Applying this to our problem:\n   We know that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel.\n   We also know that it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n   Therefore, we can conclude that James did not write the book.\n\nGiven this logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
