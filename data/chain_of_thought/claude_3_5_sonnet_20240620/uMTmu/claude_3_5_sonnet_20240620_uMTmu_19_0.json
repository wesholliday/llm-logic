            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n   b) It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\" This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\" This directly contradicts the consequent (B) of the conditional statement.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   - We know that if Tom watched football (A), then Jen must have watched basketball (B).\n   - We're told that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball (not B).\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football (not A).\n\n6. This logical inference is valid because if Tom had watched football, it would necessitate that Jen watched basketball, which we know is not the case.\n\nAnswer: yes"
