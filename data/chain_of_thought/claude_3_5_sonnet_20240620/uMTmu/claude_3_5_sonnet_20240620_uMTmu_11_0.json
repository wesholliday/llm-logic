            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n   b) It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\n2. Let's represent these statements symbolically:\n   Let C = \"The cake was chocolate\"\n   Let B = \"The muffins must have been blueberry\"\n\n   Statement a) can be written as: C \u2192 B\n   Statement b) can be written as: \u00acB (not B)\n\n3. In logic, this structure is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP\n\n4. In our case:\n   C \u2192 B (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry)\n   \u00acB (It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry)\n   Therefore, \u00acC (The cake was not chocolate)\n\n5. The logic works as follows:\n   - If the cake was chocolate, the muffins must have been blueberry.\n   - But we know the muffins were not necessarily blueberry.\n   - Therefore, the condition for the cake being chocolate was not met.\n   - Thus, the cake could not have been chocolate.\n\n6. This conclusion is valid based on the given information and the rules of logical inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
