            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\"\n   b) \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true:\n   - The book is on the shelf\n   OR\n   - The book must be resting on the table\n\n3. The second statement negates one of these options. It tells us that it's not true that the book must be resting on the table.\n\n4. In logic, when we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true. This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\n5. Since we know that it's not the case that the book must be resting on the table (from statement b), the only remaining possibility from our original OR statement is that the book is on the shelf.\n\n6. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: yes"
