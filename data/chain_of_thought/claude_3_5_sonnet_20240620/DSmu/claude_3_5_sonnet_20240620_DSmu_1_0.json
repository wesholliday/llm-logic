            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\"\n   b) \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true: either Fido is inside, or Fido must be in the garden.\n\n3. The second statement directly negates one of the options from the first statement. It tells us that it's not true that Fido must be in the garden.\n\n4. In logic, when we have an \"Either A or B\" statement, and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must be true. This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   - We know that either Fido is inside OR Fido must be in the garden.\n   - We also know that it's NOT the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n   - Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\n6. This logical deduction allows us to conclude that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
