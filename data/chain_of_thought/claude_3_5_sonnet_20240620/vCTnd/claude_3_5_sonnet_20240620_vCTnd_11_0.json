            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If P, then not Q\n   Conclusion: If Q, then not P\n   Where P = \"I went to the store\" and Q = \"I bought vegetables\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as contraposition or transposition.\n\n3. In propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4. In this case, we're starting with \"If P, then not Q\" and concluding \"If Q, then not P\".\n\n5. To check if this is valid, let's consider the truth table for the original statement and its contrapositive:\n\n   P | Q | If P, then not Q | If Q, then not P\n   T | T | F               | F\n   T | F | T               | T\n   F | T | T               | T\n   F | F | T               | T\n\n6. As we can see, the truth values for \"If P, then not Q\" and \"If Q, then not P\" are identical in all possible scenarios.\n\n7. This means that these two statements are logically equivalent. In other words, they always have the same truth value, regardless of the truth values of P and Q.\n\n8. Therefore, if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, which is the definition of a logically valid argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
