            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   P: The clothes were washed\n   Q: The clothes were washed properly\n\n2. The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed)\n\n4. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n5. Let's consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n   P \u2192 ~Q is logically equivalent to Q \u2192 ~P\n\n6. The contrapositive of the premise is identical to the conclusion.\n\n7. In propositional logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that the conclusion is directly derivable from the premise.\n\n8. Therefore, this argument form is logically valid. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premise, regardless of the actual truth values of the statements involved.\n\nAnswer: yes"
