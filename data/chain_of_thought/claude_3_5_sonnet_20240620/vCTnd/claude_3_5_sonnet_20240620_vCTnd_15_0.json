            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   P: The room was tidied\n   Q: The room was tidied thoroughly\n\n2. The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied)\n\n4. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n5. Let's consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n   P \u2192 ~Q is logically equivalent to Q \u2192 ~P\n\n6. We can see that the contrapositive of the premise is identical to the conclusion.\n\n7. In propositional logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n8. Therefore, the conclusion does indeed follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is logically valid. The conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, which is a valid logical inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
