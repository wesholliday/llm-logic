            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   P: I ate a meal\n   Q: I ate a large meal\n\n2. The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If I ate a meal, then I did not eat a large meal)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal)\n\n4. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n5. One way to check this is to consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n   Contrapositive of (P \u2192 ~Q) is (Q \u2192 ~P)\n\n6. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if P \u2192 ~Q is true, then Q \u2192 ~P must also be true.\n\n7. We can see that the contrapositive of the premise (Q \u2192 ~P) is exactly the same as the conclusion.\n\n8. Therefore, the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
