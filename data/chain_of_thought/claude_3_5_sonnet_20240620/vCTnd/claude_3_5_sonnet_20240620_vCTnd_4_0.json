            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   P: Ben studied\n   Q: Ben studied diligently\n\n2. The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study)\n\n4. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n5. Let's consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n   P \u2192 ~Q is logically equivalent to Q \u2192 ~P\n\n6. The contrapositive of the premise is identical to the conclusion.\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, we can say that the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n8. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. The conclusion is a direct logical consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
