            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   P: The meal was prepared\n   C: The meal was prepared carefully\n\n2. The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~C\n   (If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: C \u2192 ~P\n   (If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared)\n\n4. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to see if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n5. Let's consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n   P \u2192 ~C is logically equivalent to C \u2192 ~P\n\n6. The contrapositive of the premise is identical to the conclusion.\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n8. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. The conclusion is a direct logical consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
