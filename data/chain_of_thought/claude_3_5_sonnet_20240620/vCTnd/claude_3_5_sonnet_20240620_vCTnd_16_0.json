            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the premise and conclusion:\n   Premise: If P, then not Q\n   Conclusion: If Q, then not P\n   Where P = \"the job was completed\" and Q = \"it was completed well\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as contraposition or transposition.\n\n3. In propositional logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\".\n\n4. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\n5. In our case, the conclusion is indeed the contrapositive of the premise:\n   Premise: If P, then not Q\n   Contrapositive (Conclusion): If Q, then not P\n\n6. Since the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\n7. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on the truth of the premises or conclusion, but on the form of the argument. Even if the statements about job completion seem odd in real-world context, the logical form remains valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
