The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise)\n\n4. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n5. Let's consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n   P \u2192 ~Q is logically equivalent to Q \u2192 ~P\n\n6. We can see that the contrapositive of the premise is identical to the conclusion.\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, and the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premise.\n\n8. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. The conclusion is a direct logical consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
