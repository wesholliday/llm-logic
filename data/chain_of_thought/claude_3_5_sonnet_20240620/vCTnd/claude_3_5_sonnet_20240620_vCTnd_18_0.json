The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If P, then not Q)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If Q, then not P)\n\n4. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n5. Let's consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n   P \u2192 ~Q is logically equivalent to Q \u2192 ~P\n\n6. We can see that the contrapositive of the premise is identical to the conclusion.\n\n7. In propositional logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that the conclusion is directly derivable from the premise.\n\n8. Therefore, this argument form is logically valid. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premise, regardless of the actual truth values of the statements involved.\n\nAnswer: yes"
