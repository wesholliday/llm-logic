The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If P, then not Q)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If Q, then not P)\n\n4. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n5. Let's consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n   P \u2192 ~Q is logically equivalent to Q \u2192 ~P\n\n6. The contrapositive of the premise is identical to the conclusion.\n\n7. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, and the conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premise.\n\n8. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. The conclusion is a direct logical consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
