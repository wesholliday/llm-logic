            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   P: Directions were provided\n   Q: Directions were explained clearly\n\n2. The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If P, then not Q)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If Q, then not P)\n\n4. Now, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, does P \u2192 ~Q imply Q \u2192 ~P?\n\n5. To check this, let's consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n   The contrapositive of P \u2192 ~Q is Q \u2192 ~P\n\n6. The contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that P \u2192 ~Q and Q \u2192 ~P are logically equivalent.\n\n7. Since the conclusion (Q \u2192 ~P) is identical to the contrapositive of the premise, and the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original premise, we can conclude that the argument is logically valid.\n\n8. In other words, if we accept the premise as true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
