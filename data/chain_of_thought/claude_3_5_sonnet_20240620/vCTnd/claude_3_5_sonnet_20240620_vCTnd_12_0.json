            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If Jane studied, then she did not study long\n   Conclusion: If Jane studied long, then she did not study\n\n2. Let's assign variables to simplify:\n   S: Jane studied\n   L: Jane studied long\n\n3. Now we can rewrite the argument in logical form:\n   Premise: S \u2192 ~L\n   Conclusion: L \u2192 ~S\n\n4. This argument form is known as contraposition. In contraposition, we negate both parts of the conditional statement and reverse their order.\n\n5. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". This is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n6. In our case:\n   Original (premise): S \u2192 ~L\n   Contrapositive: L \u2192 ~S\n\n7. As we can see, the conclusion of the argument is exactly the contrapositive of the premise.\n\n8. Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, this argument form is indeed valid. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
