            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   P: Instructions were given\n   Q: Instructions were explained clearly\n\n2. The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If P, then not Q)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If Q, then not P)\n\n4. Now, we need to determine if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. In other words, does P \u2192 ~Q imply Q \u2192 ~P?\n\n5. To check this, we can use the logical law of contraposition. This law states that a conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive.\n\n6. The contrapositive of P \u2192 ~Q is Q \u2192 ~P\n\n7. This is exactly the same as our conclusion!\n\n8. Therefore, the conclusion is indeed the contrapositive of the premise, which means it is logically equivalent to the premise.\n\n9. Since the conclusion is logically equivalent to the premise, it must follow logically from the premise.\n\n10. Thus, this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
