            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\n   Conclusion: If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\n\n2. We can represent this symbolically:\n   Premise: R \u2192 ~H (where R is \"it's raining\" and H is \"it's raining hard\")\n   Conclusion: H \u2192 ~R\n\n3. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise in all possible cases.\n\n4. Let's consider the possible truth values:\n   - If R is true and H is false, the premise is true.\n   - If R is false, the premise is true regardless of H (because of how material implication works).\n   - If R is true and H is true, the premise is false.\n\n5. The conclusion (H \u2192 ~R) is the contrapositive of the premise (R \u2192 ~H).\n\n6. In propositional logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, and vice versa.\n\n7. Therefore, this argument form is indeed logically valid. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premise in all possible cases where the premise is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
