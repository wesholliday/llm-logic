The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If a recommendation was made, then it was not a strong recommendation)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If a strong recommendation was made, then a recommendation was not made)\n\n4. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n5. Let's consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n   P \u2192 ~Q is logically equivalent to Q \u2192 ~P\n\n6. The contrapositive of the premise is exactly the same as the conclusion.\n\n7. Since the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, the conclusion is indeed logically equivalent to the premise.\n\n8. Therefore, the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise, making this argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
