            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   P: The customer was greeted\n   Q: The customer was greeted warmly\n\n2. The premise can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly)\n\n3. The conclusion can be written as: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted)\n\n4. To determine if this argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n\n5. Let's consider the contrapositive of the premise:\n   P \u2192 ~Q is logically equivalent to Q \u2192 ~P\n\n6. The contrapositive of the premise is exactly the same as the conclusion.\n\n7. In propositional logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that the conclusion is a direct logical consequence of the premise.\n\n8. Therefore, this form of argument is indeed logically valid. The conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
