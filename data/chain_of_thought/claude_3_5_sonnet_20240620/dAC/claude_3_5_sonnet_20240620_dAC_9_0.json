            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B is true (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is related to a common fallacy called \"affirming the consequent.\" It occurs when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know B is true, but we incorrectly conclude that A must also be true.\n\n5. The conditional statement only tells us that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark definitely bought the blue shirt. It doesn't say anything about what happens if Mark bought the blue shirt independently.\n\n6. There could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt that have nothing to do with Lisa's purchase. For example, he might have liked the shirt or needed a blue shirt for some other reason.\n\n7. Therefore, knowing that Mark bought the blue shirt doesn't necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt. We can't deduce Lisa's action from the information given.\n\nAnswer: no"
