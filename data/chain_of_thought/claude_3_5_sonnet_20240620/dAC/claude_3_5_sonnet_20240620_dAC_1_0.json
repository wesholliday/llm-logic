            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". It doesn't tell us that A (Mary being at the wedding) actually happened, only that if it did, then B (Sue being at the wedding) would also be true.\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B (Sue being at the wedding) is true.\n\n4. However, just because B is true, we can't necessarily conclude that A is true. This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if A is true, not what happens if B is true.\n\n5. In logical terms, this is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. We can't deduce the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding) from the consequent (Sue being at the wedding) being true.\n\n6. To illustrate this, consider that Sue could have been at the wedding for other reasons, regardless of whether Mary was there or not.\n\n7. The only thing we can deduce from these statements is that if Mary wasn't at the wedding, it wouldn't contradict either of the given statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically deduce that Mary was at the wedding from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
