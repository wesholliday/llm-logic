            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's clarify the premise and conclusion:\n   Premise: It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n   Conclusion: Mary might not have been at the wedding.\n\n2. We need to understand what these statements mean in terms of modal logic:\n   - \"must have been\" implies necessity\n   - \"might not have been\" implies possibility of absence\n\n3. The premise, \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding,\" can be interpreted as:\n   - It's not necessary that Mary was at the wedding.\n   - There's no absolute requirement or certainty that Mary attended.\n\n4. The conclusion, \"Mary might not have been at the wedding,\" means:\n   - It's possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\n   - There's a chance, however small, that Mary didn't attend.\n\n5. Now, let's consider the logical relationship:\n   - If it's not necessary that Mary was at the wedding (premise),\n   - Then it must be possible that she wasn't at the wedding (conclusion).\n\n6. This is because in modal logic, if something is not necessary, its negation must be possible.\n   - Not necessary (P) implies possibly not (P)\n\n7. Therefore, the conclusion directly follows from the premise. If it's not the case that Mary must have been there, then by logical necessity, it's possible that she wasn't there.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this form of argument is logically valid. The conclusion is a direct logical consequence of the premise.\n\nAnswer: yes"
