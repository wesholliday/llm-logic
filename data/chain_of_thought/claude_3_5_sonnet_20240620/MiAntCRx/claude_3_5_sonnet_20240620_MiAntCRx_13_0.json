This statement suggests that \"zibber\" is something the wobble might do.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The wobble might wump and zibber.\"\n4. This new statement adds an additional action: \"wump.\"\n5. While the original statement allows for the possibility of the wobble zibbering, it does not mention or imply anything about \"wumping.\"\n6. Adding \"wump\" introduces new information that is not present or implied in the original statement.\n7. We cannot logically infer additional actions or possibilities that are not mentioned or implied in the original statement.\n8. Therefore, we cannot conclude that \"The wobble might wump and zibber\" based solely on the information given in \"The wobble might zibber.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
