            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   Premise 2: Sue was at the wedding.\n   Conclusion: Mary was at the wedding.\n\n2. This argument form is known as \"affirming the consequent.\" It's a common logical fallacy.\n\n3. Let's break down the first premise:\n   - If P, then Q (where P is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and Q is \"Sue was at the wedding\")\n\n4. The second premise affirms Q (Sue was at the wedding).\n\n5. The conclusion then asserts P (Mary was at the wedding).\n\n6. However, this reasoning is not logically valid. Just because the consequent (Q) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (P) is true.\n\n7. To illustrate why this is invalid, consider this example with the same logical structure:\n   - If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n   - The ground is wet.\n   - Therefore, it's raining.\n\n8. We can see that this isn't valid because the ground could be wet for other reasons (like a sprinkler), even if it's not raining.\n\n9. For the original argument to be valid, we would need the reverse of the first premise: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\n10. Without this, we can't logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding just because Sue was there.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
