            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\"\n   b) \"The wug was sproinged\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: \"the wug was sproinged\"\n   B: \"it was garpled\"\n\n3. The second statement affirms that A is true: \"The wug was sproinged\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario follows a rule called Modus Ponens, which states:\n   If we have \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n5. Applying this rule to our scenario:\n   We have \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" (If A, then B)\n   We know \"The wug was sproinged\" (A is true)\n   Therefore, we can conclude \"It was garpled\" (B is true)\n\n6. The conclusion \"It was garpled\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
