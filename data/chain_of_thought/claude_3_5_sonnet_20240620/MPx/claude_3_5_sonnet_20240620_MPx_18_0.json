            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\"\n   b) \"The shank was plooked\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The shank was plooked\n   B: The shank was nugged\n\n3. This conditional statement tells us that whenever A is true, B must also be true.\n\n4. The second statement directly affirms that A is true: \"The shank was plooked\"\n\n5. Since we know that A is true, and we have a rule stating that when A is true, B must also be true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that \"The shank was nugged\"\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical inference rule called Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
