            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\"\n   b) \"The grommet was sploffed\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the grommet was sploffed\"\n   B = \"the grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n3. The second statement directly affirms that A is true: \"The grommet was sploffed\"\n\n4. In logic, this structure is known as Modus Ponens, which states:\n   If A, then B\n   A is true\n   Therefore, B is true\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If the grommet was sploffed (A), then the grommet plopped the frink (B)\n   The grommet was sploffed (A is true)\n   Therefore, the grommet plopped the frink (B must be true)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to conclude that \"The grommet plopped the frink\" is true based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
