            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The dreb was not vroombed\"\n   b) \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\"\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the dreb was vroombed\"\n   B = \"the dreb was spened\"\n\n3. We know from the first statement that A is false (the dreb was NOT vroombed).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. Therefore, we don't have enough information to determine whether the dreb was spened or not. It's possible that the dreb could be spened for reasons other than being vroombed, or it might not be spened at all.\n\n6. Since we can't determine whether the dreb was spened or not, we cannot infer that \"The dreb was not spened\".\n\nAnswer: no"
