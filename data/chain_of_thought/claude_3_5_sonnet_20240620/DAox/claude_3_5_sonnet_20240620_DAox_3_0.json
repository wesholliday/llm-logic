            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) The splat was not morphed\n   b) If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the splat was morphed\"\n   B = \"the splat quanked\"\n\n3. Statement (a) directly negates the antecedent (A) of the conditional statement.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. In this case, we know the splat was not morphed, but we don't have any information about whether it quanked or not when it's not morphed.\n\n6. The conditional statement only tells us what would happen if the splat was morphed, but it doesn't give us any information about what happens when the splat is not morphed.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer whether the splat quanked or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
