            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) The sprocket was not cranked.\n   b) If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   If (sprocket was cranked), then (sprocket was daggled)\n\n3. We know that the sprocket was not cranked. This means the antecedent (the \"if\" part) of the conditional statement is false.\n\n4. In logic, when the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the entire statement is considered true regardless of whether the consequent (the \"then\" part) is true or false. This is known as \"vacuous truth\".\n\n5. However, the fact that the antecedent is false doesn't tell us anything about whether the consequent is true or false. In other words, knowing that the sprocket was not cranked doesn't give us any information about whether it was daggled or not.\n\n6. The sprocket could have been daggled for reasons other than being cranked, or it might not have been daggled at all. We simply don't have enough information to determine its daggled state.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The sprocket was not daggled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: no"
