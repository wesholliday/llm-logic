            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The package must have been signed for.\"\n\n2. This statement only tells us that the package was signed for at some point. It doesn't provide any information about when the package was delivered.\n\n3. The inference we're asked about adds a specific time element: \"The package must have been delivered yesterday and signed for.\"\n\n4. While it's true that packages are typically signed for upon delivery, we can't assume that the delivery happened yesterday based solely on the original statement.\n\n5. The original statement could be true for a package delivered yesterday, today, last week, or any time in the past. We simply don't have enough information to determine when the delivery occurred.\n\n6. Adding \"yesterday\" to the statement introduces new information that isn't supported by or implied in the original statement.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the package was delivered specifically yesterday based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
