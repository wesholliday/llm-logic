            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The application must have included references.\"\n\n2. The inferred statement adds an additional condition: \"The application must have been completed online and included references.\"\n\n3. The original statement only specifies one requirement: the inclusion of references.\n\n4. The inferred statement includes two requirements: completing the application online and including references.\n\n5. While the requirement for references is present in both statements, the original statement does not mention anything about the application being completed online.\n\n6. We cannot assume that the application must be completed online based solely on the information given in the original statement.\n\n7. The inferred statement is more specific and restrictive than the original statement, adding a condition that is not present in the original.\n\n8. In logical reasoning, we cannot infer additional conditions or requirements that are not explicitly stated or logically implied by the given information.\n\n9. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the application must have been completed online based on the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
