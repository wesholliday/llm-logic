            "content": "Explanation: Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given statement is \"The document must have been notarized.\"\n\n2. Notarization is a process where a notary public witnesses the signing of a document and verifies the identity of the signer(s).\n\n3. For a document to be notarized, it must first be signed in the presence of the notary public.\n\n4. The notary then adds their own signature and seal to the document, certifying that they witnessed the signing.\n\n5. Therefore, the act of notarization inherently includes the act of signing the document.\n\n6. If a document \"must have been notarized,\" it logically follows that it must also have been signed, as signing is a necessary prerequisite for notarization.\n\n7. However, it's important to note that the original statement doesn't explicitly mention signing. It only states that the document must have been notarized.\n\n8. Despite this, we can confidently infer that signing must have occurred based on our understanding of the notarization process.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that if a document must have been notarized, it must also have been signed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
