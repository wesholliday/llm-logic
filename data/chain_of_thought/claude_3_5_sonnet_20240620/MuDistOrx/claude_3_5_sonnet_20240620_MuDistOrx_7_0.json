            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The blimple must be zump or be zibber\"\n\n2. This statement uses the word \"or\" to present two alternatives for the blimple's state.\n\n3. The word \"must\" at the beginning applies to both alternatives, as it's not repeated before \"be zibber\".\n\n4. In formal logic, when a modal operator (like \"must\") is applied to a disjunction (an \"or\" statement), it distributes over both parts.\n\n5. This means that \"must (A or B)\" is logically equivalent to \"must A or must B\".\n\n6. Applying this to our statement, \"The blimple must be zump or be zibber\" is logically equivalent to \"The blimple must be zump or the blimple must be zibber\".\n\n7. The proposed inference, \"The blimple must be zump or it must be zibber\", is just a slight rephrasing of this, using \"it\" to refer back to \"the blimple\" in the second part.\n\n8. This rephrasing doesn't change the logical meaning of the statement.\n\nTherefore, the proposed inference is a valid logical equivalent of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
