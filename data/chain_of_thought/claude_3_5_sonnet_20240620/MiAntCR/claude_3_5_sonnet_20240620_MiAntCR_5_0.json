            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The package might be signed for.\"\n2. This statement only tells us about the possibility of the package being signed for. It doesn't provide any information about when this might happen.\n3. The proposed inference adds a new element: \"The package might be delivered today.\"\n4. While it's true that packages are often signed for upon delivery, the original statement doesn't specify anything about the timing of the delivery or signing.\n5. The word \"might\" in the original statement indicates uncertainty, but it's specifically about the signing, not about the delivery date.\n6. By adding \"delivered today,\" we're introducing new information that isn't present or implied in the original statement.\n7. The package could potentially be signed for tomorrow, next week, or at any other time. There's no indication that it must be today.\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the package will be delivered specifically today based solely on the information given.\n\nIn conclusion, while the original statement allows for the possibility of the package being signed for, it doesn't provide any basis for inferring that this will happen today. Adding this time element goes beyond the information provided in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
