            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The application might include references.\"\n\n2. The inferred statement is \"The application might be completed online and include references.\"\n\n3. The original statement only mentions that the application might include references. It doesn't specify anything about how the application is completed.\n\n4. The inferred statement adds a new piece of information: that the application might be completed online.\n\n5. While it's possible that the application could be completed online, we cannot infer this from the given information. The original statement doesn't provide any details about the method of application submission.\n\n6. The inferred statement does include the original information about references, but it also adds an assumption about the application process that isn't supported by the original statement.\n\n7. In logical reasoning, we cannot add new information or make assumptions that aren't directly supported by the given facts.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one, as it contains additional information not present in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
