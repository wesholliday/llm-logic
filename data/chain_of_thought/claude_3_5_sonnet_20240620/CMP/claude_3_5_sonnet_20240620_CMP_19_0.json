    "user_prompt": "Suppose that rents, home prices, and mortgage rates are expected to increase this year. Economists project rents likely will increase the most, followed by home prices, with mortgage rates rising much less. These are the only major housing costs expected to rise substantially, so if home prices don\u2019t increase the most, then if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. Moreover, rents likely will increase the most and hence home prices likely won\u2019t increase the most. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if rents don\u2019t increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We're given three housing costs that are expected to increase: rents, home prices, and mortgage rates.\n\n2. The projected order of increase is: rents > home prices > mortgage rates.\n\n3. We're told that if home prices don't increase the most, then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most. This is a conditional statement.\n\n4. We're also told that rents likely will increase the most, and consequently, home prices likely won't increase the most.\n\n5. The question asks if it's likely that, if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\n6. To answer this, we need to consider what happens if rents don't increase the most, despite it being likely that they will.\n\n7. If rents don't increase the most, we know that either home prices or mortgage rates must increase the most.\n\n8. We were given that home prices likely won't increase the most.\n\n9. We were also given that if home prices don't increase the most (which is likely), then if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\n10. Combining points 8 and 9, we can conclude that if rents don't increase the most (despite it being unlikely), it's likely that mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nTherefore, it does follow that it's likely that, if rents don't increase the most, mortgage rates will increase the most.\n\nAnswer: yes"
