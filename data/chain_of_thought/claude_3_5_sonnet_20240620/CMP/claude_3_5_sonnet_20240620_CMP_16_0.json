    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Uber, Lyft, and taxis are the main transportation options in a city. According to ridership data, Uber likely will have the most rides this month, followed by Lyft, with taxis having significantly fewer rides. These are the only major transportation providers, so if Lyft doesn\u2019t give the most rides, then if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. Moreover, Uber likely will give the most rides and hence Lyft likely won\u2019t give the most rides. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Uber doesn\u2019t give the most rides, taxis will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We're given that there are three main transportation options: Uber, Lyft, and taxis.\n\n2. The ridership data suggests the following order of popularity:\n   Uber > Lyft > Taxis (with taxis having significantly fewer rides)\n\n3. We're told that if Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides. This can be represented logically as:\n   (Not Lyft Most) \u2192 (Not Uber Most \u2192 Taxis Most)\n\n4. We're also told that Uber likely will give the most rides, and consequently, Lyft likely won't give the most rides.\n\n5. The question asks if it follows that it's likely that, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will.\n\n6. Let's consider the possibilities:\n   - If Uber gives the most rides (which is likely), the condition \"if Uber doesn't give the most rides\" is not met, so the statement is vacuously true.\n   - If Uber doesn't give the most rides (which is unlikely), then according to the given information, since Lyft likely won't give the most rides either, taxis must give the most rides.\n\n7. The key here is that the statement \"if Lyft doesn't give the most rides, then if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides\" is given as a certainty, not a probability.\n\n8. Since Lyft likely won't give the most rides, and this statement is certain, it follows that if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will give the most rides.\n\n9. The unlikelihood of Uber not giving the most rides doesn't affect the logical conclusion; it only affects how often this scenario might occur.\n\nTherefore, it does follow that it's likely that, if Uber doesn't give the most rides, taxis will.\n\nAnswer: yes"
