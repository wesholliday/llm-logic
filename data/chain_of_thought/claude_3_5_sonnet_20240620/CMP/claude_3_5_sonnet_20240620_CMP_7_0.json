    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have three renewable energy sources: tidal, solar, and wind power.\n\n2. The forecasts suggest the following likely order of electricity generation:\n   Tidal > Solar > Wind\n\n3. We're told that these are the only major sources, which means one of them must generate the most electricity.\n\n4. We're given a conditional statement: If solar doesn't generate the most, then if tidal doesn't, wind will. This is logically correct based on the information given.\n\n5. We're also told that tidal power is likely to generate the most electricity, which implies solar power likely won't generate the most.\n\n6. The question asks: Is it likely that, if tidal doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?\n\n7. To answer this, we need to consider the scenario where tidal doesn't generate the most:\n   - If tidal doesn't generate the most, either solar or wind must.\n   - We know it's unlikely that solar will generate the most.\n   - Therefore, in the scenario where tidal doesn't generate the most, it becomes more likely that wind will.\n\n8. This aligns with the conditional statement given in point 4.\n\n9. While we can't say with absolute certainty, based on the information provided, it does seem likely that if tidal doesn't generate the most, wind will.\n\nAnswer: yes"
