    "user_prompt": "Suppose that the flu, common cold, and strep throat are the most prevalent illnesses this season. Doctors expect the flu likely will infect the most patients, followed by the common cold, with strep infections lagging behind. These are the only major illnesses spreading, so if colds don\u2019t infect the most people, then if flu doesn\u2019t, strep will. Moreover, flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if flu doesn\u2019t infect the most, strep will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We have three illnesses: flu, common cold, and strep throat.\n\n2. The expected order of prevalence is: flu > common cold > strep throat.\n\n3. We're told that these are the only major illnesses spreading.\n\n4. We're given two key pieces of information:\n   a) If colds don't infect the most people, then if flu doesn't, strep will.\n   b) Flu likely will infect the most and hence colds likely won't.\n\n5. From (b), we can infer that it's likely that flu will infect the most people.\n\n6. However, the question asks about a scenario where flu doesn't infect the most people.\n\n7. In this scenario (flu not infecting the most), we know from (a) that if colds also don't infect the most, then strep will.\n\n8. We also know from (b) that colds likely won't infect the most people.\n\n9. Combining these pieces of information, we can conclude that in the scenario where flu doesn't infect the most people, it's likely that colds won't either (from point 8).\n\n10. Therefore, based on the given information in (a), if flu doesn't infect the most and colds likely won't either, then strep will likely infect the most.\n\nThis logical chain leads us to conclude that it does follow that it's likely that, if flu doesn't infect the most, strep will.\n\nAnswer: yes"
