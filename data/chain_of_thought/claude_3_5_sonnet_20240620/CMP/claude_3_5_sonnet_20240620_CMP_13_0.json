    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. We're given that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth, in that order.\n\n2. We're told that if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will. This is a conditional statement.\n\n3. We're also told that Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, and as a result, Georgia likely won't.\n\n4. The question asks if it's likely that, if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\n5. To answer this, we need to consider what happens if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs:\n   - If Tennessee doesn't add the most, then either Georgia or Missouri will.\n   - We know from the given information that if Georgia doesn't add the most (which is likely), then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will.\n   - Since we're considering the case where Tennessee doesn't add the most, and we know Georgia likely won't, it follows that Missouri will.\n\n6. The key here is that the original statement \"if Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn't, Missouri will\" combined with the information that Georgia likely won't add the most jobs, leads to the conclusion that if Tennessee doesn't add the most, Missouri will.\n\n7. The word \"likely\" in the question matches the likelihood established in the premises, so we can maintain this level of certainty in our conclusion.\n\nTherefore, it does follow that it's likely that, if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, Missouri will.\n\nAnswer: yes"
