            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The package must have been delivered today and signed for.\"\n\n2. This statement contains two parts connected by \"and\":\n   a) The package must have been delivered today\n   b) The package must have been signed for\n\n3. In logic, when two statements are connected by \"and,\" both statements must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n4. If the original statement is true, then both parts (a) and (b) must be true individually.\n\n5. The question asks if we can infer \"The package must have been signed for\" from the original statement.\n\n6. This is exactly the second part (b) of the original statement.\n\n7. Since the original statement claims both parts are true, we can indeed infer that the package must have been signed for.\n\n8. The inference doesn't require any additional information or assumptions; it's directly stated in the original sentence.\n\nTherefore, based on this reasoning, we can confidently infer \"The package must have been signed for\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
