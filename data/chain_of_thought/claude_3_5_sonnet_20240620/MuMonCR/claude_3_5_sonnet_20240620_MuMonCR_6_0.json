            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The concert must have been sold out and started at 8 PM.\"\n\n2. This statement is a compound sentence consisting of two parts connected by \"and\":\n   a) The concert must have been sold out\n   b) The concert must have started at 8 PM\n\n3. In logic, when we have a compound statement using \"and,\" we can infer each individual part of the statement separately. This is known as the \"conjunction elimination\" rule.\n\n4. The second part of the original statement, \"The concert must have started at 8 PM,\" is exactly the same as the statement we're trying to infer.\n\n5. Since this part is directly stated in the original sentence, we can confidently infer it without any loss of information or change in meaning.\n\n6. The fact that the concert was also sold out doesn't affect or change the information about the starting time.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"The concert must have started at 8 PM\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
