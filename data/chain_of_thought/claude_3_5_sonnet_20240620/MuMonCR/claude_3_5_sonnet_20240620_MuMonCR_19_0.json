            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement has two main components:\n   a) The application must have been completed online\n   b) The application must have included references\n\n2. These two components are connected by the word \"and,\" which means both conditions must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer that \"The application must have included references\" from the original statement.\n\n4. To infer means to derive a conclusion based on the given information.\n\n5. In this case, the second part of the original statement directly states that the application must have included references.\n\n6. Even though the original statement also includes the requirement for online completion, this doesn't negate or change the requirement for references.\n\n7. Therefore, we can confidently infer that the application must have included references, as it is explicitly stated in the original sentence.\n\nAnswer: yes"
