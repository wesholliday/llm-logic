            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The document must have been signed and notarized.\"\n\n2. This statement uses the conjunction \"and,\" which means both conditions must be true:\n   a) The document must have been signed\n   b) The document must have been notarized\n\n3. For a compound statement using \"and\" to be true, both of its components must be true.\n\n4. If the original statement is true, then it necessarily follows that \"The document must have been notarized\" is also true.\n\n5. The question is asking if we can infer the second part of the statement from the whole statement.\n\n6. Since the original statement requires both signing and notarization, we can indeed infer that notarization must have occurred.\n\n7. Inferring one part of an \"and\" statement from the whole statement is a valid logical deduction.\n\nTherefore, we can confidently infer \"The document must have been notarized\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
