            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\"\n   b) \"The book was written by James\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the book was written by James\"\n   B = \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n3. The second statement directly affirms A, stating that \"The book was written by James\"\n\n4. In logic, this structure is known as Modus Ponens, which is a valid form of argument. It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have the conditional \"If A, then B\"\n   - We know that A is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that B is true\n\n6. Translating this back to our original statements:\n   - We have \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\"\n   - We know that \"The book was written by James\"\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that \"The book is a mystery novel\"\n\nGiven this logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The book is a mystery novel\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
