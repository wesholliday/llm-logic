The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"Ben ate pasta\"\n   Q = \"Kate ate the salad\"\n\n3. This type of logical structure is called \"modus ponens\" or \"affirming the antecedent\". It follows the form:\n   If P, then Q\n   P is true\n   Therefore, Q is true\n\n4. In our case:\n   If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad (If P, then Q)\n   Ben ate pasta (P is true)\n\n5. Since we know that the conditional statement is true (step 1a) and we know that the antecedent (Ben ate pasta) is true (step 1b), we can logically conclude that the consequent (Kate ate the salad) must also be true.\n\n6. This is a valid logical inference based on the rules of propositional logic.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"Kate ate the salad\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
