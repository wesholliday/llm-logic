            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\"\n   b) \"Joe went to the park\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"Joe went to the park\"\n   B = \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\n3. The second statement confirms that A is true: Joe did indeed go to the park.\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Ponens, which states:\n   If we have \"If A, then B\" and we know A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" (If A, then B)\n   - We know \"Joe went to the park\" (A is true)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"Lucy went to the zoo\" (B is true)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw the conclusion about Lucy going to the zoo based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
