            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\"\n   b) \"The shirt was cotton\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the shirt was cotton\"\n   B = \"the pants were denim\"\n\n3. The second statement directly affirms that A is true: \"The shirt was cotton\"\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B must also be true. This logical rule is called Modus Ponens.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\" (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim)\n   - We know that A is true (The shirt was cotton)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that B is true (The pants were denim)\n\n6. This inference is logically valid and allows us to draw a definite conclusion about the pants being denim.\n\nAnswer: yes"
