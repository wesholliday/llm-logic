            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\"\n   b) \"The doll was plastic\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the doll was plastic\"\n   B = \"the truck was metal\"\n\n3. The second statement directly affirms that A is true: \"The doll was plastic\"\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Ponens, which states:\n   If we have \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is true.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (If A, then B)\n   - We know \"The doll was plastic\" (A is true)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"The truck was metal\" (B is true)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
