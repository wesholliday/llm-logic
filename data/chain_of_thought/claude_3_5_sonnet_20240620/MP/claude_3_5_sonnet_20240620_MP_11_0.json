            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\"\n   b) \"The cake was chocolate\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the cake was chocolate\"\n   B = \"the muffins were blueberry\"\n\n3. The second statement directly affirms that A is true: \"The cake was chocolate\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario follows a rule called Modus Ponens, which states:\n   If we have \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   We have \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" (If A, then B)\n   We know \"The cake was chocolate\" (A is true)\n   Therefore, we can conclude \"The muffins were blueberry\" (B is true)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw the conclusion with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
