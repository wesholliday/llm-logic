            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Mary was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   B = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n3. The second statement directly affirms that A is true: Mary was indeed at the wedding.\n\n4. In logic, there is a rule called Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have the conditional: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   - We know that the antecedent (Mary was at the wedding) is true.\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that the consequent (Sue was at the wedding) must also be true.\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw a definite conclusion about Sue's presence at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
