            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n   b) Sam took a plane.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"Sam took a plane\"\n   Q = \"Erin took a train\"\n\n3. The second statement confirms that P is true: Sam did indeed take a plane.\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Ponens, which states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can conclude that Q is also true.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have the conditional: If Sam took a plane (P), then Erin took a train (Q)\n   - We know that Sam took a plane (P is true)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that Erin took a train (Q is true)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
