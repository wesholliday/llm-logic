The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"Sue chose pizza\"\n   B = \"Bob chose pasta\"\n\n3. This type of logical structure is called \"modus ponens\" or \"affirming the antecedent\". It follows the form:\n   If A, then B\n   A is true\n   Therefore, B is true\n\n4. In our case:\n   If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta (given)\n   Sue chose pizza (given)\n   Therefore, Bob chose pasta (conclusion)\n\n5. The second given statement confirms that the antecedent (Sue chose pizza) is indeed true.\n\n6. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is true, and we know the conditional statement is true, we can logically conclude that the consequent must also be true.\n\n7. Therefore, based on the given information and the rules of logical inference, we can indeed conclude that \"Bob chose pasta\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
