            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\"\n   b) \"The apple was red\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the apple was red\"\n   B = \"the banana was yellow\"\n\n3. The second statement confirms that A is true: \"The apple was red\"\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Ponens, which states:\n   If we have \"If A, then B\" and we know A is true, we can conclude B is true.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   We have \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" (If A, then B)\n   We know \"The apple was red\" (A is true)\n   Therefore, we can conclude \"The banana was yellow\" (B is true)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
