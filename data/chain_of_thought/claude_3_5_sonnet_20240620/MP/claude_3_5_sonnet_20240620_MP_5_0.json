            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\"\n   b) \"Jeff played basketball\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"Jeff played basketball\"\n   Q = \"Amy played tennis\"\n\n3. This conditional statement tells us that whenever P is true, Q must also be true.\n\n4. The second statement directly affirms that P is true: \"Jeff played basketball\"\n\n5. Since we know that P is true, and we have a conditional statement saying that if P is true then Q must be true, we can logically conclude that Q is also true.\n\n6. This form of logical reasoning is called Modus Ponens, which states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and we know P is true, we can conclude Q is true.\n\n7. Therefore, given the conditional statement and the fact that its antecedent (P) is true, we can indeed infer that its consequent (Q) is also true.\n\n8. In this case, we can infer that \"Amy played tennis\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
