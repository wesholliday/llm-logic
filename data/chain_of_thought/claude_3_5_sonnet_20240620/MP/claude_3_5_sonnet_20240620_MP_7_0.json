            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n   b) Alex finished the race.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"Alex finished the race\"\n   B = \"Chris finished the race\"\n\n3. The second statement confirms that A is true: Alex did indeed finish the race.\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Ponens, which states:\n   If we have \"If A, then B\" and we know A is true, we can conclude that B is also true.\n\n5. Applying Modus Ponens to our situation:\n   - We have \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" (If A, then B)\n   - We know \"Alex finished the race\" (A is true)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"Chris finished the race\" (B is true)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw the conclusion about Chris based on the given information about Alex.\n\nAnswer: yes"
