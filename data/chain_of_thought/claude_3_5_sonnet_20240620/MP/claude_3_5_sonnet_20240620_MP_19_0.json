            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\"\n   b) \"Tom watched football\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"Tom watched football\"\n   B = \"Jen watched basketball\"\n\n3. This conditional statement tells us that whenever A is true, B must also be true.\n\n4. The second statement directly affirms that A is true: \"Tom watched football\"\n\n5. Since we know that A is true, and we have a conditional statement saying that if A is true then B must be true, we can logically conclude that B must also be true.\n\n6. This form of logical inference is called \"Modus Ponens\" or \"affirming the antecedent.\"\n\n7. Therefore, given these two statements, we can indeed infer that \"Jen watched basketball.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
