            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n   b) \"The car was red\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the car was red\"\n   B = \"the truck was blue\"\n\n3. This type of logical structure is called \"modus ponens\" or \"affirming the antecedent\". It follows the form:\n   If A, then B\n   A is true\n   Therefore, B is true\n\n4. In our case:\n   If the car was red (A), then the truck was blue (B)\n   The car was red (A is true)\n\n5. Since we know that the conditional statement is true (step 1a) and we know that the antecedent (A) is true (step 1b), we can logically conclude that the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The truck was blue\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
