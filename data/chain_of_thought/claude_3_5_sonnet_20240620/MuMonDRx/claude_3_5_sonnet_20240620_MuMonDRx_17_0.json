            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The snorkel must be zump.\"\n2. This is a definitive statement, indicating that the snorkel has only one possible state: zump.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The snorkel must be blimple or zump.\"\n4. This new statement introduces an additional possibility: blimple.\n5. In logic, if A is true, then \"A or B\" is also true, regardless of whether B is true or false. This is known as the law of disjunction introduction.\n6. Since we know for certain that the snorkel is zump, it follows that the snorkel is either zump or anything else (including blimple).\n7. Therefore, while the original statement is more specific, the proposed inference is still logically valid and can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
