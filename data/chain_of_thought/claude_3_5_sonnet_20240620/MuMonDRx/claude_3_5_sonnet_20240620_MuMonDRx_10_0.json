            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The grazzle must be wumble.\"\n2. This is a definitive statement, indicating that the grazzle has only one possibility: it must be wumble.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The grazzle must be frazzle or wumble.\"\n4. This new statement introduces an additional possibility: frazzle.\n5. In logic, when we have a statement \"A must be B,\" it is always true that \"A must be B or C\" (where C is any other possibility).\n6. This is because if A must be B, it satisfies the condition of being \"B or C\" regardless of what C is.\n7. Even though we know the grazzle must be wumble, the statement \"must be frazzle or wumble\" is still logically true because it includes the correct option (wumble).\n8. The addition of \"frazzle\" as an option doesn't negate the truth of the original statement; it just adds an unnecessary alternative.\n\nTherefore, while the inference adds an unnecessary option, it is still logically valid and can be inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
