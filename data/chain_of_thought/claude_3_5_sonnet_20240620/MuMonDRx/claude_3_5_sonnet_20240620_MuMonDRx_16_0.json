This is a definitive statement about what the plonk must be.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The plonk must be quimble flonk or flimble zibber.\"\n4. This new statement introduces an additional possibility: \"quimble flonk.\"\n5. The original statement does not mention or imply anything about \"quimble flonk.\"\n6. By adding this new option, the inference actually weakens the original statement.\n7. The original statement is more specific and restrictive than the proposed inference.\n8. If we accept the inference, we would be allowing for a possibility (quimble flonk) that was not present in the original statement.\n9. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: no"
