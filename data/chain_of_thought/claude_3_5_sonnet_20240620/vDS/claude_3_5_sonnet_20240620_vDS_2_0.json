            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: Either A or B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Therefore, A\n\n2. This form of argument is known as disjunctive syllogism or process of elimination.\n\n3. Let's consider the logic:\n   - The first premise establishes that one of two options must be true: the book is either on the shelf or on the table.\n   - The second premise eliminates one of these options: the book is not on the table.\n   - Given that there are only two possible locations (as stated in the first premise), and one has been eliminated, the only remaining possibility must be true.\n\n4. This reasoning is deductively valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true. There's no way for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n5. We can also verify this using a truth table or by considering all possible scenarios, and we would find that in every case where the premises are true, the conclusion is also true.\n\n6. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on whether the premises are actually true in reality, but rather on whether the conclusion follows necessarily if we assume the premises are true.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
