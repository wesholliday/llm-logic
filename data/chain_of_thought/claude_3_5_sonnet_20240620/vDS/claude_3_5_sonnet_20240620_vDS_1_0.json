            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze this argument step by step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden\n   Premise 2: Fido is not in the garden\n   Conclusion: Fido is inside\n\n2. This argument follows a logical form known as disjunctive syllogism. The general form is:\n   P or Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, P\n\n3. In this case:\n   P = \"Fido is inside\"\n   Q = \"Fido is in the garden\"\n\n4. The first premise establishes that one of two possibilities must be true: either Fido is inside or in the garden. This is an exclusive \"or\" statement, meaning only one of these can be true at a time.\n\n5. The second premise eliminates one of these possibilities by stating that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n6. Given that there are only two possible locations for Fido (as stated in the first premise), and one of those locations has been ruled out (by the second premise), the only remaining possibility is that Fido is inside.\n\n7. This form of reasoning is logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true. There is no way for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n8. The validity of this argument form does not depend on whether the premises are actually true in reality, but rather on the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
