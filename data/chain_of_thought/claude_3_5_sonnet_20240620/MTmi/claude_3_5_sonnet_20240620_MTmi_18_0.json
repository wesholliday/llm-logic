            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n   b) The truck might not have been metal.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement: If A, then B.\n   A: The doll was plastic\n   B: The truck must have been metal\n\n3. The second statement introduces uncertainty about B. It suggests that B might not be true.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens.\n\n5. However, in this case, we don't know for certain that B is false. The second statement only says that B might not be true.\n\n6. When there's uncertainty about B, we cannot definitively conclude anything about A.\n\n7. Therefore, from these statements alone, we cannot infer with certainty that \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\n8. We can only say that if the truck indeed turns out not to be metal, then the doll would not be plastic. But based on the given information, this remains uncertain.\n\nAnswer: no"
