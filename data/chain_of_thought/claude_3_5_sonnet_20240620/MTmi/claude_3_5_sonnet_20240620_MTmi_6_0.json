            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta\"\n   b) \"Bob might not have chosen pasta\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement. It means that whenever Sue chooses pizza, Bob must choose pasta. In logical terms, we can write this as: Sue choosing pizza \u2192 Bob choosing pasta\n\n3. The second statement tells us that there's a possibility that Bob did not choose pasta. This doesn't mean he definitely didn't choose pasta, just that it's not certain that he did.\n\n4. Now, let's consider what would happen if Sue had chosen pizza:\n   - If Sue chose pizza, then according to the first statement, Bob must have chosen pasta.\n   - But the second statement tells us that Bob might not have chosen pasta.\n   - These two situations are contradictory.\n\n5. The only way to resolve this contradiction is if Sue did not choose pizza. Because if she had, it would force Bob to choose pasta (according to the first statement), which contradicts the second statement.\n\n6. This type of reasoning is called \"modus tollens\" in logic. It states that if P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\n7. In this case:\n   P: Sue chose pizza\n   Q: Bob chose pasta\n   We know that P implies Q, and we're told that Q might be false. Therefore, P must be false.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
