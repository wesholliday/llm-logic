            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement: If A, then B.\n   A: Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B: Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement introduces uncertainty about B. It suggests that there's a possibility that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n4. In logic, if we have \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens.\n\n5. However, in this case, we don't know for certain that B is false. We only know that B might be false.\n\n6. The phrase \"might not have\" indicates possibility, not certainty. It doesn't definitively state that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, only that there's a chance he didn't.\n\n7. Because of this uncertainty, we cannot conclusively state that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If we knew for sure that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, then we could make that conclusion.\n\n8. The information we have allows for the possibility that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, but it doesn't prove it with certainty.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot definitively infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. We can only say that it's possible she didn't.\n\nAnswer: no"
