            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n   b) Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement. It's a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   - A: Mary was at the wedding\n   - B: Sue must have been at the wedding\n\n3. The second statement tells us that Sue might not have been at the wedding. This means there's a possibility that Sue wasn't there.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the logical implications:\n   - If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there (from statement 1).\n   - But we know Sue might not have been there (from statement 2).\n   - These two statements can only be reconciled if Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n5. Here's why:\n   - If Mary was at the wedding, it would necessitate Sue's presence (statement 1).\n   - But we can't be certain of Sue's presence (statement 2).\n   - Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, Mary must not have been at the wedding.\n\n6. This is an example of modus tollens, a form of logical argument:\n   - If P, then Q.\n   - Not Q.\n   - Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\n   - If Mary was there (P), then Sue must have been there (Q).\n   - Sue might not have been there (not Q).\n   - Therefore, Mary was not there (not P).\n\nAnswer: yes"
