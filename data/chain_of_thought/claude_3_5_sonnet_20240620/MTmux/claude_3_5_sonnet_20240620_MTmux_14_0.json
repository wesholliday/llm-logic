            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged.\n   b) It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The clug was fleeked\n   B: The clug must have been snugged\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B:\n   Not B: It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, Not P\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If A \u2192 B (If the clug was fleeked, then the clug must have been snugged)\n   Not B (It's not the case that the clug must have been snugged)\n   Therefore, Not A (The clug was not fleeked)\n\n6. The conclusion \"The clug was not fleeked\" logically follows from the given statements using Modus Tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes"
