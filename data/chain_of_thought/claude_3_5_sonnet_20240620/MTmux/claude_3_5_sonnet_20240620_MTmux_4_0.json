            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked.\n   b) It's not the case that the fribble must have crinked.\n\n2. Let's represent these statements symbolically:\n   Let S = \"the fribble was snurgled\"\n   Let C = \"the fribble must have crinked\"\n   \n   Then our statements are:\n   a) S \u2192 C (If S, then C)\n   b) \u00acC (not C)\n\n3. We want to know if we can conclude \u00acS (not S) from these statements.\n\n4. This logical structure is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP\n\n5. In our case:\n   S \u2192 C (given)\n   \u00acC (given)\n   Therefore, \u00acS (conclusion)\n\n6. This means that if it's true that snurgling implies crinking, and we know that crinking didn't happen, then snurgling couldn't have happened either.\n\n7. The logic is valid and the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The fribble was not snurgled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
