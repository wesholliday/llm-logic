            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened.\n   b) It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The dreb was vroombed\n   B: The dreb must have been spened\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B:\n   Not B: It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as modus tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, Not P\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If A \u2192 B (If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened)\n   Not B (It's not the case that the dreb must have been spened)\n   Therefore, Not A (The dreb was not vroombed)\n\n6. The conclusion \"The dreb was not vroombed\" logically follows from the given statements using modus tollens.\n\nAnswer: yes"
