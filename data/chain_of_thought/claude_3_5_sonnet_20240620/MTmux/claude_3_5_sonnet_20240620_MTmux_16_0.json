            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n   b) It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The sneg was crampled\n   B: The sneg must have sproted the frink\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B:\n   Not B: It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as modus tollens, which follows the structure:\n   If A, then B\n   Not B\n   Therefore, Not A\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If the sneg was crampled (A), then the sneg must have sproted the frink (B)\n   It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink (Not B)\n   Therefore, the sneg was not crampled (Not A)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. When we know that a conditional statement is true (If A, then B) and we also know that the consequent (B) is false, we can conclude that the antecedent (A) must also be false.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The sneg was not crampled\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
