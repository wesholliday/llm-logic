            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n   b) It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The grommet was sploffed\n   B: The grommet must have plopped the frink\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B:\n   Not B: It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as modus tollens (denying the consequent). The structure is:\n   If A, then B\n   Not B\n   Therefore, Not A\n\n5. Applying this to our specific case:\n   If the grommet was sploffed (A), then the grommet must have plopped the frink (B)\n   It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink (Not B)\n   Therefore, the grommet was not sploffed (Not A)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. If the consequent (B) is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false for the conditional statement to hold true.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
