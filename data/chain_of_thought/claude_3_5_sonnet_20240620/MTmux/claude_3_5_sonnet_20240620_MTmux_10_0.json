            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n   b) It's not the case that the wug must have been garpled.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement: If A, then B.\n   Where A = \"the wug was sproinged\" and B = \"it must have been garpled\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: Not B.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If A \u2192 B and \u00acB, then \u00acA\n\n6. We have A \u2192 B (from statement 1) and \u00acB (from statement 2)\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically conclude \u00acA, which means \"The wug was not sproinged\"\n\n8. This conclusion directly answers the question we were asked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
