            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled.\n   b) It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The sprocket was cranked\n   B: The sprocket must have been daggled\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B:\n   Not B: It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). The general form is:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, Not P\n\n5. Applying this to our specific case:\n   If A, then B\n   Not B\n   Therefore, Not A\n\n6. Translating this back to our original statements:\n   If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\n   It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\n   Therefore, the sprocket was not cranked\n\n7. This logical inference is valid. When we know that a conditional statement is true, and we also know that its consequent (the \"then\" part) is false, we can conclude that its antecedent (the \"if\" part) must also be false.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
