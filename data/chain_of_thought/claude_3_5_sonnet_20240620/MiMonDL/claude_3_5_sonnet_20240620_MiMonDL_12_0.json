            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The food might be spicy.\"\n2. This statement expresses a possibility, not a certainty. The word \"might\" indicates that there's a chance the food is spicy, but it's not guaranteed.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The food might be spicy or mild.\"\n4. This new statement also expresses a possibility, but it includes an additional option: the food might be mild.\n5. In logic, when we have a statement \"A or B,\" it is true if either A is true, B is true, or both are true.\n6. The original statement allows for the possibility of the food being spicy, which is included in the new statement.\n7. The new statement adds the possibility of the food being mild, which doesn't contradict the original statement. The original statement doesn't rule out the possibility of the food being mild; it simply doesn't mention it.\n8. Therefore, the new statement is a logical extension of the original statement. It includes all the possibilities from the original statement (food might be spicy) and adds another possibility (food might be mild) without contradicting the original.\n9. In formal logic, this is an example of the \"weakening\" or \"addition\" rule, where we can always add additional possibilities to a statement without making it false.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
