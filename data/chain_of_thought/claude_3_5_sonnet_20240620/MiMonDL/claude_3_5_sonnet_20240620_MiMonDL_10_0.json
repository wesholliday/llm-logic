            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The computer might be broken.\"\n\n2. The statement we're trying to infer is \"The computer might be broken or working.\"\n\n3. In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B, because if A is true, then \"A or B\" is always true regardless of whether B is true or false. This is known as the law of disjunction introduction.\n\n4. In this case, \"The computer might be broken\" is our A, and \"The computer might be working\" is our B.\n\n5. The word \"might\" in both statements indicates uncertainty, which doesn't affect the logical relationship between the statements.\n\n6. By adding \"or working\" to the original statement, we're not changing the meaning or strength of the original claim. We're simply adding another possibility.\n\n7. The new statement is actually less specific (or more general) than the original, as it allows for both possibilities - the computer being broken or working.\n\n8. Since the original statement is included within the broader statement, and we haven't contradicted or altered the original meaning, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
