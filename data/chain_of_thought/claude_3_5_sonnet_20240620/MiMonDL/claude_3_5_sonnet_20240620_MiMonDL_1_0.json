            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The envelope might be under a bed.\"\n\n2. This statement expresses a possibility about the location of the envelope.\n\n3. The proposed inference is \"The envelope might be under a bed or upstairs.\"\n\n4. This new statement is a disjunction (an \"or\" statement) that includes the original possibility plus an additional one.\n\n5. In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B, because if A is true, then \"A or B\" must also be true, regardless of whether B is true or false. This is known as the rule of disjunction introduction.\n\n6. In this case, \"under a bed\" is our original A, and \"upstairs\" is the additional B.\n\n7. Even if we don't know anything about whether the envelope might be upstairs, the disjunction \"under a bed or upstairs\" must be at least as likely as \"under a bed\" alone.\n\n8. Therefore, if it's possible that the envelope is under a bed, it's also possible that it's either under a bed or upstairs.\n\n9. The word \"might\" in both statements preserves the element of possibility, so the logic holds.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
