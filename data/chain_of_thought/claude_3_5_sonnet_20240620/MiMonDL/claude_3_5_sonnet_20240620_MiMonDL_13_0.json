            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The meeting might be cancelled.\"\n2. The proposed inference is \"The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled.\"\n3. The key difference is the addition of \"or rescheduled\" in the inference.\n4. In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B, because if A is true, then \"A or B\" is automatically true regardless of whether B is true or false. This is known as the rule of disjunction introduction.\n5. In this case, \"The meeting might be cancelled\" is our A, and \"The meeting might be rescheduled\" is our B.\n6. Even if we don't know anything about whether the meeting might be rescheduled, we can still logically infer \"The meeting might be cancelled or rescheduled\" from \"The meeting might be cancelled.\"\n7. The word \"might\" in both statements preserves the uncertainty, so we're not introducing any additional claims of certainty.\n8. Therefore, the inference is logically valid and does not introduce any information that wasn't at least implicitly present in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
