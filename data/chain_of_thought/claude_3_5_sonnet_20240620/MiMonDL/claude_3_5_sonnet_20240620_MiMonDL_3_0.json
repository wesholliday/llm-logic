            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The keys might be in the drawer.\"\n2. This statement expresses a possibility, not a certainty.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The keys might be in the drawer or on the table.\"\n4. This new statement also expresses a possibility, and it includes the original possibility (in the drawer) plus an additional one (on the table).\n5. In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B, because if A is true, then \"A or B\" is automatically true regardless of whether B is true or false. This is known as the rule of disjunction introduction.\n6. In this case, \"The keys might be in the drawer\" is our A, and \"The keys might be on the table\" is our B.\n7. By adding \"or on the table,\" we're not changing the truth value of the original statement; we're just expanding the range of possibilities.\n8. The new statement is less specific than the original, but it still includes all the information from the original statement.\n9. Therefore, the inference is logically valid. We can infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
