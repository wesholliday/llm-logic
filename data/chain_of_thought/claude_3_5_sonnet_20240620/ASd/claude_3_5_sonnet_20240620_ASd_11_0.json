            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\"\n   This is a simple conditional statement.\n\n2. The proposed inference adds an additional condition: \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\"\n\n3. The original statement only considers sleep as a factor in preventing tiredness. It doesn't account for other factors that might cause tiredness.\n\n4. Hard labor is a significant factor that can cause tiredness, regardless of how much sleep one gets.\n\n5. The original statement doesn't claim that sleep is the only factor affecting tiredness; it merely states that sufficient sleep prevents tiredness under normal circumstances.\n\n6. By adding \"and do hard labor,\" we're introducing a new variable that wasn't considered in the original statement. This new variable (hard labor) can independently cause tiredness.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the second statement is true based solely on the information given in the first statement.\n\n8. The second statement is actually a stronger claim than the first, as it suggests that sleep can prevent tiredness even in the presence of hard labor, which is not supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
