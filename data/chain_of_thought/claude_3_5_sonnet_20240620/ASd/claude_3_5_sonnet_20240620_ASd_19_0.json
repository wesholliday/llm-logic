            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If you fill up the gas tank, the car will run.\"\n   This is a simple conditional statement: A \u2192 B, where A is \"filling up the gas tank\" and B is \"the car will run.\"\n\n2. The proposed inference adds an additional condition: \"If you fill up the gas tank and there is a hole in it, the car will run.\"\n   This can be represented as: (A \u2227 C) \u2192 B, where C is \"there is a hole in the gas tank.\"\n\n3. In logic, we cannot automatically assume that adding an additional condition to the antecedent (the \"if\" part) will preserve the truth of the consequent (the \"then\" part).\n\n4. In fact, adding the condition of a hole in the gas tank directly contradicts the implicit assumption in the original statement that the gas tank is functional.\n\n5. A hole in the gas tank would likely cause the fuel to leak out, preventing the car from running or at least significantly reducing its ability to run.\n\n6. The original statement doesn't account for potential issues with the gas tank itself. It assumes normal, functional conditions.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first. The addition of the hole in the gas tank is a significant change that alters the expected outcome.\n\nAnswer: no"
