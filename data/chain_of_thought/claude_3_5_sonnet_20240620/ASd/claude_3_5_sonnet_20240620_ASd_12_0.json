            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If I finish my homework, I can play video games.\"\n   This is a simple conditional statement.\n\n2. The proposed inference adds an additional condition: \"If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games.\"\n\n3. In logic, this is known as strengthening the antecedent (the \"if\" part of the statement).\n\n4. Generally, strengthening the antecedent does not preserve the truth of a conditional statement. Adding extra conditions can invalidate the original conclusion.\n\n5. In this specific case, if the computer catches on fire, it would likely prevent the ability to play video games, even if the homework is finished.\n\n6. The original statement doesn't account for or guarantee against other potential obstacles to playing video games (like a computer fire).\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first. The second statement is adding a condition that could potentially negate the conclusion, which wasn't present in the original premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
