            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\"\n   b) \"It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true: either Fido is in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n\n3. The second statement directly negates one of the options from the first statement. It tells us that Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\n\n4. In logic, when we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true. This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\n5. By negating \"Fido must be in the garden,\" we've eliminated that option from the original OR statement.\n\n6. Since one option has been eliminated and we know that at least one of the options must be true (from the original OR statement), we can logically conclude that the remaining option, \"Fido is inside,\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and applying the rules of logical deduction, we can indeed infer that \"Fido is inside.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
