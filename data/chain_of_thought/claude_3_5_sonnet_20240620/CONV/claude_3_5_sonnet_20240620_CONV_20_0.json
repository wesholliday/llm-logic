The original statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red.\"\n   This is the converse of the original statement, in the form \"If B, then A.\"\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. They are not logically equivalent.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   - The apple could be red, and the banana yellow (satisfies the original statement)\n   - The apple could be green, and the banana yellow (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   - The apple could be red, and the banana green (contradicts the original statement)\n\n5. The original statement only tells us what happens when the apple is red. It doesn't give us any information about what must be true when the banana is yellow.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement from the original statement. The banana being yellow doesn't necessarily mean the apple must be red.\n\nAnswer: no"
