The original statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane.\"\n   This is the converse of the original statement, in the form \"If Q, then P.\"\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. They are not logically equivalent.\n\n4. Let's consider an example:\n   - The original statement allows for the possibility that Erin took a train even if Sam didn't take a plane.\n   - It doesn't guarantee that Sam took a plane every time Erin took a train.\n\n5. We can illustrate this with a truth table:\n   - Sam took a plane (P), Erin took a train (Q)\n   - T T : Possible (satisfies both statements)\n   - T F : Impossible (contradicts original statement)\n   - F T : Possible (doesn't contradict original statement)\n   - F F : Possible (doesn't contradict original statement)\n\n6. As we can see, there are scenarios where Erin took a train (Q is true) but Sam didn't take a plane (P is false), which contradicts the converse statement.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
