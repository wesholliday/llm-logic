The original statement is: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the book is a mystery novel, then the book was written by James.\"\n   This would be the converse of the original statement, in the form \"If B, then A.\"\n\n3. In logic, we cannot automatically infer the converse of a conditional statement. The original statement only tells us what happens if James wrote the book, but it doesn't give us information about all mystery novels.\n\n4. Consider these possibilities:\n   - The statement allows for James to write only mystery novels.\n   - However, it doesn't exclude the possibility that other authors also write mystery novels.\n\n5. For example:\n   - If Sarah also writes mystery novels, then there could be mystery novels not written by James.\n   - This would make the proposed inference false.\n\n6. The original statement is compatible with James writing all mystery novels, but it doesn't necessitate it. We simply don't have enough information to make that conclusion.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
