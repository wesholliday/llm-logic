The original statement is: \"If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\"\n   This is the converse of the original statement, in the form \"If B, then A.\"\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. They are not logically equivalent.\n\n4. For example, consider this statement: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n   The converse would be: \"If the ground is wet, then it's raining.\"\n   We can see that the converse isn't always true, as the ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n5. Similarly, in our case, just because we know that the bear being in the case implies the wolf is in the den, we cannot automatically conclude that the wolf being in the den implies the bear is in the case.\n\n6. The wolf could potentially be in the den for reasons unrelated to the bear's location.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
