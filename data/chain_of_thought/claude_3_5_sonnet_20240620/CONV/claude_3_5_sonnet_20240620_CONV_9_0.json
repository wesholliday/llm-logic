The original statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\"\n   This is the converse of the original statement, in the form \"If B, then A.\"\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. They are not logically equivalent.\n\n4. Let's consider an example:\n   - The original statement allows for the possibility that Mark bought the blue shirt even if Lisa didn't buy the red shirt.\n   - It doesn't guarantee that Lisa bought the red shirt whenever Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n5. We can illustrate this with a truth table:\n   - Lisa bought red (A) | Mark bought blue (B) | If A, then B\n     True                | True                 | True\n     True                | False                | False\n     False               | True                 | True\n     False               | False                | True\n\n   Note that when A is false and B is true, the original statement is still true, but its converse would be false.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
