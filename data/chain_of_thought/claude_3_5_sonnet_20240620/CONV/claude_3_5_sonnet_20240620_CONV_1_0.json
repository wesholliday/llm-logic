            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n   This would be the converse of the original statement, in the form \"If B, then A.\"\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. They are not logically equivalent.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   a) Mary could be at the wedding, and Sue would definitely be there (according to the original statement).\n   b) Sue could be at the wedding without Mary being there. The original statement doesn't say anything about Sue's presence requiring Mary's presence.\n\n5. For example, it's possible that:\n   - Sue always attends weddings.\n   - Mary only attends some weddings, and when she does, Sue is always there too.\n\n6. In this scenario, the original statement would be true, but the converse would not always be true.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse from the original statement alone.\n\nAnswer: no"
