The original statement is: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Chris finished the race, then Alex finished the race.\"\n   This would be the converse of the original statement, in the form \"If B, then A.\"\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. They are not logically equivalent.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   - It's possible that Chris always finishes when Alex does (satisfying the original statement).\n   - However, Chris might also finish some races that Alex doesn't finish.\n\n5. For example:\n   - Race 1: Alex finishes, Chris finishes (satisfies the original statement)\n   - Race 2: Alex doesn't finish, Chris finishes (still satisfies the original statement)\n\n6. In the second case, the converse statement would be false because Chris finished but Alex didn't.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the converse from the original statement. The original statement does not provide enough information to guarantee that Alex finishes whenever Chris does.\n\nAnswer: no"
