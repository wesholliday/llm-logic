            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake\"\n   b) \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake\"\n\n2. Let's consider statement (a). This doesn't mean the mummy wasn't awake; it just means it's not necessarily true that the mummy was awake. The mummy could have been awake or not awake.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement (b). This is a conditional statement: if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n\n4. Combining these statements:\n   - If the vampire was awake, then (according to b) the mummy must have been awake.\n   - But we know from (a) that it's not necessarily true that the mummy was awake.\n\n5. These two points create a contradiction if we assume the vampire was awake:\n   - If the vampire was awake, the mummy must have been awake (from b)\n   - But it's not necessarily true that the mummy was awake (from a)\n\n6. The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the vampire was not awake.\n\n7. If the vampire was not awake, then the conditional statement (b) is not triggered, and there's no conflict with statement (a).\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: yes"
