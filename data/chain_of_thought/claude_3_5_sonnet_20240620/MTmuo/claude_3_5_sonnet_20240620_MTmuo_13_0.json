            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\"\n   b) \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\"\n\n2. Let's analyze the first statement:\n   - It doesn't say the truck wasn't blue, just that it's not necessarily blue.\n   - This means the truck could be blue or any other color.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the second statement:\n   - This is a conditional statement: if A (car was red), then B (truck must have been blue).\n\n4. Combining these statements:\n   - If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue (from statement b).\n   - But we know it's not the case that the truck must have been blue (from statement a).\n\n5. This creates a contradiction if we assume the car was red:\n   - If the car was red, it would force the truck to be blue.\n   - But we know the truck isn't necessarily blue.\n\n6. To resolve this contradiction:\n   - The assumption that led to it (the car being red) must be false.\n\n7. Therefore:\n   - We can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nThis is a form of logical reasoning called modus tollens: \nIf P, then Q. Not Q. Therefore, not P.\n\nIn this case:\nP: The car was red\nQ: The truck must have been blue\n\nWe know not Q, so we can conclude not P.\n\nAnswer: yes"
