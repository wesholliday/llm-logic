            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"\n   b) \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2. Let's consider statement (a). This means that it's possible Mark didn't buy the blue shirt. It doesn't say he definitely didn't buy it, just that it's not certain that he did.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement (b). This is a conditional statement: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n4. Combining these statements:\n   - We know it's not certain that Mark bought the blue shirt (from a)\n   - But if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (from b)\n\n5. These two statements can only be true simultaneously if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. Here's why:\n   - If Lisa had bought the red shirt, then according to (b), Mark must have bought the blue shirt\n   - But we know from (a) that it's not certain Mark bought the blue shirt\n   - The only way to resolve this contradiction is if Lisa did not buy the red shirt\n\n6. This is an example of modus tollens, a form of logical reasoning:\n   - If P, then Q\n   - Not Q\n   - Therefore, not P\n\n   In this case:\n   - If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (Q)\n   - It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt (Not Q)\n   - Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not P)\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
