            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the pants must have been denim\"\n   b) \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\"\n\n2. Let's consider statement (a). This means that it's possible the pants were not denim. In other words, the pants being denim is not a necessity.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement (b). This is a conditional statement: if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n\n4. If we assume that the shirt was cotton, then according to statement (b), the pants must have been denim.\n\n5. However, this contradicts statement (a), which says it's not necessarily true that the pants were denim.\n\n6. The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the antecedent of statement (b) is false. In other words, the shirt must not have been cotton.\n\n7. If the shirt had been cotton, it would force the pants to be denim (by statement b), which we know is not necessarily true (by statement a).\n\n8. Therefore, to maintain consistency between both statements, we must conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: yes"
