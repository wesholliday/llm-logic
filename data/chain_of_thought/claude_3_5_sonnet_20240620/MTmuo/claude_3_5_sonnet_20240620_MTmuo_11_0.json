            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\"\n   b) \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry\"\n\n2. Let's consider statement (a). This means that it's possible the muffins were not blueberry. In other words, the muffins being blueberry is not a necessity.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement (b). This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the cake was chocolate\"\n   B = \"the muffins must have been blueberry\"\n\n4. Combining the information from (a) and (b), we can see that:\n   - We know B is false (from statement a)\n   - We have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" (from statement b)\n\n5. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n6. Therefore, if B (the muffins must have been blueberry) is false, and we have \"If A, then B\", we can conclude that A (the cake was chocolate) must also be false.\n\n7. The negation of \"the cake was chocolate\" is \"the cake was not chocolate\".\n\nThus, we can indeed infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
