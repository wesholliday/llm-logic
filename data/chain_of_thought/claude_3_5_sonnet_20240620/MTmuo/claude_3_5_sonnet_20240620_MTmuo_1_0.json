            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n   b) \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n\n2. Let's consider statement (a). This means that Sue's presence at the wedding is not certain or necessary. It doesn't mean Sue wasn't there, just that her presence wasn't mandatory.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement (b). This is a conditional statement: If Mary was there, then Sue must have been there.\n\n4. Combining these statements:\n   - We know Sue's presence wasn't necessary (from a)\n   - But if Mary was there, Sue's presence would have been necessary (from b)\n\n5. These two statements can only be true simultaneously if Mary was not at the wedding. Here's why:\n   - If Mary was at the wedding, then according to (b), Sue must have been there.\n   - But we know from (a) that Sue's presence wasn't necessary.\n   - The only way to resolve this contradiction is if Mary wasn't at the wedding.\n\n6. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. If she had been, it would contradict our given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
