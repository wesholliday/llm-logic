            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the truck must have been metal\"\n   b) \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\"\n\n2. Let's consider statement (a). This means that it's possible the truck was not metal. In other words, the truck being metal is not a necessity.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement (b). This is a conditional statement: if the antecedent (the doll was plastic) is true, then the consequent (the truck must have been metal) must also be true.\n\n4. Combining these statements:\n   - If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal (from statement b)\n   - But we know it's not necessarily true that the truck was metal (from statement a)\n\n5. This creates a contradiction IF we assume the doll was plastic:\n   - If the doll was plastic, the truck must be metal\n   - But we know the truck isn't necessarily metal\n   - Therefore, the doll cannot have been plastic\n\n6. The only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that the doll was not plastic. If it were plastic, it would force the truck to be metal, which we know is not necessarily the case.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
