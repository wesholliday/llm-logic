            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n   b) Amy did not play tennis.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"Jeff played basketball\"\n   Q = \"Amy played tennis\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q: \"Amy did not play tennis\"\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   And \u00acQ (not Q)\n   Then \u00acP (not P)\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If Jeff played basketball \u2192 Amy played tennis\n   And Amy did not play tennis\n   Then Jeff did not play basketball\n\n6. The given information perfectly fits the Modus Tollens rule.\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
