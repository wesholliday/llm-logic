            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n   b) The mummy was not awake.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   B = \"the mummy was awake\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that B is false: \"The mummy was not awake.\"\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens or \"denying the consequent.\"\n\n5. To understand why this works, consider the possibilities:\n   - If A were true, then B would have to be true (according to the first statement).\n   - But we know B is false (from the second statement).\n   - Therefore, A cannot be true; it must be false.\n\n6. Applying this to our scenario:\n   - If the vampire was awake (A), then the mummy would be awake (B).\n   - We know the mummy is not awake (not B).\n   - Therefore, the vampire cannot be awake (not A).\n\n7. Thus, we can logically conclude that \"The vampire was not awake.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
