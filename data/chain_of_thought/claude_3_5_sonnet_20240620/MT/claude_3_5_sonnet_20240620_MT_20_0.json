            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n   b) The banana was not yellow.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"The apple was red\"\n   Q = \"The banana was yellow\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q: \"The banana was not yellow\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   And \u00acQ (Not Q)\n   Then \u00acP (Not P)\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If (The apple was red) \u2192 (The banana was yellow)\n   And (The banana was not yellow)\n   Then (The apple was not red)\n\n6. The logic behind this is:\n   - If the first statement is true, then whenever the apple is red, the banana must be yellow.\n   - We know for a fact that the banana is not yellow.\n   - Therefore, the apple cannot be red, because if it were, it would contradict our known fact about the banana.\n\n7. This form of reasoning is valid and allows us to make a definitive conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
