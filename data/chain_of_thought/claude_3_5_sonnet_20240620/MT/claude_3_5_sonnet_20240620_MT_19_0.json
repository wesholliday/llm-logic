            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n   b) Jen did not watch basketball.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"Tom watched football\"\n   Q = \"Jen watched basketball\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q: \"Jen did not watch basketball\"\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   And \u00acQ (not Q)\n   Then \u00acP (not P)\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If Tom watched football \u2192 Jen watched basketball\n   And Jen did not watch basketball\n   Then Tom did not watch football\n\n6. The given statements match the structure of Modus Tollens perfectly.\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: yes"
