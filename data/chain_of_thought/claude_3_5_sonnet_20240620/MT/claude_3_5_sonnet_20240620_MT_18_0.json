            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n   b) The truck was not metal.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"the doll was plastic\"\n   Q = \"the truck was metal\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q: \"The truck was not metal\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   Not Q (Q is false)\n   Therefore, Not P (P must be false)\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If (the doll was plastic) \u2192 (the truck was metal)\n   The truck was not metal\n   Therefore, the doll was not plastic\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. If the first statement is true (if the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal), and we know for certain that the truck was not metal, then it must be the case that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
