The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"Sue chose pizza\"\n   Q = \"Bob chose pasta\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q, which we can write as \"not Q\".\n\n4. In logic, there is a rule called Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q\", we can conclude \"not P\".\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - We have \"If P, then Q\" (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta)\n   - We have \"not Q\" (Bob did not choose pasta)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"not P\" (Sue did not choose pizza)\n\n6. This logical deduction is valid because if the initial conditional statement is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\n7. In everyday language: If it's true that Sue choosing pizza would mean Bob chose pasta, and we know Bob didn't choose pasta, then Sue couldn't have chosen pizza.\n\nAnswer: yes"
