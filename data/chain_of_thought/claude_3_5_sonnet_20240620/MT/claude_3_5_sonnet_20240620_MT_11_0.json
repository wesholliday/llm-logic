            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n   b) The muffins were not blueberry.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"the cake was chocolate\"\n   Q = \"the muffins were blueberry\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q: \"The muffins were not blueberry\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   Not Q (Q is false)\n   Therefore, Not P (P must be false)\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If (cake was chocolate) \u2192 (muffins were blueberry)\n   Muffins were not blueberry\n   Therefore, the cake was not chocolate\n\n6. This logical inference is valid because if the first statement is true, and the muffins are indeed not blueberry, then the cake cannot be chocolate. If it were chocolate, it would contradict the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that \"The cake was not chocolate\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
