            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n   b) Chris did not finish the race.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"Alex finished the race\"\n   B = \"Chris finished the race\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"Chris did not finish the race\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as modus tollens, which follows the structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If Alex finished (P), then Chris finished (Q)\n   Chris did not finish (Not Q)\n   Therefore, Alex did not finish (Not P)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid because if the conditional statement is true (If Alex finished, then Chris finished), and we know for certain that Chris did not finish, then it must be the case that Alex did not finish. If Alex had finished, it would contradict the conditional statement since Chris didn't finish.\n\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer that Alex did not finish the race from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
