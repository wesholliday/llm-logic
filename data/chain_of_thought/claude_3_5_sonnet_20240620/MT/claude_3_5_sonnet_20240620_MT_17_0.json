            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\n   b) Kate did not eat the salad.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"Ben ate pasta\"\n   Q = \"Kate ate the salad\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q: \"Kate did not eat the salad\"\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q\", we can conclude \"not P\"\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - We have \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad\" (If P, then Q)\n   - We also have \"Kate did not eat the salad\" (not Q)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"Ben did not eat pasta\" (not P)\n\n6. This conclusion is valid because if the conditional statement is true, and the consequent (Kate eating the salad) is false, then the antecedent (Ben eating pasta) must also be false. If Ben had eaten pasta, it would necessitate Kate eating the salad, but we know she didn't.\n\nAnswer: yes"
