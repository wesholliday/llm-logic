            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   b) The book is not a mystery novel.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the book was written by James\"\n   B = \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"The book is not a mystery novel\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   Not Q (Q is false)\n   Therefore, Not P (P must be false)\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If A \u2192 B (If the book was written by James, then it's a mystery novel)\n   Not B (The book is not a mystery novel)\n   Therefore, Not A (The book was not written by James)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid because if the first statement is true, and the book is indeed not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James. If it were written by James, it would have to be a mystery novel according to the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
