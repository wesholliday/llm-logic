            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n   b) Erin did not take a train.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"Sam took a plane\"\n   Q = \"Erin took a train\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q: \"Erin did not take a train\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   Not Q (Q is false)\n   Therefore, Not P (P must be false)\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If Sam took a plane \u2192 Erin took a train\n   Erin did not take a train (Not Q)\n   Therefore, Sam did not take a plane (Not P)\n\n6. The logic works as follows: If the conditional statement is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false. If it were true, Q would have to be true according to the conditional statement, but we know Q is false.\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: yes"
