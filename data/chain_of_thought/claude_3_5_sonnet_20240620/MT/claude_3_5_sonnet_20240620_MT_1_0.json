            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = Mary was at the wedding\n   B = Sue was at the wedding\n\n3. The second statement directly negates B (Sue was not at the wedding).\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as modus tollens, which follows the structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If Mary was at the wedding (P), then Sue was at the wedding (Q)\n   Sue was not at the wedding (Not Q)\n   Therefore, Mary was not at the wedding (Not P)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. If Mary had been at the wedding, then Sue would have been there too (according to the first statement). But we know Sue wasn't there, so Mary couldn't have been there either.\n\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
