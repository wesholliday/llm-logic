            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\n   b) The robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"The alien visited Mars\"\n   B = \"The robot visited Jupiter\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"The robot did not visit Jupiter\"\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B\", we can conclude \"not A\"\n\n5. Our situation perfectly fits this logical structure:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\" (If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter)\n   - We have \"not B\" (The robot did not visit Jupiter)\n\n6. Therefore, applying Modus Tollens, we can logically conclude \"not A\", which in this case is \"The alien did not visit Mars\"\n\n7. This conclusion is valid regardless of whether the alien actually visited Mars or not. The logic only tells us that based on the given information, the alien could not have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: yes"
