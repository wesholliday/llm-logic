            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n   b) The wolf was not in the den.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the bear was in the cave\"\n   B = \"the wolf was in the den\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"The wolf was not in the den\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is a classic example of the logical rule called \"Modus Tollens\" (denying the consequent). The structure is:\n   If A, then B\n   Not B\n   Therefore, not A\n\n5. Applying this to our specific scenario:\n   If the bear was in the cave (A), then the wolf was in the den (B)\n   The wolf was not in the den (Not B)\n   Therefore, the bear was not in the cave (Not A)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid because if the initial conditional statement is true, and the consequent (B) is false, then the antecedent (A) must also be false.\n\n7. In other words, if it's true that the wolf being in the den is a necessary consequence of the bear being in the cave, and we know for a fact that the wolf is not in the den, then it logically follows that the bear cannot be in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"
