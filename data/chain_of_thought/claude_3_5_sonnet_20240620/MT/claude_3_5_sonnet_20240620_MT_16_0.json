            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n   b) The pants were not denim.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the shirt was cotton\"\n   B = \"the pants were denim\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"The pants were not denim\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is a classic example of the logical rule called \"Modus Tollens\" (denying the consequent). The rule states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\n5. Applying this rule to our scenario:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\" (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim)\n   - We know that B is false (The pants were not denim)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that A must be false (The shirt was not cotton)\n\n6. This conclusion is logically valid and necessarily follows from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
