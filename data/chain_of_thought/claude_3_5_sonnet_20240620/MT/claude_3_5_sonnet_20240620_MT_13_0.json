            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n   b) The truck was not blue.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"The car was red\"\n   Q = \"The truck was blue\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q: \"The truck was not blue\"\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Tollens (denying the consequent) which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   And \u00acQ (not Q)\n   Then \u00acP (not P)\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   If (car is red) \u2192 (truck is blue)\n   And (truck is not blue)\n   Then (car is not red)\n\n6. Our given statements match this logical structure perfectly.\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically conclude that if the truck is not blue, the car must not be red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
