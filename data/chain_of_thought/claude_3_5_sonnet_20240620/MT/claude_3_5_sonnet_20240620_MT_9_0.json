            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. In logic, this type of statement is called \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent\". The general form is:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n4. In our case:\n   If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q)\n   Mark did not buy the blue shirt (Not Q)\n\n5. Following the modus tollens rule, we can conclude:\n   Therefore, Lisa did not buy the red shirt (Not P)\n\n6. This conclusion is valid because if the conditional statement is true (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt), and we know for certain that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then it must be the case that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If she had, it would contradict the given conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
