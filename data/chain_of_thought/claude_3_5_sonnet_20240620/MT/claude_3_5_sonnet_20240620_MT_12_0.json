            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n   b) Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"Joe went to the park\"\n   Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q: \"Lucy did not go to the zoo\"\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   And \u00acQ (not Q)\n   Then \u00acP (not P)\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   P \u2192 Q: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\n   \u00acQ: Lucy did not go to the zoo\n   Therefore, \u00acP: Joe did not go to the park\n\n6. This logical deduction is valid because if the conditional statement is true, and the consequent (Lucy going to the zoo) is false, then the antecedent (Joe going to the park) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
