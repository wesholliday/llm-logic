            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n   b) The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The griffin was in the forest\n   B: The unicorn was in the forest\n\n3. The second statement directly negates B: The unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as modus tollens (denying the consequent). The structure is:\n   If A, then B\n   Not B\n   Therefore, not A\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If the griffin was in the forest (A), then the unicorn was in the forest (B)\n   The unicorn was not in the forest (Not B)\n   Therefore, the griffin was not in the forest (Not A)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. If the unicorn wasn't in the forest, and the griffin's presence in the forest necessitates the unicorn's presence, then the griffin couldn't have been in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
