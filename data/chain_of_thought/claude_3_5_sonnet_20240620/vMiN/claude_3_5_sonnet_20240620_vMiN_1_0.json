            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, we need to understand what the premise and conclusion mean in modal logic terms:\n   - Premise: \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" can be translated as \"It's possible that Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n   - Conclusion: \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" can be translated as \"It's not necessary that Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\n2. In modal logic, possibility is typically represented by the diamond operator (\u25c7), and necessity by the box operator (\u25a1).\n\n3. So, we can rewrite the argument as:\n   Premise: \u25c7\u00acP (where P stands for \"Mary was at the wedding\")\n   Conclusion: \u00ac\u25a1P\n\n4. Now, let's consider the relationship between possibility and necessity:\n   - If something is possible to be false, it cannot be necessary to be true.\n   - In other words, \u25c7\u00acP implies \u00ac\u25a1P\n\n5. This relationship is actually one of the fundamental axioms of modal logic, known as the duality of possibility and necessity.\n\n6. Therefore, the premise does indeed logically entail the conclusion. If it's possible that Mary was not at the wedding, then it cannot be necessary that she was at the wedding.\n\n7. An argument is considered logically valid if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
