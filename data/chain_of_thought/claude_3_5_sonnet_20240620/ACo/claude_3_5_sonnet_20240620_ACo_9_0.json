            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) Mark bought the blue shirt\n   b) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n2. Statement (a) tells us directly that Mark bought the blue shirt. This is a fact we know for certain.\n\n3. Statement (b) is a conditional statement. It says that IF Lisa bought the red shirt, THEN Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n4. We know from (a) that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n5. The conditional statement (b) only tells us what would happen if Lisa bought the red shirt. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Mark buys the blue shirt independently.\n\n6. This is a case of the logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" Just because the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true, it doesn't mean the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) must be true.\n\n7. For example, Mark could have bought the blue shirt for any number of reasons, regardless of what Lisa did.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
