            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) Sue was at the wedding\n   b) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\n\n2. The second statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = Mary was at the wedding\n   B = Sue was at the wedding\n\n3. We know that B is true (Sue was at the wedding).\n\n4. However, just because B is true, we cannot necessarily conclude that A is true. This is because the conditional statement only tells us what happens if A is true, but it doesn't tell us anything about what happens if B is true.\n\n5. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\" The structure is:\n   If A, then B\n   B is true\n   Therefore, A is true\n   \n   This reasoning is not valid.\n\n6. To illustrate, consider this example:\n   If it's raining, the grass is wet.\n   The grass is wet.\n   Does this mean it's raining? Not necessarily. The grass could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, dew, etc.).\n\n7. In our case, Sue could have been at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's presence. The information given doesn't allow us to determine whether Mary was there or not.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
