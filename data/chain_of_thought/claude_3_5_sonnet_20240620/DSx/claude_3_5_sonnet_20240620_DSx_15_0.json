The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the dreb is vroombed, or it is spened, or possibly both.\n\n3. The second statement explicitly tells us that the dreb is not spened. This eliminates one of the possibilities from the first statement.\n\n4. In logic, this type of reasoning is known as disjunctive syllogism. It follows the form:\n   P or Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, P\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   P: The dreb is vroombed\n   Q: The dreb is spened\n\n   We know (P or Q) is true, and we know (Not Q) is true.\n   Therefore, P must be true.\n\n6. Since we've eliminated the possibility of the dreb being spened, and we know it must be either vroombed or spened, we can conclude that it must be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
