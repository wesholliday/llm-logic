            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked\"\n   b) \"The splat is not quanked\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the splat is morphed, or it is quanked, or both.\n\n3. The second statement explicitly tells us that the splat is not quanked. This eliminates one of the possibilities from the first statement.\n\n4. In logical terms, we can represent this as:\n   (Morphed OR Quanked) AND (NOT Quanked)\n\n5. Since we know for certain that the splat is not quanked, the only remaining possibility from the first statement is that the splat is morphed.\n\n6. This is an example of disjunctive syllogism, a valid logical argument form:\n   P or Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, P\n\n7. In this case:\n   P = \"The splat is morphed\"\n   Q = \"The splat is quanked\"\n\n8. Given that Q is false, P must be true for the original disjunction to hold.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The splat is morphed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
