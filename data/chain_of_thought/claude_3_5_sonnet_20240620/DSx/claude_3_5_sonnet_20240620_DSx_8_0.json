We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled\"\n   b) \"The sprocket is not daggled\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the sprocket is cranked, or it is daggled, or both.\n\n3. The second statement explicitly tells us that the sprocket is not daggled. This eliminates one of the possibilities from the first statement.\n\n4. In formal logic, this type of reasoning is known as disjunctive syllogism. It follows the form:\n   P or Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, P\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   P: The sprocket is cranked\n   Q: The sprocket is daggled\n\n   We know \"P or Q\" is true, and we know \"Not Q\" is true.\n\n6. Since we know the sprocket is not daggled (Not Q), and we know it must be either cranked or daggled (P or Q), the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked (P).\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
