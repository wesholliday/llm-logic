We have two given statements:\n   a) \"Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled\"\n   b) \"The wug is not garpled\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the wug is sproinged, or it is garpled, or both.\n\n3. The second statement explicitly tells us that the wug is not garpled. This eliminates one of the possibilities from the first statement.\n\n4. In formal logic, this type of reasoning is known as disjunctive syllogism. It follows the form:\n   P or Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, P\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   P: The wug is sproinged\n   Q: The wug is garpled\n\n   We know \"P or Q\" is true, and we know \"Not Q\" is true.\n\n6. Since we know the wug is not garpled (Not Q), and we know it must be either sproinged or garpled, the only remaining possibility is that the wug is sproinged.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the wug is sproinged.\n\nAnswer: yes"
