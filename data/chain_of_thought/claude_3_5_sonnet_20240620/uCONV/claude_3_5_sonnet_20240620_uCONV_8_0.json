We're given the statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer the reverse: \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n   This would be the converse of the original statement, in the form \"If B, then A.\"\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   - The vampire could be awake, and the mummy is awake (satisfies the original statement)\n   - The vampire could be asleep, and the mummy is awake (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   - The vampire could be asleep, and the mummy is asleep (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n\n5. The second possibility (vampire asleep, mummy awake) shows that the mummy can be awake without the vampire being awake.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if the mummy was awake, then the vampire was necessarily awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
