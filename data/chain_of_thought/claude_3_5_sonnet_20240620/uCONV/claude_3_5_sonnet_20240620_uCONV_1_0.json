            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer the reverse: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n   This would be the converse of the original statement, in the form \"If B, then A.\"\n\n3. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   - Mary could be at the wedding, which means Sue would definitely be there too.\n   - Sue could be at the wedding without Mary being there. The original statement doesn't rule this out.\n\n5. The original statement only tells us that Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence, but it doesn't say anything about whether Sue's presence guarantees Mary's presence.\n\n6. We can't conclude that Sue's presence implies Mary's presence based solely on the given information.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot make this inference with certainty.\n\nAnswer: no"
