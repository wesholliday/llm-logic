This statement only provides information about the potential formality of the event.\n3. It doesn't mention anything about tickets or any requirements for attendance.\n4. The proposed inference adds new information: \"and require tickets.\"\n5. While it's possible that a formal event might require tickets, this is not necessarily true for all formal events.\n6. The original statement doesn't give us any information to support or deny the ticket requirement.\n7. Adding this extra information goes beyond what we can logically infer from the given statement.\n8. In logic, we cannot make inferences that add new information not implied by the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer \"The event might be formal and require tickets\" from the original statement \"The event might be formal.\" The inference adds information that is not present in or necessarily implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
