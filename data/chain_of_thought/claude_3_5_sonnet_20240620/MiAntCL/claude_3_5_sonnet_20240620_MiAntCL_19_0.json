            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The application might be completed online.\"\n2. This statement only provides information about the possibility of completing the application online.\n3. It doesn't mention anything about the content of the application or what it might include.\n4. The proposed inference adds new information: \"and include references.\"\n5. While it's possible that an online application could include references, we cannot infer this from the given statement alone.\n6. The original statement doesn't provide any information about the application's contents or requirements.\n7. Adding \"include references\" goes beyond the scope of the information provided in the original statement.\n8. Inferring additional details that aren't explicitly stated or logically implied would be an unsupported assumption.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the application might include references based solely on the information given in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
