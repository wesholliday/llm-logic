            "content": "Explanation: Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The document might be signed.\"\n2. This statement only addresses the possibility of the document being signed.\n3. It does not mention anything about notarization.\n4. The proposed inference adds a new element: \"and notarized.\"\n5. While it's possible for a document to be both signed and notarized, we cannot infer this from the original statement.\n6. The original statement allows for the possibility of signing but does not imply or suggest notarization.\n7. Adding \"and notarized\" introduces new information that is not present or implied in the original statement.\n8. In logical reasoning, we cannot infer more information than what is given or directly implied by the original statement.\n9. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The document might be signed and notarized\" from the statement \"The document might be signed.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
