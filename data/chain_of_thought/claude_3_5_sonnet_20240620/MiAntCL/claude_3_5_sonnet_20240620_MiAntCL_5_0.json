            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The package might be delivered today.\"\n2. This statement only expresses the possibility of delivery, without any additional information about what happens after delivery.\n3. The proposed inference adds a new element: \"and signed for.\"\n4. Signing for a package is often a part of the delivery process, but it's not always necessary or guaranteed.\n5. Some deliveries may be left without a signature, depending on the sender's instructions or the delivery company's policies.\n6. The original statement doesn't provide any information about whether a signature will be required or obtained.\n7. By adding \"and signed for,\" we're introducing new information that isn't implied by the original statement.\n8. Logically, we can't infer additional details that aren't contained within or necessarily implied by the given information.\n9. While it's possible that the package might be signed for upon delivery, we can't infer this from the original statement alone.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the expanded statement from the original one, as it includes additional information not present in or necessarily implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
