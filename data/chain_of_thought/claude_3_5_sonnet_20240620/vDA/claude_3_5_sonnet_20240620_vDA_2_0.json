            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B (If griffin in forest, then unicorn in forest)\n   Premise 2: Not A (Griffin not in forest)\n   Conclusion: Not B (Unicorn not in forest)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as denying the antecedent. It's important to recognize this pattern.\n\n3. To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider a scenario:\n   - The griffin is not in the forest (satisfying premise 2)\n   - The unicorn IS in the forest (opposite of the conclusion)\n\n5. Does this scenario contradict premise 1? No, it doesn't. Premise 1 only tells us what happens if the griffin IS in the forest. It doesn't say anything about where the unicorn is if the griffin is NOT in the forest.\n\n6. Therefore, we've found a scenario where both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.\n\n7. The existence of such a scenario proves that this argument form is not logically valid. The truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
