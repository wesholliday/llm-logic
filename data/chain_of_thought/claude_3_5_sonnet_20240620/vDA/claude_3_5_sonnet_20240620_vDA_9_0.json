            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not A\n   Conclusion: Not B\n\n   Where A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent\" or \"inverse error.\"\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider a scenario:\n   - Lisa didn't buy the red shirt (satisfying premise 2)\n   - Mark bought the blue shirt anyway (contradicting the conclusion)\n\n5. This scenario doesn't violate the first premise because it only states what would happen if Lisa bought the red shirt. It doesn't say anything about what happens if she doesn't buy it.\n\n6. Since we can construct a scenario where both premises are true but the conclusion is false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\n7. The error in this reasoning is assuming that if the antecedent (Lisa buying the red shirt) is false, then the consequent (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be false. This is not a necessary logical connection.\n\nAnswer: no"
