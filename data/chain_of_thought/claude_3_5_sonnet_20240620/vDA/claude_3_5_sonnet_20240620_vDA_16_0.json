            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim)\n   Premise 2: Not A (The shirt was not cotton)\n   Conclusion: Not B (The pants were not denim)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent\" or \"inverse error.\"\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider a scenario:\n   - The shirt is polyester (not cotton)\n   - The pants are denim\n\n5. In this scenario:\n   - Premise 1 is true (because it doesn't say anything about non-cotton shirts)\n   - Premise 2 is true (the shirt is not cotton)\n   - But the conclusion is false (the pants are denim)\n\n6. Since we can construct a scenario where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\n7. The error in this reasoning is assuming that if the antecedent (A) is false, then the consequent (B) must also be false. However, the original statement only tells us what happens if A is true, not what happens if A is false.\n\nAnswer: no"
