            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (where P = \"Joe went to the park\" and Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\")\n   Premise 2: Not P (Joe did not go to the park)\n   Conclusion: Not Q (Lucy did not go to the zoo)\n\n2. This argument form is known as denying the antecedent. It's important to recognize this form because it's a common logical fallacy.\n\n3. To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. If such a scenario exists, the argument is not valid.\n\n4. Let's consider the possible scenarios:\n   a) Joe didn't go to the park (which satisfies Premise 2), and Lucy went to the zoo.\n   b) Joe didn't go to the park, and Lucy didn't go to the zoo.\n\n5. Both of these scenarios are consistent with the premises. The first premise only tells us what happens if Joe goes to the park; it doesn't say anything about what happens if Joe doesn't go to the park.\n\n6. In scenario (a), the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This demonstrates that it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n7. Therefore, this argument form is not logically valid. The truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: no"
