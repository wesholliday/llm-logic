            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\n   Premise 2: Not P (The dog was not inside)\n   Conclusion: Not Q (The cat was not outside)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as denying the antecedent. It follows the structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not P\n   Therefore, Not Q\n\n3. To determine if this is logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider a scenario:\n   - The dog could be outside (satisfying \"The dog was not inside\")\n   - The cat could still be outside (contradicting \"The cat was not outside\")\n   - This scenario doesn't violate the first premise \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" because the dog isn't inside.\n\n5. In this scenario, both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. This demonstrates that it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n6. For an argument to be logically valid, it must be impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false. Since we've found a counterexample, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
