            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not A\n   Conclusion: Not B\n\n2. This form of argument is known as denying the antecedent.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider a scenario:\n   - The apple is not red (satisfying premise 2)\n   - The banana is yellow\n\n5. In this scenario, premise 1 is still true because it only states what would happen if the apple was red, which it isn't.\n\n6. Premise 2 is true by our assumption.\n\n7. However, the conclusion (the banana is not yellow) is false in this scenario.\n\n8. Since we've found a case where both premises can be true while the conclusion is false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\n9. The error in this reasoning is assuming that if the antecedent (A) is false, then the consequent (B) must also be false. This is not a necessary logical connection.\n\nAnswer: no"
