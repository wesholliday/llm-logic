            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake)\n   Premise 2: Not A (The vampire was not awake)\n   Conclusion: Not B (The mummy was not awake)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as \"denying the antecedent\" or \"inverse error.\"\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider a scenario:\n   - The vampire is not awake (satisfying premise 2)\n   - The mummy is awake (contradicting the conclusion)\n\n5. Does this scenario violate premise 1? No, it doesn't. Premise 1 only tells us what happens if the vampire is awake; it doesn't say anything about what happens if the vampire is not awake.\n\n6. Therefore, we can have a situation where both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.\n\n7. In formal logic, an argument is only considered valid if it's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n8. Since we've found a scenario where the premises can be true and the conclusion false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
