            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   Premise 2: Mary was not at the wedding.\n   Conclusion: Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n2. This argument form is known as \"denying the antecedent\" or \"inverse error.\" It's important to recognize this pattern.\n\n3. Let's consider the logical form:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not P\n   Therefore, Not Q\n\n4. To determine if this is logically valid, we need to ask: Is it possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false?\n\n5. Let's consider a scenario:\n   - It's true that if Mary was at the wedding, Sue was there (Premise 1 is true)\n   - Mary indeed was not at the wedding (Premise 2 is true)\n   - However, Sue could still have been at the wedding even if Mary wasn't there\n\n6. This scenario shows that it's possible for both premises to be true while the conclusion is false. Sue's presence at the wedding is not necessarily dependent on Mary's presence.\n\n7. For an argument to be logically valid, there must be no possible scenario where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. We've found such a scenario, so this argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
