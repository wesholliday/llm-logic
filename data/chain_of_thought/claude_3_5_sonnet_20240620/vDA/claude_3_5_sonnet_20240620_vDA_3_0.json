            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n   Premise 2: Not P (The book was not written by James)\n   Conclusion: Not Q (The book is not a mystery novel)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as denying the antecedent. It's important to recognize this pattern.\n\n3. To determine if an argument is logically valid, we need to check if it's possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider a scenario:\n   - The book was not written by James (satisfying premise 2)\n   - The book is a mystery novel (contradicting the conclusion)\n\n5. Does this scenario contradict premise 1? No, it doesn't. Premise 1 only tells us what happens if James wrote the book. It doesn't say anything about books not written by James.\n\n6. This means we can have a situation where both premises are true, but the conclusion is false.\n\n7. Therefore, this argument form is not logically valid. The truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\n8. It's worth noting that while this argument is not valid, the conclusion could still be true in some cases. However, it doesn't necessarily follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: no"
