            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The wibble must be frazzle for a quibble\"\n2. The proposed inference adds an additional condition: \"and be zibber\"\n3. In logical terms, the original statement is A, and the proposed inference is A AND B\n4. When we add an additional condition to a statement, we are making it more specific and restrictive\n5. A more specific statement cannot be logically inferred from a more general one\n6. The original statement does not provide any information about the wibble needing to \"be zibber\"\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the proposed statement from the given one\n8. Adding extra conditions or requirements to a statement without additional supporting information is not a valid logical inference\n\nAnswer: no"
