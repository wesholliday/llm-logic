The original statement is: \"The zizz must be zibber flim wumble\"\n2. The proposed inference is: \"The zizz must be zibber flim wumble and flimble a zibble\"\n\nLet's break this down:\n- The first part of the proposed inference is identical to the original statement.\n- However, the proposed inference adds an additional clause: \"and flimble a zibble\"\n\nIn logical reasoning, we cannot infer additional information that is not present or implied in the original statement. The original statement makes no mention of \"flimble\" or \"zibble\", nor does it imply anything about these terms.\n\nThe proposed inference is essentially adding new information that is not contained in or logically derivable from the original statement. We cannot assume or infer this additional information without further context or premises.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
