This statement only asserts one thing about the froodle - that it must be flump.\n3. The proposed inference adds two additional claims:\n   a) The froodle must be glorp\n   b) The froodle must be glorp by frazzle\n\n4. These additional claims are not present in or implied by the original statement.\n5. We cannot logically infer information that isn't contained within or directly implied by the given premise.\n6. Adding new, unrelated information to a statement changes its meaning and cannot be considered a valid inference.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The froodle must be flump and be glorp by frazzle\" from the original statement \"The froodle must be flump.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
