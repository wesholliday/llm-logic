The original statement is: \"The bimboozle must be on the plonk\"\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"The bimboozle must be on the plonk and froodle a wobble quank\"\n\nLet's break this down:\n- The first part of both statements is identical: \"The bimboozle must be on the plonk\"\n- The second statement adds an additional clause: \"and froodle a wobble quank\"\n\nIn formal logic, we cannot infer a more specific or complex statement from a simpler one without additional information. The original statement only tells us about the bimboozle being on the plonk. It doesn't provide any information about froodling a wobble quank.\n\nAdding new information that wasn't present in the original statement is not a valid logical inference. We can't assume or infer anything about froodling a wobble quank based solely on the information given in the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one. The second statement contains additional information that is not present in or implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
