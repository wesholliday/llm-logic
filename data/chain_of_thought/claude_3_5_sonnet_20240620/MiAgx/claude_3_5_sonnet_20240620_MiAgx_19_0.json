            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The crunk might be wibble fribble and the frazzle might quork snork\"\n\n2. We need to determine if this is equivalent to: \"It might be that the crunk is wibble fribble and the frazzle quorks snork\"\n\n3. Let's compare the two parts of each statement:\n   a) \"The crunk might be wibble fribble\" vs. \"the crunk is wibble fribble\"\n   b) \"the frazzle might quork snork\" vs. \"the frazzle quorks snork\"\n\n4. In the first part (a), both statements express possibility. The original uses \"might be\" and the inference uses \"It might be that... is\". These are logically equivalent.\n\n5. In the second part (b), the original statement uses \"might quork\" while the inference uses \"quorks\". This is a slight change in verb form, but it still maintains the sense of possibility due to the \"It might be that\" at the beginning of the sentence.\n\n6. The overall structure of both statements expresses possibility for both parts, and the meaning is preserved.\n\n7. The inference is a valid rephrasing of the original statement, maintaining the same logical meaning and sense of possibility.\n\nAnswer: yes"
