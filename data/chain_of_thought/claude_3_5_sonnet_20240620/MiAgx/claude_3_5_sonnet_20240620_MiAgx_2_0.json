            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement uses \"might be\" and \"might wozzle\" to express possibility.\n\n2. The inference also uses \"might be\" to express possibility, maintaining the uncertain nature of the original statement.\n\n3. The first part of both statements is essentially identical: \"The frazzle might be on the zump\" vs. \"It might be that the frazzle is on the zump\".\n\n4. The second part changes from \"the gribble might wozzle a frazzle grooble\" to \"the gribble wozzles a frazzle grooble\".\n\n5. This change removes the \"might\" before \"wozzle\", which slightly alters the level of certainty in this part of the statement.\n\n6. However, the overall meaning and possibility is preserved by the phrase \"It might be that\" at the beginning of the inference, which applies to both parts of the statement.\n\n7. The core elements (frazzle, zump, gribble, wozzle, frazzle grooble) and their relationships remain the same in both statements.\n\n8. The inference is a valid rephrasing of the original statement, maintaining the overall sense of possibility and the relationships between the elements.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the inference is logically consistent with the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
