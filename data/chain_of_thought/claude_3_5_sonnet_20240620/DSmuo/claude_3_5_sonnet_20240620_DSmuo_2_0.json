            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the book must be resting on the table\"\n   b) \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\"\n\n2. Let's analyze the first statement:\n   - It doesn't say the book is not on the table, only that it's not necessarily on the table.\n   - This means the book could be on the table, but it doesn't have to be.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the second statement:\n   - This is an \"either-or\" statement, which means one of the two options must be true.\n   - The options are: \"the book is on the shelf\" or \"it must be resting on the table\"\n\n4. Combining the information:\n   - From the first statement, we know that \"it must be resting on the table\" is false.\n   - In the second statement, if one part of an \"either-or\" statement is false, the other must be true.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - Since \"it must be resting on the table\" is false, the other option in the \"either-or\" statement must be true.\n   - Therefore, \"The book is on the shelf\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
