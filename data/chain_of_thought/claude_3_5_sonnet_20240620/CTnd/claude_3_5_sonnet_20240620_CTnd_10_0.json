First, let's break down the given statement: \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\"\n   This can be translated into logical form as: A \u2192 ~H\n   Where A = \"advice was offered\" and H = \"helpful advice\"\n\n2. The statement we're trying to infer is: \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\"\n   This can be translated into logical form as: H \u2192 ~A\n\n3. To determine if we can infer the second statement from the first, we need to see if it's logically equivalent or a valid conclusion.\n\n4. The original statement (A \u2192 ~H) is equivalent to its contrapositive: H \u2192 ~A\n\n5. The contrapositive is exactly the statement we're trying to infer!\n\n6. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are always logically equivalent. This means we can indeed infer one from the other.\n\nTherefore, we can validly infer \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" from the original statement \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
