First, let's understand the given statement: \"If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly.\"\n   This can be represented logically as: Greeted \u2192 Not (Greeted Warmly)\n\n2. Now, we need to determine if we can infer: \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted.\"\n   This would be represented as: Greeted Warmly \u2192 Not (Greeted)\n\n3. To check if this inference is valid, we can use the logical rule of contraposition. \n   The contrapositive of a statement \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n4. The contrapositive of our original statement would be:\n   \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted.\"\n\n5. This contrapositive is exactly the statement we're trying to infer.\n\n6. Since the contrapositive of a true statement is always true, and the contrapositive matches our inference, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
