The given statement is: If P, then not Q\n   This can be written logically as: P \u2192 ~Q\n\n3. We're asked if we can infer: If Q, then not P\n   This would be written logically as: Q \u2192 ~P\n\n4. To determine if we can infer this, we need to check if Q \u2192 ~P is logically equivalent to P \u2192 ~Q\n\n5. In propositional logic, the contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts and reversing the order.\n\n6. The contrapositive of P \u2192 ~Q would be Q \u2192 ~P\n\n7. This is exactly the statement we're asked about!\n\n8. Therefore, the statement \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\" is indeed the contrapositive of the given statement and can be logically inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: yes"
