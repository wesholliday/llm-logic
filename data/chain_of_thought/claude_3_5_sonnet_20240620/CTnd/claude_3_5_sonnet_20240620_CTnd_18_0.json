            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where:\n   A = \"the issue was discussed\"\n   B = \"it was discussed in depth\"\n\n2. The statement we're trying to infer has this structure:\n   \"If B, then not A\" where:\n   B = \"the issue was discussed in depth\"\n   A = \"the issue was discussed\"\n\n3. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. To see why, let's consider the truth table:\n   - If A is true and B is false, the original statement is true.\n   - If A is false, the original statement is true regardless of B.\n   - The only way the original statement can be false is if A is true and B is true.\n\n5. Now, let's look at the contrapositive:\n   - If B is true, A must be false for the original statement to hold.\n   - If B is false, the contrapositive is true regardless of A.\n\n6. This matches the truth conditions of the original statement.\n\n7. However, there's a logical issue with the specific content of these statements. The statement \"the issue was discussed in depth\" necessarily implies that \"the issue was discussed\". It's impossible for something to be discussed in depth without being discussed at all.\n\n8. This creates a paradox in the original statement, making it self-contradictory and therefore invalid in terms of real-world logic.\n\n9. Despite this real-world logical issue, in terms of pure propositional logic, the contrapositive is still valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
