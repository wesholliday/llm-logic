The given statement can be written as: If P, then not Q\n   This is a conditional statement in the form: P \u2192 ~Q\n\n3. The statement we're asked about can be written as: If Q, then not P\n   This is a conditional statement in the form: Q \u2192 ~P\n\n4. In logic, these two forms (P \u2192 ~Q and Q \u2192 ~P) are actually logically equivalent. This relationship is known as contraposition.\n\n5. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P\".\n\n6. This means that the two statements convey the same logical information and can be inferred from each other.\n\n7. Therefore, if we accept the first statement as true, we can logically infer that the second statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
