            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's understand the given statement: \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\"\n   This means that when it's raining, it cannot be raining hard at the same time.\n\n2. Now, let's look at the statement we're trying to infer: \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\"\n   This statement suggests that when it's raining hard, it cannot be raining at all.\n\n3. Let's consider the logical relationship between \"raining\" and \"raining hard\":\n   - \"Raining hard\" is a subset of \"raining\". In other words, if it's raining hard, it is definitely raining.\n\n4. Given this relationship, we can see that the statement we're trying to infer is self-contradictory:\n   - It's saying that if it's raining hard (which is a form of raining), then it's not raining at all.\n\n5. This contradicts the basic logical relationship between \"raining\" and \"raining hard\".\n\n6. The original statement allows for the possibility of light rain or moderate rain, but excludes heavy rain when it's raining.\n\n7. The inferred statement, however, completely separates \"raining hard\" from \"raining\", which is not logically consistent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one. The inference is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
