The given statement can be written as: If P, then not Q\n   This is a conditional statement in the form: P \u2192 ~Q\n\n3. The statement we're asked about can be written as: If Q, then not P\n   This is in the form: Q \u2192 ~P\n\n4. In logic, these two statements are not equivalent. The second statement is actually the contrapositive of the inverse of the first statement.\n\n5. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" would be \"If Q, then not P\", which is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n6. However, we can't automatically infer the contrapositive of the inverse from the original statement.\n\n7. To illustrate this, consider a scenario where no recommendation was made at all. This scenario doesn't contradict the original statement, but it would contradict the statement we're asked about.\n\n8. Furthermore, the original statement allows for the possibility of weak or moderate recommendations, which are neither strong recommendations nor \"not recommendations.\"\n\n9. Therefore, while the original statement tells us that strong recommendations are excluded when a recommendation is made, it doesn't necessarily mean that a strong recommendation implies no recommendation was made at all.\n\nAnswer: no"
