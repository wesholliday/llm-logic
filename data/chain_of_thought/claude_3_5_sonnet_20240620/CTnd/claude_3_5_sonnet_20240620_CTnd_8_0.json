            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where:\n   A = \"the issue was addressed\"\n   B = \"it was addressed effectively\"\n\n2. The statement we're trying to infer has the structure:\n   \"If B, then not A\"\n\n3. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. However, we need to be careful because we're dealing with a negative consequence in the original statement.\n\n4. Let's break it down:\n   Original: If A, then not B\n   Contrapositive: If B, then not (not A)\n\n5. The double negative in the contrapositive (not (not A)) actually becomes a positive, so it simplifies to:\n   If B, then A\n\n6. Translating this back to our original terms:\n   \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was addressed\"\n\n7. This is the logical equivalent of the original statement and is always true if the original statement is true.\n\n8. However, the statement we're asked about is:\n   \"If the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed\"\n\n9. This is the opposite of what we derived in step 6.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the given statement from the original premise. It contradicts the logical consequence of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
