The given statement is: If P, then not Q\n   This can be written logically as: P \u2192 \u00acQ\n\n3. We're asked if we can infer: If Q, then not P\n   This would be written logically as: Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\n4. To determine if we can infer this, we need to consider if Q \u2192 \u00acP is logically equivalent to P \u2192 \u00acQ\n\n5. In propositional logic, these two statements are indeed logically equivalent. This equivalence is known as contraposition.\n\n6. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is always \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\n7. In our case, we start with \"If P, then not Q\", so its contrapositive would be \"If Q, then not P\"\n\n8. Therefore, the statement we're asked about is the contrapositive of the given statement, and thus can be logically inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: yes"
