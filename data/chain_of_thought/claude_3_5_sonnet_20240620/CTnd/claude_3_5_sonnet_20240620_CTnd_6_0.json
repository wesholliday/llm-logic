            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the original statement:\n   \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\"\n\n2. We can represent this logically as:\n   If A (clothes were washed), then not B (not washed properly)\n\n3. The statement we're trying to infer is:\n   \"If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed\"\n\n4. This can be represented as:\n   If B (washed properly), then not A (not washed)\n\n5. This is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n6. To see this more clearly:\n   Original: If A, then not B\n   Contrapositive: If B, then not A\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always true if the original statement is true, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\n8. Another way to think about it: If all washed clothes are not washed properly, then any clothes that are washed properly must not have been washed (according to the original statement's logic).\n\nAnswer: yes"
