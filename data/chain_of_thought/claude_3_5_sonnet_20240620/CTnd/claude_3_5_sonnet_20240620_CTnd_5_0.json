            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   P: The room was cleaned\n   Q: The room was cleaned thoroughly\n\n2. The given statement can be written as: If P, then not Q\n   This is a conditional statement in the form: P \u2192 ~Q\n\n3. The statement we're asked about can be written as: If Q, then not P\n   This is a conditional statement in the form: Q \u2192 ~P\n\n4. In logic, these two forms (P \u2192 ~Q and Q \u2192 ~P) are actually logically equivalent. This relationship is known as contraposition.\n\n5. The contrapositive of \"If P, then not Q\" is \"If Q, then not P\".\n\n6. This means that our original statement \"If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly\" is logically equivalent to \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\".\n\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
