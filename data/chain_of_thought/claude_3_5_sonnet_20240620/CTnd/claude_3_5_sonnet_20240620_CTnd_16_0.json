First, let's define our statements:\n   P: The job was completed\n   Q: The job was completed well\n\n2. The given statement \"If the job was completed, then it was not completed well\" can be written as:\n   P \u2192 ~Q (where ~ means \"not\")\n\n3. We're asked if we can infer \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\", which would be:\n   Q \u2192 ~P\n\n4. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. In propositional logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent.\n\n5. To see this, let's consider the truth table for P \u2192 ~Q:\n   P | Q | ~Q | P \u2192 ~Q\n   T | T | F  | F\n   T | F | T  | T\n   F | T | F  | T\n   F | F | T  | T\n\n6. Now, let's look at the truth table for Q \u2192 ~P:\n   P | Q | ~P | Q \u2192 ~P\n   T | T | F  | F\n   T | F | F  | T\n   F | T | T  | T\n   F | F | T  | T\n\n7. As we can see, the truth tables for P \u2192 ~Q and Q \u2192 ~P are identical, which means they are logically equivalent.\n\n8. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"If the job was completed well, then it was not completed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
