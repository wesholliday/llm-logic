            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   P: Ben studied\n   Q: Ben studied diligently\n\n2. The given statement is: If P, then not Q\n   This can be written in logical form as: P \u2192 ~Q\n\n3. We're asked if we can infer: If Q, then not P\n   In logical form, this would be: Q \u2192 ~P\n\n4. To determine if this inference is valid, we need to consider all possible scenarios:\n\n   a) If Ben studied diligently (Q is true), then according to the original statement, he did not study (P must be false). This supports the inference.\n\n   b) If Ben did not study diligently (~Q is true), the original statement doesn't tell us anything definitive about whether he studied or not. P could be either true or false.\n\n5. The key here is that the original statement tells us that studying (P) implies not studying diligently (~Q). This is logically equivalent to saying that studying diligently (Q) implies not studying (~P).\n\n6. This equivalence is known as the contrapositive in logic. The contrapositive of \"if P, then Q\" is always \"if not Q, then not P\", and they are logically equivalent.\n\n7. In this case, \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\" is logically equivalent to \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\".\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the given statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
