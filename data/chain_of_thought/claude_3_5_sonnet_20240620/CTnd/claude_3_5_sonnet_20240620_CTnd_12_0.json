We can represent this logically as:\n   If A (Jane studied), then not B (she did not study long)\n\n3. The statement we're trying to infer is:\n   \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\"\n\n4. This can be represented as:\n   If B (Jane studied long), then not A (she did not study)\n\n5. Now, let's consider the logical relationship between these statements:\n   - The original statement tells us that studying (A) implies not studying long (not B)\n   - The statement we're trying to infer is the contrapositive of this\n\n6. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the conditional and reversing their order.\n\n7. So, \"If A, then not B\" is logically equivalent to \"If B, then not A\"\n\n8. Therefore, the statement \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study\" is indeed a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
