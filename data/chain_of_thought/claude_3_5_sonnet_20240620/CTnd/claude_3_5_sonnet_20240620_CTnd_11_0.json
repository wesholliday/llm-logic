            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. First, let's define our statements:\n   P: I went to the store\n   Q: I bought vegetables\n\n2. The given statement \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" can be written as:\n   P \u2192 ~Q (where ~ means \"not\")\n\n3. We want to know if we can infer: Q \u2192 ~P\n\n4. This is a question of logical equivalence. Specifically, we're asking if P \u2192 ~Q is logically equivalent to Q \u2192 ~P.\n\n5. In propositional logic, this transformation is known as contraposition. The contrapositive of \"if P, then Q\" is \"if not Q, then not P\".\n\n6. The contrapositive of our original statement P \u2192 ~Q would be Q \u2192 ~P.\n\n7. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that P \u2192 ~Q and Q \u2192 ~P always have the same truth value.\n\n8. Therefore, \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" is logically equivalent to \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\".\n\n9. Since these statements are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: yes"
