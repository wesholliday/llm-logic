The given statement is: If P, then not Q\n   This can be written logically as: P \u2192 \u00acQ\n\n3. The statement we're asked about is: If Q, then not P\n   This can be written logically as: Q \u2192 \u00acP\n\n4. These two statements (P \u2192 \u00acQ and Q \u2192 \u00acP) are actually logical converses of each other.\n\n5. In logic, the converse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true. They are not logically equivalent.\n\n6. Let's consider a concrete example:\n   - If I ate a meal (P), then I did not eat a large meal (\u00acQ). This could be true.\n   - But it doesn't necessarily mean that if I ate a large meal (Q), I didn't eat a meal (\u00acP). In fact, a large meal is still a meal.\n\n7. The original statement allows for the possibility of eating a small or medium meal, but the inferred statement would incorrectly suggest that a large meal is not a meal at all.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: no"
