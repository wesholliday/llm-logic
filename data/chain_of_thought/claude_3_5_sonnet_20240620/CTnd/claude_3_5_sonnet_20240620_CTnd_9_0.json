First, let's define our statements:\n   P: Instructions were given\n   Q: Instructions were explained clearly\n\n2. The original statement can be written as: P \u2192 ~Q\n   (If P, then not Q)\n\n3. We're asked if we can infer: Q \u2192 ~P\n   (If Q, then not P)\n\n4. This is actually the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. To form the contrapositive:\n   - We negate both parts of the original statement\n   - We reverse the order\n\n6. Original: P \u2192 ~Q\n   Contrapositive: Q \u2192 ~P\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
