The original statement can be written as: P \u2192 ~C\n   (If the meal was prepared, then it was not prepared carefully)\n\n3. We're asked if we can infer: C \u2192 ~P\n   (If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared)\n\n4. This is actually the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. To form the contrapositive:\n   - We negate both parts of the original statement\n   - We reverse the order\n\n6. Original: P \u2192 ~C\n   Contrapositive: C \u2192 ~P\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer this new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
