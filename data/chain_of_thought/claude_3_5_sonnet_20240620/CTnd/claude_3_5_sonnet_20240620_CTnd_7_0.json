The given statement \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly\" can be written logically as:\n   P \u2192 ~Q (where ~ means \"not\")\n\n3. We're asked if we can infer \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\", which would be:\n   Q \u2192 ~P\n\n4. This is actually the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. To see this more clearly:\n   Original: P \u2192 ~Q\n   Contrapositive: Q \u2192 ~P\n\n6. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the implication and reversing the order.\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
