            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the original statement:\n   \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"the splat was morphed\"\n   Q = \"the splat did not quank\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\"\n\n4. This new statement is the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n5. Let's break it down:\n   - Original: If P, then Q\n   - Contrapositive: If not Q, then not P\n\n6. In our case:\n   - Not Q = \"the splat quank\" (negation of \"did not quank\")\n   - Not P = \"the splat was not morphed\" (negation of \"was morphed\")\n\n7. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\n8. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
