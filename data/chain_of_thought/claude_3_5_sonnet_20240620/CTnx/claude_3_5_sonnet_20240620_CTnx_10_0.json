            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where A is \"the wug was sproinged\" and B is \"it was garpled\"\n\n2. This statement tells us that when A is true, B must be false. In other words, A and B cannot both be true at the same time.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the statement we're trying to infer:\n   \"If B, then not A\"\n\n4. This statement is saying that when B is true, A must be false. Again, B and A cannot both be true at the same time.\n\n5. Let's consider all possible combinations:\n   - If A is true, B must be false (from the original statement)\n   - If B is true, A must be false (from the statement we're trying to infer)\n   - If A is false, B could be either true or false\n   - If B is false, A could be either true or false\n\n6. We can see that these two statements are actually saying the same thing, just from different perspectives. They both assert that A and B cannot be true simultaneously.\n\n7. In formal logic, this relationship is known as contraposition. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\", and they are logically equivalent.\n\n8. In this case, \"If the wug was garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and is logically equivalent to it.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
