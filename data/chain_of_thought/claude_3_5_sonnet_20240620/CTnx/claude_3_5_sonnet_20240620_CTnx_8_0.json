            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then not B,\" where:\n   A = \"the sprocket was cranked\"\n   B = \"the sprocket was daggled\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n   This is in the form \"If B, then not A.\"\n\n4. In logic, this type of inference is called the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is \"If B, then not A.\"\n\n5. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n6. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"If the sprocket was daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\" from the original statement.\n\n7. This inference is valid because if being cranked means it's not daggled, then being daggled must mean it's not cranked. These two conditions are mutually exclusive.\n\nAnswer: yes"
