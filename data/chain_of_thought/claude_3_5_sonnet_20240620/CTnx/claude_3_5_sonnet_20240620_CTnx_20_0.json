            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where A is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and B is \"it did surn\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If B, then not A\"\n\n3. This is a form of logical contraposition. In formal logic, the contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". These two statements are logically equivalent.\n\n4. In our case, we're starting with \"If A, then not B\". The contrapositive of this would be \"If B, then not A\".\n\n5. Let's verify:\n   Original: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn\"\n   Contrapositive: \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered\"\n\n6. We can see that the statement we're asked about is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n7. Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: yes"
