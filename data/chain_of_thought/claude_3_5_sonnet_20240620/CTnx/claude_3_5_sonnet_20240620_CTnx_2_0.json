            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where:\n   A = \"the wug was flooped\"\n   B = \"the wug bimmed the zoint\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If B, then not A\"\n\n3. This is a form of logical contraposition. In formal logic, the contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\". These two statements are logically equivalent.\n\n4. In our case, we're dealing with \"If A, then not B\". The contrapositive of this would be \"If B, then not A\".\n\n5. Let's break it down:\n   Original: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\"\n   Contrapositive: \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\"\n\n6. As we can see, the contrapositive matches exactly with the statement we're asked about in the question.\n\n7. Since the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
