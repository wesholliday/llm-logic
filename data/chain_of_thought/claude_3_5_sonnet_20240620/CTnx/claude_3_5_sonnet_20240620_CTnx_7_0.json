            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where A is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and B is \"the whiffle did tink\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If B, then not A\"\n\n3. This is a form of logical contraposition. In propositional logic, a statement of the form \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to its contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n4. In our case, we start with \"If A, then not B\". The contrapositive of this would be \"If B, then not A\"\n\n5. Therefore, the statement \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\" is logically equivalent to \"If the whiffle did tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\"\n\n6. This means that we can indeed infer the second statement from the first one, as they are logically equivalent.\n\nAnswer: yes"
