            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where:\n   A = \"the grommet was sploffed\"\n   B = \"the grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If B, then not A\"\n\n3. This is a form of logical contraposition. In formal logic, the contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". These two statements are logically equivalent.\n\n4. In our case, we're starting with \"If A, then not B\". The contrapositive of this would be \"If B, then not A\".\n\n5. Therefore, the statement \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\" is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and is logically equivalent to it.\n\n6. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the proposed statement from the given one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
