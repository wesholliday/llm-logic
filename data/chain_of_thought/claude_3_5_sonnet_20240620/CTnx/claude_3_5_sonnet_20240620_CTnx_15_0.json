            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where A is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and B is \"the dreb was spened\"\n\n2. This statement is a conditional statement in the form of \"If P, then Q\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer \"If B, then not A\" from this statement\n\n4. In logic, this transformation is known as the contrapositive of the original statement\n\n5. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\n6. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning they imply each other\n\n7. In our case:\n   Original: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\"\n   Contrapositive: \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\"\n\n8. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer it from the given statement\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
