            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where:\n   A = \"the smip was shripped\"\n   B = \"the smip lupped the zoint\"\n\n2. The statement we're trying to infer has the structure:\n   \"If B, then not A\"\n\n3. This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent of the original statement and switching their positions.\n\n6. Let's apply this to our original statement:\n   Original: \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint\"\n   Contrapositive: \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\"\n\n7. As we can see, the statement we're trying to infer is indeed the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\n8. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer this new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
