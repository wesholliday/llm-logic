            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where A is \"the clug was fleeked\" and B is \"the clug snugged\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If B, then not A\"\n\n3. This is a form of logical contraposition. In formal logic, the contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". These two statements are logically equivalent.\n\n4. However, our original statement is \"If A, then not B\". To get the contrapositive, we need to negate both parts:\n   - \"not (not B)\" becomes simply \"B\"\n   - \"not A\" remains \"not A\"\n\n5. So, the contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is indeed \"If B, then not A\"\n\n6. Therefore, \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" is logically equivalent to the original statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged\"\n\n7. Since these statements are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: yes"
