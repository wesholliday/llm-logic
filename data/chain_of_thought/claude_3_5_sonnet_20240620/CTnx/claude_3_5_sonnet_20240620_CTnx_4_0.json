            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the original statement:\n   \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\"\n\n2. We can represent this statement logically as:\n   If A, then not B\n   Where A = \"the fribble was snurgled\" and B = \"the fribble crink\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\"\n   Which can be represented as:\n   If B, then not A\n\n4. This inference is actually the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. To understand why, let's consider the possibilities:\n   - If the original statement is true and the fribble was snurgled, it must not have crink.\n   - Therefore, if the fribble did crink, it couldn't have been snurgled, because that would contradict the original statement.\n\n6. Another way to think about it:\n   - The original statement rules out the possibility of something being both snurgled and crink.\n   - So if something did crink, it must not have been snurgled.\n\n7. This relationship always holds true for statements in the form \"If A, then B\" and their contrapositive \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the given statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
