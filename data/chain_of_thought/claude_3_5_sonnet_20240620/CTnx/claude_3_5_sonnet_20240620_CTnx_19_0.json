            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where A is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and B is \"the smonk plagged\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If B, then not A\"\n\n3. This is a form of logical contraposition. In formal logic, the contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\", and these are logically equivalent.\n\n4. However, our original statement is \"If A, then not B\", not \"If A, then B\"\n\n5. The contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" would be \"If B, then not A\"\n\n6. This is exactly the form of the statement we're asked about in the question.\n\n7. Therefore, the statement \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and can be logically inferred from it.\n\n8. It's important to note that even though we don't know what \"smonk\", \"vreebled\", or \"plagged\" mean, the logical relationship between these concepts remains valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
