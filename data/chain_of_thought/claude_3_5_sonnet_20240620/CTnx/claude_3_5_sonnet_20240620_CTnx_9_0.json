First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished\"\n   This is in the form: If P, then not Q\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer:\n   \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\"\n   This is in the form: If Q, then not P\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. To form the contrapositive:\n   - We negate both parts of the original statement\n   - We reverse the order\n\n5. Let's apply this to our original statement:\n   Original: If P, then not Q\n   Contrapositive: If Q, then not P\n\n6. We can see that the statement we're asked about matches the structure of the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer this new statement from the original one.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the original statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
