            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the given statement: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\n2. This statement is in the form of a conditional: If A, then not B. Where A is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and B is \"the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer the contrapositive of this statement. The contrapositive of \"If A, then not B\" is \"If B, then not A.\"\n\n4. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n5. Therefore, if \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" is true, then \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" must also be true.\n\n6. This inference is valid regardless of whether zingers, fraggling, or smoogling actually exist or what they might mean. The logical relationship holds based on the structure of the statements alone.\n\nAnswer: yes"
