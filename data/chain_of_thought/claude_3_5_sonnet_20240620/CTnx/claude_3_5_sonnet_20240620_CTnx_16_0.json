            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where:\n   A = \"the sneg was crampled\"\n   B = \"the sneg sproted the frink\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If B, then not A\"\n\n3. This is a form of logical contraposition. In formal logic, the contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". These two statements are logically equivalent.\n\n4. In our case, we're starting with \"If A, then not B\". The contrapositive of this would be \"If B, then not A\".\n\n5. Therefore, the statement \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\" is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement and is logically equivalent to it.\n\n6. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer this new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
