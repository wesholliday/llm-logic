            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then not B\" where A is \"the flob was skizzled\" and B is \"the flob movated\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If B, then not A\"\n\n3. This is a form of logical contraposition. In formal logic, the contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". These two statements are logically equivalent.\n\n4. In our case, we're starting with \"If A, then not B\". The contrapositive of this would be \"If B, then not A\".\n\n5. Therefore, the statement \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" is indeed the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n6. Since a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, we can infer one from the other.\n\n7. This means that \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" can be validly inferred from \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob did not movated\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
