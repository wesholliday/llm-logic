            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the given statement: \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was not zimmed.\"\n\n2. This statement is in the form of a conditional: If A, then B. Where:\n   A = \"the flug was blummed\"\n   B = \"the flug was not zimmed\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the flug was zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\"\n\n4. This proposed inference is the contrapositive of the original statement. In logic, the contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n5. In our case:\n   Not B = \"the flug was zimmed\" (opposite of \"not zimmed\")\n   Not A = \"the flug was not blummed\"\n\n6. In propositional logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n7. Therefore, from the original statement, we can indeed infer its contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes"
