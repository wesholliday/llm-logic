            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement has two parts connected by \"and\":\n   a) \"The software must have been updated\"\n   b) \"it must have been restarted\"\n\n2. Both parts use the phrase \"must have been,\" which indicates a strong belief or logical necessity about past events.\n\n3. The word \"it\" in the second part clearly refers to \"the software\" from the first part.\n\n4. The proposed inference combines these two actions into a single phrase: \"updated and restarted.\"\n\n5. This combination does not change the meaning of the original statement. It simply expresses the same two actions more concisely.\n\n6. The use of \"must have been\" is preserved in the inference, maintaining the same level of certainty or logical necessity.\n\n7. The order of the actions (updated, then restarted) is maintained in both the original statement and the inference.\n\n8. No additional information is added or removed in the inference; it's merely a more compact way of expressing the same idea.\n\nGiven these points, we can conclude that the inference is logically equivalent to the original statement. It preserves all the essential information and implications of the original, just in a more concise form.\n\nAnswer: yes"
