            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement has two parts connected by \"and\":\n   a) \"The application must have been completed online\"\n   b) \"it must have included references\"\n\n2. Both parts are preceded by \"must have,\" indicating that both conditions are necessary.\n\n3. The inferred statement also has two parts:\n   a) \"The application must have been completed online\"\n   b) \"included references\"\n\n4. The first part of both statements is identical, so there's no change there.\n\n5. In the second part, the inferred statement removes \"it must have\" before \"included references.\"\n\n6. By removing \"must have\" from the second part, we might be slightly weakening the emphasis on the necessity of including references. However, since the statement still uses \"must\" at the beginning and the two parts are connected by \"and,\" it can be understood that both conditions are still required.\n\n7. The meaning of the inferred statement is essentially the same as the original statement, just with slightly more concise wording.\n\n8. The removal of \"it must have\" does not change the core meaning or requirements expressed in the statement.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the inferred statement conveys the same meaning as the original statement, just in a more concise form.\n\nAnswer: yes"
