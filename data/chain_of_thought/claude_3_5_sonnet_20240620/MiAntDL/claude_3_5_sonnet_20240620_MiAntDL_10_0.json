            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The document might be signed or notarized.\"\n2. This statement uses the word \"or,\" which indicates that either one or both of these conditions could be true.\n3. The two possibilities mentioned are:\n   a) The document might be signed\n   b) The document might be notarized\n4. The question asks if we can infer \"The document might be signed\" from the original statement.\n5. Since the original statement explicitly includes \"signed\" as one of the possibilities, we can directly infer that the document might indeed be signed.\n6. The presence of \"or notarized\" doesn't negate or contradict the possibility of the document being signed; it simply provides an additional possibility.\n7. Therefore, the inference \"The document might be signed\" is a valid and direct conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
