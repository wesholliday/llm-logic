This statement presents two possibilities for the movie:\n   a) It might be in English\n   b) It might be subtitled\n\n3. The word \"or\" indicates that either one or both of these possibilities could be true.\n\n4. The question asks if we can infer \"The movie might be in English\" from the original statement.\n\n5. Since \"The movie might be in English\" is explicitly stated as one of the possibilities in the original statement, we can indeed infer this.\n\n6. The original statement does not exclude the possibility of the movie being in English; in fact, it directly mentions it as a potential option.\n\n7. Therefore, inferring that \"The movie might be in English\" is a valid and direct conclusion from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
