            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The application might be completed online or in person.\"\n\n2. This statement presents two possible options for completing the application: online or in person.\n\n3. The word \"or\" indicates that either of these options is possible.\n\n4. The statement we're trying to infer is \"The application might be completed online.\"\n\n5. This inferred statement is focusing on just one of the two options presented in the original statement.\n\n6. The original statement explicitly includes \"online\" as one of the possibilities.\n\n7. The use of \"might\" in both statements preserves the element of possibility rather than certainty.\n\n8. By selecting only the \"online\" option from the original statement, we're not contradicting or extending beyond what was initially stated.\n\n9. We're simply isolating one of the explicitly mentioned possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The application might be completed online\" is a valid inference from the original statement, as it's directly supported by the information given and doesn't introduce any new or conflicting information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
