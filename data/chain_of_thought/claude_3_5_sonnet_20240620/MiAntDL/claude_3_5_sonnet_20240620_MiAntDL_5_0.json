            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow.\"\n2. This statement presents two possibilities for delivery: today or tomorrow.\n3. The word \"might\" indicates uncertainty and suggests that either of these options is possible.\n4. The statement we're trying to infer is \"The package might be delivered today.\"\n5. This inferred statement focuses only on the possibility of delivery today.\n6. Since the original statement includes today as one of the possible delivery times, and uses \"might\" to indicate uncertainty, it does allow for the possibility of delivery today.\n7. The inferred statement doesn't contradict or extend beyond the possibilities presented in the original statement; it merely focuses on one of the given options.\n8. Importantly, the inferred statement maintains the uncertainty (\"might\") present in the original statement.\n9. Therefore, the inferred statement is a logical subset of the information provided in the original statement.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that the inferred statement is supported by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
