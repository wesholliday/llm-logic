            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The meeting might be at 2 PM or cancelled.\"\n2. This statement presents two possibilities: \n   a) The meeting might be at 2 PM\n   b) The meeting might be cancelled\n\n3. The word \"or\" indicates that either of these possibilities could be true.\n4. The question asks if we can infer \"The meeting might be at 2 PM\" from the original statement.\n5. Since the original statement explicitly includes \"The meeting might be at 2 PM\" as one of the possibilities, we can indeed infer this.\n6. The fact that there's another possibility (cancellation) doesn't negate the possibility of the 2 PM meeting.\n7. The word \"might\" in both statements indicates uncertainty, which is consistent between the original statement and the inference.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"The meeting might be at 2 PM\" from the original statement, as it's directly stated as one of the possibilities.\n\nAnswer: yes"
