            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\"\n   b) \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of these two conditions must be true:\n   - The keys are dangling in the cabinet\n   - The keys are in the drawer\n\n3. Statement (a) directly negates the first part of the disjunction in statement (b). It tells us that \"The keys are dangling in the cabinet\" is false.\n\n4. In a logical disjunction, if one part is false, the other part must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n5. Since we know that \"The keys are dangling in the cabinet\" is false, and the disjunction must be true (as stated in the original premise), we can conclude that the other part of the disjunction must be true.\n\n6. Therefore, \"The keys are in the drawer\" must be true.\n\nThis is a classic example of a logical inference using disjunctive syllogism: when presented with an OR statement and the negation of one of its parts, we can infer that the other part must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
