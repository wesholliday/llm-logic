            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\"\n   b) \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true:\n   - The sunglasses are perched on her head\n   - The sunglasses are in her bag\n\n3. Statement (a) explicitly tells us that the sunglasses are not perched on her head. This eliminates the first option in the disjunction.\n\n4. Since we know that one of the two options in statement (b) must be true, and we've eliminated the first option, we can conclude that the second option must be true.\n\n5. Therefore, if the sunglasses are not perched on her head, and they must be either on her head or in her bag, then they must be in her bag.\n\nThis is a classic example of logical deduction using the process of elimination.\n\nAnswer: yes"
