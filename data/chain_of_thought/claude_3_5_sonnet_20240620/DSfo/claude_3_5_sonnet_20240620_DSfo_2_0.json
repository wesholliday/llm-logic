            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"The book isn't resting on the table\"\n   b) \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that one of the two options must be true:\n   - The book is resting on the table\n   OR\n   - The book is on the shelf\n\n3. Statement (a) explicitly tells us that the book is not resting on the table. This eliminates the first option in the disjunction.\n\n4. Since we know that one of the two options in statement (b) must be true, and we've eliminated the first option, we can conclude that the second option must be true.\n\n5. Therefore, if the book is not on the table, and it must be either on the table or on the shelf, then it must be on the shelf.\n\nThis is an example of a logical inference called \"disjunctive syllogism\" or \"process of elimination.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
