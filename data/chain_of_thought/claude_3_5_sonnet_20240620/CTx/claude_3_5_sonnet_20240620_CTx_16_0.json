            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where:\n   A = \"the sneg was crampled\"\n   B = \"the sneg sproted the frink\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. In formal logic, the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n5. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n6. In this case:\n   Original: \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\"\n   Contrapositive: \"If the sneg did not sproted the frink, then the sneg was not crampled\"\n\n7. As we can see, the statement in the question is indeed the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\n8. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer this new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
