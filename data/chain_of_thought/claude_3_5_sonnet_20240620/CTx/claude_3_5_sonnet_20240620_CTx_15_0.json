            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the dreb was vroombed\" and B is \"the dreb was spened\"\n\n2. The question is asking if we can infer:\n   \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n3. This type of logical inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. In formal logic, the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n5. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n6. In this case:\n   Original: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened\"\n   Contrapositive: \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\"\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the given conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
