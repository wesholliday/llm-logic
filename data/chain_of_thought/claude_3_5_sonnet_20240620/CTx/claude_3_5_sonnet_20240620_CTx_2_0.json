            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where:\n   A = \"the wug was flooped\"\n   B = \"the wug bimmed the zoint\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n5. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n6. In this case:\n   Original: \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\"\n   Contrapositive: \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped\"\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the given conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
