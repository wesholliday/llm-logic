            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the shank was plooked\" and B is \"the shank was nugged\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. In formal logic, the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n5. To understand this, let's consider the possibilities:\n   - If the original statement is true and the shank is plooked, it must be nugged.\n   - Therefore, if the shank is not nugged, it cannot have been plooked, because if it had been plooked, it would have been nugged.\n\n6. This relationship holds regardless of the specific meanings of \"plooked\" and \"nugged\" - it's based purely on the logical structure of the statement.\n\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
