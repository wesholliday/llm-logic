            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and B is \"the smonk plagged\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If not B, then not A\"\n   This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n4. To illustrate this:\n   - If the original statement is true, and A is true, then B must be true.\n   - If B is false, then A cannot be true (because if A were true, B would have to be true).\n   - Therefore, if B is false, A must be false.\n\n5. This relationship holds regardless of the specific meanings of A and B. It's purely based on the logical structure of the statement.\n\n6. In this case:\n   Original: \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\"\n   Contrapositive: \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\"\n\n7. These two statements are logically equivalent, even though we don't know what \"smonk\", \"vreebled\", or \"plagged\" actually mean.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the given statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
