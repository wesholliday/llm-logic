            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\"\n   This is in the form: If A, then B\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked\"\n   This is in the form: If not B, then not A\n\n3. In logic, this transformation is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n5. To illustrate:\n   Original: If A, then B\n   Contrapositive: If not B, then not A\n\n6. In our case:\n   Original: If the whiffle was shanked (A), then the whiffle tinked (B)\n   Contrapositive: If the whiffle did not tink (not B), then the whiffle was not shanked (not A)\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the given conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
