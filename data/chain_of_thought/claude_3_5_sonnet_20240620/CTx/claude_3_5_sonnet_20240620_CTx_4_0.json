            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and B is \"the fribble crinked\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If not B, then not A\" where not B is \"the fribble did not crink\" and not A is \"the fribble was not snurgled\"\n\n3. This type of logical inference is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n4. In formal logic, the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n5. Therefore, from the given statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\", we can indeed logically infer \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\"\n\n6. It's important to note that while the terms \"fribble\", \"snurgled\", and \"crinked\" are nonsense words, the logical structure remains valid regardless of the specific content.\n\nAnswer: yes"
