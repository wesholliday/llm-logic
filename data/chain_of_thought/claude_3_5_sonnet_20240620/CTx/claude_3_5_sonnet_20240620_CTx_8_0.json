            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and B is \"the sprocket was daggled\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. In formal logic, the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n5. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n6. In this case:\n   Original: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\"\n   Contrapositive: \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked\"\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the given conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
