            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the flob was skizzled\" and B is \"the flob movated\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n6. So, if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n7. In this case:\n   Original: \"If the flob was skizzled, then the flob movated\"\n   Contrapositive: \"If the flob did not movate, then the flob was not skizzled\"\n\n8. The statement in the question matches the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the statement in the question from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
