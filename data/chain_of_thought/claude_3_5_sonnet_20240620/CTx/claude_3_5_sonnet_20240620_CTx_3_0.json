            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\"\n   This is in the form: If A, then B\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\"\n   This is in the form: If not B, then not A\n\n3. In logic, this transformation is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n4. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n5. Let's break it down:\n   - Original: If (splat was morphed), then (splat quanked)\n   - Contrapositive: If (splat did not quank), then (splat was not morphed)\n\n6. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nTherefore, based on this logical analysis, we can conclude that the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
