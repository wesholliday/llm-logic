            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and B is \"it surned\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If not B, then not A\" where not B is \"the fleeg did not surn\" and not A is \"the fleeg was not bluttered\"\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. The contrapositive is formed by negating both the antecedent and the consequent of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n6. In this case:\n   Original: If A, then B\n   Contrapositive: If not B, then not A\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered\" from the original statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
