            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\"\n   This is in the form: If A, then B\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\"\n   This is in the form: If not B, then not A\n\n3. In logic, this transformation is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n4. A key principle in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. They always have the same truth value.\n\n5. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n6. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" is indeed \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\".\n\n7. Therefore, we can validly infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
