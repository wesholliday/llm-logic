            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where:\n   A = \"the smip was shripped\"\n   B = \"the smip lupped the zoint\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If not B, then not A\" where:\n   not B = \"the smip did not lup the zoint\"\n   not A = \"the smip was not shripped\"\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n5. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n6. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" is indeed \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\".\n\n7. Therefore, we can validly infer the given conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
