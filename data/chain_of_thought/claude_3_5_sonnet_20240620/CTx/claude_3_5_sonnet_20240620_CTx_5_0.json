            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and B is \"the zinger was smoogled\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If not B, then not A\" where not B is \"the zinger was not smoogled\" and not A is \"the zinger was not fraggled\"\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n6. Let's apply this to our original statement:\n   Original: If A, then B\n   Contrapositive: If not B, then not A\n\n7. We can see that the statement we're asked about matches the structure of the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n8. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer this new statement from the original one.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" from the original statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
