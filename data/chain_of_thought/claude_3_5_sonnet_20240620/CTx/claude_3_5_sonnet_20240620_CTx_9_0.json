First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\"\n   This is in the form: If P, then Q\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer:\n   \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\"\n   This is in the form: If not Q, then not P\n\n3. In logic, this transformation is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n5. To illustrate:\n   Original: If P, then Q\n   Contrapositive: If not Q, then not P\n\n6. In our specific case:\n   Original: If (twonk was plinked), then (it was varnished)\n   Contrapositive: If (twonk was not varnished), then (it was not plinked)\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the given conclusion from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
