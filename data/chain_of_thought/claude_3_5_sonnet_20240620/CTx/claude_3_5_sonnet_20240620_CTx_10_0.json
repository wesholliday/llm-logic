            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the wug was sproinged\" and B is \"it was garpled\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If not B, then not A\"\n   This is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n3. In formal logic, the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n4. To understand this intuitively:\n   - If the original statement is true, and we know that B did not happen, then A could not have happened either. Because if A had happened, B would have followed.\n\n5. Let's apply this to our specific example:\n   - Original: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\"\n   - Contrapositive: \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged\"\n\n6. These two statements are logically equivalent. If we accept the truth of the first, we must accept the truth of the second.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
