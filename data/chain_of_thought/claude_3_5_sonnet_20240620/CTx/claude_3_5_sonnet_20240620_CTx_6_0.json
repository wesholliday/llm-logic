            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where:\n   A = \"the grommet was sploffed\"\n   B = \"the grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If not B, then not A\" where:\n   not B = \"the grommet did not plop the frink\"\n   not A = \"the grommet was not sploffed\"\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement and is always true if the original statement is true.\n\n4. To form the contrapositive:\n   - We negate both parts of the original statement\n   - We reverse the order of the parts\n\n5. So, from \"If A, then B\", the contrapositive is \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n6. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\" is indeed \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed\"\n\n7. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer it from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
