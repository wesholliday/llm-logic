            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where A is \"the clug was fleeked\" and B is \"the clug snugged\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n6. In this case:\n   Original: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\"\n   Contrapositive: \"If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked\"\n\n7. The contrapositive is always a valid inference from the original statement.\n\n8. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"If the clug did not snug, then the clug was not fleeked\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
