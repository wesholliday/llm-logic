            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B is true (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n4. In logic, we cannot conclude that A is true just because B is true in a conditional statement. This is because the conditional only states that B must be true if A is true, but it doesn't say anything about A when B is true.\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider the following example:\n   \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n   If we know the ground is wet, we can't necessarily conclude that it's raining. The ground could be wet for other reasons (like a sprinkler).\n\n6. Similarly, in our case, Mark could have bought the blue shirt for reasons unrelated to Lisa buying the red shirt.\n\n7. This type of logical error is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent.\n\nTherefore, while we know that Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot necessarily conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
