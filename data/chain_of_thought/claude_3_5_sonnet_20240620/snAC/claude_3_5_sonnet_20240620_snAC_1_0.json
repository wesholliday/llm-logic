            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". This means that if the antecedent (A) is true, the consequent (B) must be true. However, it doesn't necessarily work in reverse.\n\n3. We know that Sue was at the wedding (statement b). This confirms the consequent of the conditional statement.\n\n4. However, confirming the consequent doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent is true. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\".\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider the following example:\n   If it's raining, the grass is wet.\n   The grass is wet.\n   Does this necessarily mean it's raining? No, because the grass could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, dew, etc.).\n\n6. Similarly, in our case, Sue could have been at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's presence. The conditional statement only tells us that Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence, not the other way around.\n\n7. Therefore, while it's possible that Mary was at the wedding, we cannot conclude this with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
