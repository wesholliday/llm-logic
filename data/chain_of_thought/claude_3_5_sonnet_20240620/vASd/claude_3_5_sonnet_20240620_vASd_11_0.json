            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the premise and conclusion:\n   Premise: If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\n   Conclusion: If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\n\n2. The premise is a simple conditional statement: If A, then B.\n   A = getting enough sleep\n   B = not being tired\n\n3. The conclusion is a more complex conditional statement: If (A and C), then B.\n   A = getting enough sleep\n   C = doing hard labor\n   B = not being tired\n\n4. The argument is adding an additional condition (doing hard labor) to the antecedent of the conditional statement, while keeping the consequent the same.\n\n5. This form of argument is known as \"strengthening the antecedent\" or \"adding a conjunct to the antecedent.\"\n\n6. In formal logic, this type of inference is not valid. Just because something is true under one condition doesn't mean it will still be true when an additional condition is added.\n\n7. In this specific case, while getting enough sleep might prevent tiredness under normal circumstances, the addition of hard labor could potentially cause tiredness even if one has had enough sleep.\n\n8. The conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise. There could be situations where the premise is true (getting enough sleep prevents tiredness) but the conclusion is false (getting enough sleep doesn't prevent tiredness when combined with hard labor).\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
