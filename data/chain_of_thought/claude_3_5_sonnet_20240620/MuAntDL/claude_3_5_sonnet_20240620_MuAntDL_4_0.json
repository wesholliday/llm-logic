            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled.\"\n\n2. This statement presents two possibilities:\n   a) The meeting was at 2 PM\n   b) The meeting was cancelled\n\n3. The word \"or\" indicates that either of these possibilities could be true, but not necessarily both.\n\n4. The question asks if we can infer that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM.\"\n\n5. To infer this, we would need to be certain that the meeting was at 2 PM and not cancelled.\n\n6. However, the original statement doesn't provide enough information to eliminate the possibility that the meeting was cancelled.\n\n7. Without additional information, we cannot rule out the cancellation option.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the meeting must have been at 2 PM.\n\n9. The original statement allows for both possibilities, while the inference eliminates one of those possibilities without justification.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot make the inference that \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM\" based solely on the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
