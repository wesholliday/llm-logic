            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement says \"The event must have been formal or semi-formal.\"\n2. This statement presents two possibilities: formal OR semi-formal.\n3. The word \"or\" indicates that either of these options could be true, but not necessarily both.\n4. The question asks if we can infer that \"The event must have been formal.\"\n5. To infer this, we would need to be certain that the event was formal, eliminating the semi-formal possibility.\n6. However, the original statement doesn't provide any information that would allow us to rule out the semi-formal option.\n7. The event could have been formal, but it also could have been semi-formal based on the given information.\n8. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the event must have been formal.\n9. Inferring that it must have been formal would be an unjustified narrowing of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
