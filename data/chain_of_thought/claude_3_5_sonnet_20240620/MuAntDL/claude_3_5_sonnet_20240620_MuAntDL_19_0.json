            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement says \"The application must have been completed online or in person.\"\n2. This statement presents two possible options for completing the application: online OR in person.\n3. The word \"or\" indicates that either of these options is acceptable, but not necessarily both.\n4. The statement we're asked to infer is \"The application must have been completed online.\"\n5. This inferred statement eliminates the \"in person\" option entirely.\n6. By removing one of the original options, we're making the statement more restrictive than the original.\n7. The original statement allows for the possibility of completing the application in person, which the inferred statement does not.\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that the application must have been completed online based solely on the given information.\n9. The inferred statement is more specific and narrow than what we can definitively conclude from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
