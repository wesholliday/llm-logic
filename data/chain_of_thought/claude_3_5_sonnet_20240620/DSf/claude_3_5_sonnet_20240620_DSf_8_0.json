            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"Either the remote control is hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\"\n   b) \"The remote control isn't hiding under the couch\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true:\n   - The remote is under the couch, OR\n   - The remote is on the coffee table\n\n3. The second statement directly eliminates the first option from the disjunction. It explicitly states that the remote is not under the couch.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a disjunction (A or B) and we know that one of the options (A) is false, we can conclude that the other option (B) must be true. This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   - We know the remote is either under the couch OR on the coffee table\n   - We know it's not under the couch\n   - Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that it's on the coffee table\n\n6. There are no other options presented in the original statement, so we don't need to consider any other possibilities.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
