            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with two pieces of information:\n   a) \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag\"\n   b) \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true, and possibly both could be true.\n\n3. However, the second statement eliminates one of these possibilities. We're told that the sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n\n4. In logic, this type of reasoning is called disjunctive syllogism. When we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n5. Since we know the sunglasses are not on her head, and we were told they must be either on her head OR in her bag, we can logically conclude that they must be in her bag.\n\n6. There are no other possibilities presented in the given information, so we don't need to consider any other options.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: yes"
