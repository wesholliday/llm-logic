            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1. We start with two pieces of information:\n   a) \"Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway\"\n   b) \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It tells us that one of these two options must be true:\n   - The newspaper is on the porch\n   - The newspaper is in the driveway\n\n3. The second statement directly eliminates one of these options. It tells us that the newspaper is not on the porch.\n\n4. In logic, this type of reasoning is known as disjunctive syllogism. When we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n5. Since we know the newspaper is not on the porch, and it must be either on the porch or in the driveway, we can logically conclude that it must be in the driveway.\n\n6. There are no other possibilities given in the original statement, so we don't need to consider any other locations for the newspaper.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The newspaper is in the driveway.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
