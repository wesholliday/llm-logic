            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either Fido is in the garden or Fido is inside\"\n   b) \"Fido is not in the garden\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true: Fido is in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n\n3. The second statement explicitly tells us that Fido is not in the garden.\n\n4. Given that the first statement says Fido must be in one of two places, and the second statement eliminates one of those places, we can logically conclude that Fido must be in the remaining place.\n\n5. This is an application of a logical rule called \"disjunctive syllogism\" or sometimes \"process of elimination.\" If we know that A or B must be true, and we also know that A is false, then B must be true.\n\n6. Therefore, since we know Fido is either in the garden or inside, and we know Fido is not in the garden, we can logically infer that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: yes"
