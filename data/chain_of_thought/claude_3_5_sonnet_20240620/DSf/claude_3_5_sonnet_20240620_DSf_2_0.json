            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf\"\n   b) \"The book isn't resting on the table\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true: the book is either on the table OR on the shelf (or possibly both, in the case of an inclusive OR).\n\n3. The second statement explicitly negates one of the options from the first statement. It tells us that the book is NOT on the table.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as disjunctive syllogism. When we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n\n5. Since we know the book is not on the table, and it must be either on the table or on the shelf, we can logically conclude that it must be on the shelf.\n\n6. This inference is valid assuming that the initial statements are true and that there are no other possible locations for the book besides the table and the shelf.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The book is on the shelf\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
