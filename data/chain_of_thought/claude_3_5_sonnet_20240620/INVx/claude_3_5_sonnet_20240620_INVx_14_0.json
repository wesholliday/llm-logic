            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n4. However, it's important to note that we can't automatically infer the inverse (If not A, then not B) from a conditional statement (If A, then B). This would be a logical fallacy.\n\n5. In this case, we're specifically asked about the contrapositive, not the inverse.\n\n6. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer it from the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged\" from the original statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
