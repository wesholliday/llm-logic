            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn.\" This is the contrapositive of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n4. However, it's important to note that the original statement does not tell us what happens if the fleeg is not bluttered. It only tells us what happens when it is bluttered.\n\n5. The original statement allows for the possibility that the fleeg could surn even if it wasn't bluttered. In other words, being bluttered is a sufficient condition for surning, but we don't know if it's a necessary condition.\n\n6. Therefore, while the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we cannot infer it from the information given. We would need additional information to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
