            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled.\"\n   This is the contrapositive of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a true statement is always true. The contrapositive is formed by negating both parts of the original statement and reversing their order.\n\n4. However, we need to be careful here. The question is asking if we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement, not if the contrapositive is true when the original statement is true.\n\n5. In formal logic, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n6. This means that if we accept the truth of \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled,\" we must also accept the truth of \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically infer the given statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
