            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n   This is the contrapositive of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. This means that if one is true, the other must also be true.\n\n4. However, the question is asking if we can infer the contrapositive from the original statement. Inference implies deriving a conclusion from given information.\n\n5. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer it from the original statement.\n\n6. It's important to note that this is different from the inverse (\"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\") or the converse (\"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled\"), which are not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer the given statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
