The original statement is: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\n   This is the contrapositive of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. They always have the same truth value.\n\n4. However, the contrapositive is different from the inverse (\"If not A, then not B\") or the converse (\"If B, then A\") of a statement. These are not necessarily true when the original statement is true.\n\n5. In this case, we're specifically asked about the contrapositive.\n\n6. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer it from the original statement.\n\n7. Therefore, from \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled,\" we can logically infer \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
