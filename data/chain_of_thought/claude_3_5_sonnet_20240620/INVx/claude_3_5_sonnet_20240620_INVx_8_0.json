            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, we cannot automatically infer the inverse from a conditional statement. This is a common logical fallacy known as the \"inverse error.\"\n\n4. To illustrate why this inference is not valid, let's consider some possibilities:\n   - The sprocket could be daggled by means other than cranking.\n   - Daggling might occur independently of cranking.\n\n5. The original statement only tells us what happens when the sprocket is cranked. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the sprocket is not cranked.\n\n6. The only valid inference we can make from \"If A, then B\" is its contrapositive: \"If not B, then not A.\" In this case, that would be \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the given statement from the original premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
