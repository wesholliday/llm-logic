The original statement is: \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. To illustrate this, let's use a real-world example:\n   Original: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n   Inverse: \"If it's not raining, then the ground is not wet.\"\n   The inverse isn't necessarily true because the ground could be wet for other reasons (like a sprinkler).\n\n5. Similarly, in our case, even if it's true that a slogged glip is always tragged, we can't conclude that a non-slogged glip is never tragged. There might be other conditions that could cause a glip to be tragged.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us what happens when the glip is slogged, it doesn't give us any information about what happens when the glip is not slogged.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
