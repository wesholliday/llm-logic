            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank.\" This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, we cannot automatically infer the inverse from a conditional statement. This is a common logical fallacy known as the fallacy of the inverse.\n\n4. To illustrate why this inference is not valid, let's use a real-world example:\n   Original statement: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n   Inverse: \"If it's not raining, then the ground is not wet.\"\n   The inverse is clearly not always true, as the ground could be wet for other reasons (like a sprinkler).\n\n5. Returning to our splat example, while we know that if the splat was morphed, it quanked, we don't know anything about what happens when the splat is not morphed. It's possible that splats can quank for reasons other than being morphed.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the given statement from the original premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
