            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. To illustrate this, let's use a real-world example:\n   Original: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n   Inverse: \"If it's not raining, then the ground is not wet.\"\n   The inverse isn't necessarily true because the ground could be wet for other reasons (like a sprinkler).\n\n5. Similarly, in our case, even if the shank wasn't plooked, it could still be nugged for other reasons not mentioned in the original statement.\n\n6. The only valid inference we can make from \"If P, then Q\" is its contrapositive: \"If not Q, then not P.\" In this case, that would be \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the given statement from the original premise.\n\nAnswer: no"
