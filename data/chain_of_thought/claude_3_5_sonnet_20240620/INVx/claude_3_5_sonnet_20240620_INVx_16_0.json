            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where:\n   A = \"the sneg was crampled\"\n   B = \"the sneg sproted the frink\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If not A, then not B\" which would be:\n   \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink\"\n\n3. This type of inference is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\n4. In formal logic, the inverse of a statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n5. Consider this example:\n   Original: \"If it's raining, the ground is wet.\"\n   Inverse: \"If it's not raining, the ground is not wet.\"\n   The inverse isn't necessarily true because the ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n6. The same principle applies to our statement about the sneg. Just because the sneg sprots the frink when crampled, doesn't mean it can't sprot the frink when not crampled.\n\n7. There could be other conditions under which the sneg sprots the frink, even when it's not crampled.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
