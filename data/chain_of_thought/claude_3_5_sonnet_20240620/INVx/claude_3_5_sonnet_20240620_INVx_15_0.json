            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\" This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, we cannot automatically infer the inverse of a conditional statement from the original statement. The original statement only tells us what happens when the condition is met (when the dreb is vroombed), but it doesn't provide information about what happens when the condition is not met.\n\n4. For example, consider this similar structure: \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\" We cannot conclude from this that \"If it's not raining, then the ground is not wet.\" The ground could be wet for other reasons, like a sprinkler system.\n\n5. Similarly, in our case, the dreb could potentially be spened for reasons other than being vroombed. The original statement doesn't exclude this possibility.\n\n6. Therefore, based solely on the given information, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
