            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". In this case:\n   A = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B is true (Mark bought the blue shirt).\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as the fallacy of affirming the consequent. Just because the consequent (B) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean that the antecedent (A) is true.\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider that there could be other reasons why Mark bought the blue shirt, not necessarily because Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us that IF Lisa bought the red shirt, THEN Mark bought the blue shirt. It doesn't say that Mark buying the blue shirt is ONLY possible if Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n7. Therefore, while we know Mark bought the blue shirt, we cannot logically conclude that Lisa bought the red shirt based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
