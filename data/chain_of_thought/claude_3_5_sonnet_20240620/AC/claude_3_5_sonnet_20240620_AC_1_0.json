            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". In this case:\n   A = Mary was at the wedding\n   B = Sue was at the wedding\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B is true (Sue was indeed at the wedding).\n\n4. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that A is true. The conditional statement only tells us that if A is true, then B must be true. It doesn't work in reverse.\n\n5. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\". Just because the consequent (B) is true, it doesn't mean the antecedent (A) must be true.\n\n6. For example, there could be other reasons why Sue was at the wedding that have nothing to do with Mary's presence.\n\n7. The only valid inference we can make from \"If A, then B\" and \"B is true\" is that A might be true, but we can't say for certain.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
