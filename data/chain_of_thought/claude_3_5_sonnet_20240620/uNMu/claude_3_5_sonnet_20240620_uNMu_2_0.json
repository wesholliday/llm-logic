            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The statement says \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\"\n\n2. This means that it's not a certainty or necessity that the griffin was in the forest.\n\n3. If something is not certain, it implies that there are other possibilities.\n\n4. In this case, the other possibility is that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\n5. The phrase \"might not have been\" indicates a possibility of absence, which is consistent with the original statement's rejection of certainty.\n\n6. By saying it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest, we are opening up the possibility that it might not have been there.\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically infer that the griffin might not have been in the forest, as this is a direct implication of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
