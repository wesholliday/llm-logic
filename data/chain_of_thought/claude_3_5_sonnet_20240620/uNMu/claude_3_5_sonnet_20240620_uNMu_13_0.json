            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The statement says \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\"\n\n2. This means that there is no absolute requirement or certainty that the toy is in the toy box.\n\n3. If it's not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box, then there are other possibilities for its location.\n\n4. The phrase \"not the case that it must be\" implies that while the toy could be in the toy box, it doesn't have to be.\n\n5. This leaves open the possibility that the toy might be somewhere else.\n\n6. If there's a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box, then we can indeed infer that the toy might not be in the toy box.\n\n7. The word \"might\" in the question aligns perfectly with the uncertainty implied by the original statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the toy might not be in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: yes"
