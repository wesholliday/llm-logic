            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The statement says \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n\n2. This means that there's no certainty or necessity that Sue chose pizza.\n\n3. If it's not certain that Sue chose pizza, then there must be a possibility that she chose something else.\n\n4. The possibility of choosing something else is equivalent to saying that she might not have chosen pizza.\n\n5. The phrase \"might not have\" indicates a possibility, not a certainty. It leaves room for both options: she might have chosen pizza, or she might not have.\n\n6. The original statement doesn't rule out pizza entirely; it just removes the certainty of pizza being chosen.\n\n7. Therefore, the statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" is consistent with and can be inferred from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
