            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The statement says \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\"\n2. This means that it's not certain or necessary that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n3. If it's not certain that she bought it, then there's a possibility that she didn't buy it.\n4. The question asks if we can infer that Lisa \"might not have\" bought the red shirt.\n5. \"Might not have\" implies a possibility of not doing something, which aligns with our understanding from steps 2 and 3.\n6. Since it's not necessary that Lisa bought the shirt, it logically follows that there's a possibility she didn't buy it.\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
