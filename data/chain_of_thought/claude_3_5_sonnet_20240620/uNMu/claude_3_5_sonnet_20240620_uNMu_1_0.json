            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The statement says \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\n\n2. This means that Mary's presence at the wedding is not a certainty or a necessity.\n\n3. If something is not certain or necessary, it implies that there's a possibility it didn't happen.\n\n4. In logical terms, we're moving from \"not necessarily true\" to \"possibly false.\"\n\n5. The phrase \"might not have been\" indicates a possibility of absence, which aligns with the original statement's implication.\n\n6. By saying it's not the case that Mary must have been there, we're opening up the possibility that she might not have been there.\n\n7. This inference doesn't state that Mary wasn't at the wedding, only that there's a possibility she wasn't there.\n\n8. The inference \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" is a valid logical conclusion from the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding from the statement that it's not the case that she must have been there.\n\nAnswer: yes"
