            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked about the inverse of this statement: \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n   This would be in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider the possibilities:\n   - Lisa bought the red shirt \u2192 Mark bought the blue shirt (given)\n   - Lisa didn't buy the red shirt \u2192 We don't know about Mark's purchase\n\n5. The original statement doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt. Mark could still have bought the blue shirt for other reasons, or he might not have.\n\n6. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" Just because the consequent (Mark buying the blue shirt) follows from the antecedent (Lisa buying the red shirt), it doesn't mean that the consequent won't occur if the antecedent doesn't.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
