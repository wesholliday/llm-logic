            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given the statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks about the inverse of this statement: \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n   This would be \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider the possibilities:\n   - Mary at wedding \u2192 Sue at wedding (given)\n   - Mary not at wedding \u2192 Sue may or may not be at wedding (unknown)\n\n5. The original statement doesn't provide any information about what happens when Mary is not at the wedding. Sue could still be at the wedding even if Mary isn't there.\n\n6. For example, Sue might attend weddings independently of Mary's attendance, or Sue might have other reasons to be at this particular wedding.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding. This conclusion would be an invalid logical inference.\n\nAnswer: no"
