            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given a conditional statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n\n2. This statement only tells us what happens when the apple is red. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the apple is not red.\n\n3. In logical terms, this is an \"if-then\" statement, which can be written as \"P \u2192 Q\" where P is \"the apple was red\" and Q is \"the banana was yellow.\"\n\n4. The question is asking about the inverse of this statement: \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\" In logical terms, this would be \"\u00acP \u2192 \u00acQ\".\n\n5. In propositional logic, the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement. Just because \"If P, then Q\" is true, it doesn't mean that \"If not P, then not Q\" is also true.\n\n6. For example, consider this statement: \"If it's raining, the ground is wet.\" This doesn't mean that \"If it's not raining, the ground is not wet\" is always true. The ground could be wet for other reasons.\n\n7. Similarly, in our case, even if the apple is not red, the banana could still be yellow. The original statement doesn't exclude this possibility.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: no"
