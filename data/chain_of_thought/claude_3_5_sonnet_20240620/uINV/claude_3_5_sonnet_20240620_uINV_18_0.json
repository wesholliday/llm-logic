            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given a conditional statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n   Let's call \"the doll was plastic\" P, and \"the truck was metal\" Q.\n   So we have: If P, then Q.\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If not P, then not Q.\"\n   This is known as the inverse of the original statement.\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. To illustrate this, let's consider a simple example:\n   \"If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\"\n   This doesn't mean that \"If it's not raining, then the ground is not wet.\"\n   The ground could be wet for other reasons (like a sprinkler).\n\n5. Similarly, in our case, even if the doll is not plastic, the truck could still be metal for reasons unrelated to the doll's material.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us what happens when the doll is plastic. It doesn't give us any information about what happens when the doll is not plastic.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer the inverse statement from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
