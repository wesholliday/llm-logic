            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given a conditional statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n\n2. This statement can be represented logically as: A \u2192 C, where A means \"Alex finished the race\" and C means \"Chris finished the race.\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer the inverse of this statement: \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\" This would be represented as: ~A \u2192 ~C (where ~ means \"not\").\n\n4. In logic, we cannot automatically infer the inverse of a conditional statement. The original statement only tells us what happens if Alex finishes, but it doesn't give us any information about what happens if Alex doesn't finish.\n\n5. For example, it's possible that Chris always finishes the race, regardless of whether Alex finishes or not. This scenario would satisfy the original statement but contradict the inverse.\n\n6. The only valid inference we can make from \"If A, then C\" is its contrapositive: \"If not C, then not A.\" We cannot validly infer either the converse (If C, then A) or the inverse (If not A, then not C).\n\n7. Therefore, based solely on the given information, we cannot logically infer that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: no"
