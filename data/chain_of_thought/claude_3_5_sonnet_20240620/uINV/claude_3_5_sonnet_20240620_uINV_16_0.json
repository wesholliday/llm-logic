            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given a conditional statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer the inverse of this statement: \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of inference is called the \"inverse\" of the original statement.\n\n4. It's important to note that the inverse of a statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n5. The original statement only tells us what happens when the shirt is cotton. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the shirt is not cotton.\n\n6. When the shirt is not cotton, the pants could still be denim, or they could be made of another material. The original statement doesn't exclude these possibilities.\n\n7. To illustrate this, consider a scenario where the shirt is polyester and the pants are denim. This scenario doesn't contradict the original statement, but it would contradict the inverse.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: no"
