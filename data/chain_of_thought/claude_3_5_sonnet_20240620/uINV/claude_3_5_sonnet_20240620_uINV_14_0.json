            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given a conditional statement: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n\n2. This statement can be represented logically as: Bear in cave \u2192 Wolf in den\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer the inverse of this statement: \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\"\n\n4. In logical terms, this would be: Not (Bear in cave) \u2192 Not (Wolf in den)\n\n5. In propositional logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us what happens when the bear is in the cave. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the bear is not in the cave.\n\n7. For example, it's possible that the wolf could be in the den for reasons unrelated to the bear's location.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if the bear is not in the cave, then the wolf is not in the den.\n\n9. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
