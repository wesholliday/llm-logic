            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\" This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, we cannot automatically infer the inverse from a conditional statement. The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\n4. To illustrate this, let's consider some possibilities:\n   - The car could be not red (say, green), and the truck could still be blue.\n   - The car could be not red, and the truck could be not blue (say, yellow).\n\n5. The original statement only tells us what happens when the car is red. It doesn't provide any information about what color the truck is when the car is not red.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that if the car is not red, the truck must not be blue. The truck's color remains unknown in this case.\n\n7. This is an example of the logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
