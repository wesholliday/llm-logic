            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given a conditional statement: \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\n2. This statement can be represented logically as: If A, then B\n   Where A = \"the book was written by James\" and B = \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer: If not A, then not B\n   In other words, \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel.\"\n\n4. This type of inference is called the inverse of the original statement.\n\n5. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n6. Consider these possibilities:\n   - James might write only mystery novels, but other authors could also write mystery novels.\n   - There could be mystery novels written by authors other than James.\n\n7. The original statement doesn't provide any information about books not written by James or about non-mystery novels.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that if a book is not written by James, it must not be a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: no"
