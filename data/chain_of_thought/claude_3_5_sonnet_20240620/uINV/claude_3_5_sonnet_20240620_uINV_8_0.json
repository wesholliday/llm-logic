            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given the statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   B = \"the mummy was awake\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer the inverse of this statement: \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\"\n\n4. In logic, we cannot automatically infer the inverse of a conditional statement. This is a common logical fallacy called \"denying the antecedent.\"\n\n5. The original statement only tells us what happens when the vampire is awake. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the vampire is not awake.\n\n6. The mummy could still be awake even if the vampire is not awake. The original statement doesn't rule out this possibility.\n\n7. To illustrate, consider this similar example: \"If it's raining, the grass is wet.\" We can't conclude that if it's not raining, the grass is not wet. The grass could be wet for other reasons (sprinklers, dew, etc.).\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\nAnswer: no"
