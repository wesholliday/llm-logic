            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given the statement: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"Sam took a plane\"\n   Q = \"Erin took a train\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not P, then not Q\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   - Sam took a plane, so Erin took a train (this fits the original statement)\n   - Sam didn't take a plane, and Erin took a train (this doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   - Sam didn't take a plane, and Erin didn't take a train (this also doesn't contradict the original statement)\n\n5. The original statement only tells us what happens if Sam takes a plane. It doesn't give us any information about what happens if Sam doesn't take a plane.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. Erin might or might not have taken a train regardless of Sam's actions.\n\nAnswer: no"
