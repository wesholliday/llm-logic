            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked about the inverse of this statement: \"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n   This would be in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider the possibilities:\n   - Tom watched football and Jen watched basketball (matches the original statement)\n   - Tom watched football and Jen didn't watch basketball (contradicts the original statement)\n   - Tom didn't watch football and Jen watched basketball (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   - Tom didn't watch football and Jen didn't watch basketball (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n\n5. As we can see, it's possible for Tom not to watch football and Jen to still watch basketball without contradicting the original statement.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us what happens if Tom watches football. It doesn't provide any information about what Jen does when Tom doesn't watch football.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: no"
