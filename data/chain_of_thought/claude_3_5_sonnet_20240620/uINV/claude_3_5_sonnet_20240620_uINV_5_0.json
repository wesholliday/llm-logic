            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given the statement: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider the possibilities:\n   - Jeff played basketball and Amy played tennis (matches the original statement)\n   - Jeff didn't play basketball and Amy played tennis (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   - Jeff didn't play basketball and Amy didn't play tennis (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   - Jeff played basketball and Amy didn't play tennis (this would contradict the original statement)\n\n5. As we can see, it's possible for Jeff not to play basketball and Amy to still play tennis. The original statement doesn't give us any information about what happens when Jeff doesn't play basketball.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: no"
