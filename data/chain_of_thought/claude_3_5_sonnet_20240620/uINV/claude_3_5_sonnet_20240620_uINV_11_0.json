            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\"\n   This is the inverse of the original statement, in the form \"If not A, then not B.\"\n\n3. In logic, the inverse of a conditional statement is not necessarily true just because the original statement is true.\n\n4. Let's consider some possibilities:\n   - The cake could be chocolate and the muffins blueberry (satisfies the original statement)\n   - The cake could be vanilla and the muffins could still be blueberry (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   - The cake could be vanilla and the muffins could be chocolate chip (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n\n5. The original statement only tells us what happens when the cake is chocolate. It doesn't provide any information about what happens when the cake is not chocolate.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that if the cake is not chocolate, the muffins are not blueberry. The muffins could still be blueberry even if the cake is not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: no"
