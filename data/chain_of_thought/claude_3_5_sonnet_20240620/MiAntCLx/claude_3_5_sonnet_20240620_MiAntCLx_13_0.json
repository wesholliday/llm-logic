This statement expresses a possibility, not a certainty.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The grooble might be in shimble and wobble zooble.\"\n4. This new statement includes the original possibility (grooble in shimble) but adds an additional element (wobble zooble).\n5. In logic, we cannot add new information to a statement and still guarantee its truth.\n6. The original statement allows for the possibility that the grooble is in shimble, but says nothing about wobble zooble.\n7. Therefore, while the original statement might be true, we cannot infer the truth of the expanded statement.\n8. The expanded statement is more specific and restrictive than the original, and thus cannot be logically inferred from it.\n\nAnswer: no"
