            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The document might be signed or notarized.\"\n\n2. This statement uses the word \"or,\" which in everyday language can have two interpretations:\n   a) Inclusive OR: meaning one or the other, or possibly both\n   b) Exclusive OR: meaning one or the other, but not both\n\n3. In this case, without additional context, we typically interpret this as an inclusive OR. This means the document could be:\n   - Only signed\n   - Only notarized\n   - Both signed and notarized\n\n4. The proposed inference is \"The document might be signed or it might be notarized.\"\n\n5. This rephrasing maintains the same meaning as the original statement. It still allows for all three possibilities mentioned in point 3.\n\n6. The rephrasing doesn't change the logical content of the statement; it merely restates it in a slightly different way.\n\n7. Both the original statement and the inference express uncertainty (using \"might\") and present the same two possibilities (signed or notarized) without excluding the possibility of both occurring.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the proposed inference is a valid restatement of the original sentence, preserving its meaning and logical implications.\n\nAnswer: yes"
