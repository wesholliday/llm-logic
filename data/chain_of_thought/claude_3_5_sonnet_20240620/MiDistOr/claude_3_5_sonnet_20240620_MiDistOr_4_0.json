            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or be cancelled.\"\n\n2. This statement presents two possibilities connected by \"or\":\n   a) The meeting might start at 2 PM\n   b) The meeting might be cancelled\n\n3. The word \"might\" at the beginning of the sentence applies to both parts of the statement, indicating uncertainty for both possibilities.\n\n4. The proposed inference is \"The meeting might start at 2 PM or it might be cancelled.\"\n\n5. This inference explicitly states \"might\" for both possibilities, making the uncertainty more clear for each option.\n\n6. The meaning of both statements is essentially the same:\n   - Both indicate that there are two possible outcomes for the meeting.\n   - Both express uncertainty about which outcome will occur.\n\n7. The inference simply restates the original sentence in a slightly more explicit way, without changing its fundamental meaning or adding any new information.\n\n8. Therefore, we can safely infer the second statement from the first, as it's just a rephrasing that maintains the original meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
