            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The package might be delivered today or tomorrow.\"\n\n2. This statement expresses uncertainty about the delivery date, indicating two possible outcomes.\n\n3. The word \"might\" in the original statement applies to both \"today\" and \"tomorrow,\" suggesting that either outcome is possible.\n\n4. The inferred statement is \"The package might be delivered today or it might be delivered tomorrow.\"\n\n5. This inferred statement explicitly repeats the word \"might\" for both possible outcomes.\n\n6. By repeating \"might,\" the inferred statement emphasizes the uncertainty for each individual day.\n\n7. However, this repetition does not change the fundamental meaning of the original statement.\n\n8. Both statements convey the same information: there is a possibility of delivery on either of the two days mentioned.\n\n9. The original statement implicitly applies \"might\" to both options, while the inferred statement does so explicitly.\n\n10. There is no loss or addition of information in the inferred statement compared to the original one.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that the inferred statement is a valid interpretation of the original statement, as it maintains the same meaning and level of uncertainty.\n\nAnswer: yes"
