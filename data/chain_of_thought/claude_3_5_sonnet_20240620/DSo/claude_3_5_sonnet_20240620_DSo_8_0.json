            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) The remote control isn't hiding under the couch.\n   b) Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it is hiding under the couch.\n\n2. Statement (b) is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that one of the two options must be true:\n   - The remote control is on the coffee table\n   - The remote control is hiding under the couch\n\n3. Statement (a) explicitly tells us that the remote control is not hiding under the couch. This eliminates the second option in the disjunction.\n\n4. Since we know that one of the options in statement (b) must be true, and we've eliminated one option, the remaining option must be true.\n\n5. The remaining option is \"The remote control is on the coffee table.\"\n\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we can logically conclude that the remote control must be on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: yes"
