            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"The book isn't resting on the table\"\n   b) \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two options must be true:\n   - The book is on the shelf\n   - The book is resting on the table\n\n3. Statement (a) explicitly tells us that the book is not resting on the table. This eliminates the second option in the disjunction.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a disjunction (A OR B) and we know that one of the options (B) is false, we can conclude that the other option (A) must be true. This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\n5. Applying this principle to our scenario:\n   - We know that (book on shelf OR book on table) is true\n   - We also know that (book on table) is false\n   - Therefore, (book on shelf) must be true\n\n6. This logical deduction allows us to conclude that the book must be on the shelf, as it's the only remaining option that satisfies both given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
