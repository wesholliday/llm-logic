            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack.\n   b) Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n\n2. Statement (b) is an \"either-or\" statement, which means one of the two options must be true.\n\n3. The two options in statement (b) are:\n   - The scarf is stuffed in my backpack\n   - The scarf is draped on the coat rack\n\n4. From statement (a), we know that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack.\n\n5. This eliminates the second option in statement (b).\n\n6. Since one of the options in statement (b) must be true, and we've eliminated one option, the remaining option must be true.\n\n7. The remaining option is: The scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the scarf must be stuffed in the backpack.\n\nAnswer: yes"
