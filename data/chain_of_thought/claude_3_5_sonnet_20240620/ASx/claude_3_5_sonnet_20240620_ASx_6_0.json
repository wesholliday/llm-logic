            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If you glurp, it will hurt my snarfs.\"\n2. This is a simple conditional statement: if A occurs, then B will happen.\n3. The statement we're asked to infer is: \"If you glurp and I am wearing plorks, it will hurt my snarfs.\"\n4. This new statement adds an additional condition: wearing plorks.\n5. In logic, this is known as strengthening the antecedent (the \"if\" part of the statement).\n6. When we strengthen the antecedent, the original consequent (the \"then\" part) still holds true.\n7. This is because the original statement doesn't specify any conditions about wearing or not wearing plorks.\n8. The original statement implies that glurping alone is sufficient to hurt snarfs, regardless of any other conditions.\n9. Therefore, adding the condition of wearing plorks doesn't change the outcome of hurting snarfs if glurping occurs.\n10. The new statement is more specific but doesn't contradict the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
