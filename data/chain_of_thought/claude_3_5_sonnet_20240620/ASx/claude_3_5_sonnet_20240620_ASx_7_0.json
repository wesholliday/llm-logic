            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled.\"\n   This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled.\"\n   This is a more complex conditional statement of the form \"If A and C, then B.\"\n\n3. In logic, there's a principle called \"strengthening the antecedent.\" This principle states that if a conditional statement is true, it remains true when you add additional conditions to the antecedent (the \"if\" part).\n\n4. In our case, we're adding the condition \"the plink light is out\" to the original antecedent \"the tizzer is on.\"\n\n5. The consequent (the \"then\" part) remains the same in both statements: \"the goom is snurpled.\"\n\n6. Since the original statement is given as true, and we're only adding an additional condition to the antecedent without changing the consequent, the new statement must also be true.\n\n7. The status of the plink light (whether it's out or not) doesn't affect the relationship between the tizzer being on and the goom being snurpled.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
