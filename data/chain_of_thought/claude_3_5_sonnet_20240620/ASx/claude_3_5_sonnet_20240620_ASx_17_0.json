            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the glop is on the brink, then the skrizzle is plonked.\"\n   This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The proposed inference is: \"If the glop is on the brink and the bloop is zorped, then the skrizzle is plonked.\"\n   This is a more complex conditional statement of the form \"If A and C, then B.\"\n\n3. In logic, there's a principle called \"strengthening the antecedent.\" This principle states that we can add additional conditions to the \"if\" part of a conditional statement without changing the truth of the original statement.\n\n4. In this case, we're adding \"and the bloop is zorped\" to the antecedent (the \"if\" part).\n\n5. The consequent (the \"then\" part) remains unchanged: \"the skrizzle is plonked.\"\n\n6. The new statement is still true because if the original statement is true, then whenever \"the glop is on the brink\" occurs, \"the skrizzle is plonked\" must follow, regardless of any additional conditions (like \"the bloop is zorped\").\n\n7. The additional condition doesn't affect the truth of the original implication; it just narrows the circumstances under which we're considering it.\n\nTherefore, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
