            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the ploofle is blorped, then the fliggle will get a nurple.\"\n\n2. This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the ploofle is blorped and zooned, then the fliggle will get a nurple.\"\n\n4. This new statement is of the form \"If A and C, then B.\"\n\n5. In logic, this type of inference is known as \"strengthening the antecedent\" or \"adding a conjunct to the antecedent.\"\n\n6. The key point is that adding an additional condition to the antecedent (the \"if\" part) does not change the consequent (the \"then\" part) if the original condition is still met.\n\n7. In this case, the original condition (\"the ploofle is blorped\") is still present in the new statement, along with an additional condition (\"and zooned\").\n\n8. Since the original condition is still met, the consequent (\"the fliggle will get a nurple\") must still follow, regardless of whether the ploofle is zooned or not.\n\n9. Therefore, this inference is logically valid. If the original statement is true, the new statement must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
