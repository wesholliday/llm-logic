            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the given statement: \"If the trankle is sploofed, then the zorple will quibble.\"\n\n2. This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the trankle is sploofed\"\n   B = \"the zorple will quibble\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the trankle is sploofed and the drib is flanked, then the zorple will quibble.\"\n\n4. This new statement is of the form \"If (A and C), then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the trankle is sploofed\"\n   C = \"the drib is flanked\"\n   B = \"the zorple will quibble\"\n\n5. In logic, there's a principle called \"strengthening the antecedent.\" This principle states that if a conditional statement is true, it remains true when you add additional conditions to the antecedent (the \"if\" part).\n\n6. In this case, we're adding the condition \"the drib is flanked\" to the original antecedent.\n\n7. The original statement tells us that whenever the trankle is sploofed, the zorple will quibble, regardless of any other conditions.\n\n8. Adding an extra condition (the drib being flanked) doesn't change this relationship. If the trankle is sploofed, the zorple will quibble whether or not the drib is flanked.\n\n9. Therefore, the new statement is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
