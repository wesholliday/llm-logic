            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the zibble is zapped, then the glorp will zoon.\"\n   This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The proposed inference is: \"If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon.\"\n   This is a more complex conditional statement of the form \"If A and C, then B.\"\n\n3. In logical terms, we're asking if we can infer (A and C) \u2192 B from A \u2192 B.\n\n4. This type of inference is valid and is known as \"strengthening the antecedent\" or \"antecedent strengthening.\"\n\n5. The reasoning behind this is that if B follows from A alone, it will still follow if we add any additional condition (in this case, \"the quib is squinked\").\n\n6. Adding an extra condition to the antecedent (the \"if\" part) doesn't change the consequent (the \"then\" part) if the original conditional is true.\n\n7. In other words, if the glorp zooning follows from the zibble being zapped, it will still follow if the zibble is zapped AND something else happens (like the quib being squinked).\n\n8. This inference preserves the truth of the original statement while adding an additional, irrelevant condition.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed make this inference logically.\n\nAnswer: yes"
