            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the fribble is in the snarp, then it is flugged.\"\n\n2. This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the fribble is in the snarp\"\n   B = \"it is flugged\"\n\n3. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the fribble is in the snarp and the snarp is flooping, then it is flugged.\"\n\n4. This new statement is of the form \"If A and C, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the fribble is in the snarp\"\n   C = \"the snarp is flooping\"\n   B = \"it is flugged\"\n\n5. The key point here is that the new statement adds an additional condition (C) to the antecedent, but keeps the same consequent (B).\n\n6. In logic, this type of inference is valid and is known as \"strengthening the antecedent\" or \"antecedent strengthening.\"\n\n7. The reasoning is that if B is true whenever A is true, then B must also be true when both A and C are true, regardless of what C is.\n\n8. The additional condition (the snarp is flooping) doesn't change the relationship between the fribble being in the snarp and it being flugged.\n\n9. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the new statement with the additional condition must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
