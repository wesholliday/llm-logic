            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the krimp is in the zool, then the snarf will be glonked.\"\n\n2. This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the krimp is in the zool and the zool is zapped, then the snarf will be glonked.\"\n\n4. This new statement is of the form \"If A and C, then B.\"\n\n5. In logic, this type of inference is known as \"strengthening the antecedent\" or \"antecedent strengthening.\"\n\n6. The key point is that adding an additional condition to the antecedent (the \"if\" part) doesn't change the consequent (the \"then\" part) if the original condition is still met.\n\n7. In this case, whether or not \"the zool is zapped\" doesn't affect the original relationship between \"the krimp being in the zool\" and \"the snarf being glonked.\"\n\n8. The new condition (\"the zool is zapped\") is irrelevant to the original logical relationship.\n\n9. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the new statement with the additional condition must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
