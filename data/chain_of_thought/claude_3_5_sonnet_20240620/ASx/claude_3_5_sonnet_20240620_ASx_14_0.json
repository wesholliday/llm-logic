            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the frizzle is dinked, then the zarp will splunk.\"\n   This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The proposed inference is: \"If the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped, then the zarp will splunk.\"\n   This is a more complex conditional statement of the form \"If A and C, then B.\"\n\n3. In logic, there's a principle called \"strengthening the antecedent.\" This principle states that if a conditional statement is true, it remains true when you add additional conditions to the antecedent (the \"if\" part).\n\n4. In this case, we're adding \"and the sklonk is grooped\" to the antecedent. This doesn't change the relationship between the frizzle being dinked and the zarp splunking.\n\n5. If it's true that the zarp will splunk whenever the frizzle is dinked, then it must also be true that the zarp will splunk when the frizzle is dinked AND any other condition is met (in this case, the sklonk being grooped).\n\n6. The additional condition doesn't interfere with or negate the original relationship; it just narrows the circumstances under which we're considering the original statement.\n\nTherefore, the inference is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
