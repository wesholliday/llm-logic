            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the given statement: \"If the plim is grobbled, then the whiffle will sploosh.\"\n\n2. This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the plim is grobbled\"\n   B = \"the whiffle will sploosh\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer: \"If the plim is grobbled and the drazzle is drooped, then the whiffle will sploosh.\"\n\n4. This new statement is of the form \"If (A and C), then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the plim is grobbled\"\n   C = \"the drazzle is drooped\"\n   B = \"the whiffle will sploosh\"\n\n5. In logic, there's a principle called \"strengthening the antecedent.\" This principle states that if a conditional statement is true, it remains true when you add additional conditions to the antecedent (the \"if\" part).\n\n6. In this case, we're adding the condition \"the drazzle is drooped\" to the original antecedent.\n\n7. The original statement tells us that whenever the plim is grobbled, the whiffle will sploosh, regardless of any other conditions.\n\n8. Adding the extra condition about the drazzle being drooped doesn't change this relationship. If the plim is grobbled, the whiffle will still sploosh, whether or not the drazzle is drooped.\n\n9. Therefore, the new statement is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
