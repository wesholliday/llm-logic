            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the given statement: \"If the klank is hooped, then the wuggy will zink.\"\n\n2. This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the klank is hooped\"\n   B = \"the wuggy will zink\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer a new statement: \"If the klank is hooped and the wuggy is out of zloat, then the wuggy will zink.\"\n\n4. This new statement is of the form \"If A and C, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the klank is hooped\"\n   C = \"the wuggy is out of zloat\"\n   B = \"the wuggy will zink\"\n\n5. In logic, there's a principle called \"strengthening the antecedent.\" This principle states that if a conditional statement is true, it remains true when you add additional conditions to the antecedent (the \"if\" part).\n\n6. In this case, we're adding the condition \"the wuggy is out of zloat\" to the original antecedent.\n\n7. The consequent (the \"then\" part) remains unchanged in both statements.\n\n8. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the new statement with the strengthened antecedent must also be true, regardless of whether \"the wuggy is out of zloat\" or not.\n\n9. The additional condition doesn't affect the logical relationship between \"the klank is hooped\" and \"the wuggy will zink.\"\n\nBased on this reasoning, we can indeed infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
