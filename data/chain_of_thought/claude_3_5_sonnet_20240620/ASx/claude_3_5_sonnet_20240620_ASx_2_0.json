            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If we crink the snoogle, then we'll plook a nurp.\"\n   This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The proposed inference is: \"If we crink the snoogle and a wug zites, then we'll plook a nurp.\"\n   This is a more complex conditional statement of the form \"If A and C, then B.\"\n\n3. In logic, there's a principle called \"strengthening the antecedent.\" This principle states that if a conditional statement is true, it remains true when you add additional conditions to the antecedent (the \"if\" part).\n\n4. In this case, we're adding \"and a wug zites\" to the antecedent. This doesn't change the consequent (the \"then\" part) or negate the original condition.\n\n5. The new statement is still saying that crinkling the snoogle leads to plooking a nurp, but now it's in a more specific scenario where a wug also zites.\n\n6. The addition of \"a wug zites\" doesn't interfere with or change the relationship between crinkling the snoogle and plooking a nurp.\n\n7. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the new statement with the strengthened antecedent must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
