            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the glunk snarbles, then the blip will be floinked.\"\n   This is a simple conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The statement we're asked about is: \"If the glunk snarbles and the troon is zibbled, then the blip will be floinked.\"\n   This is a more complex conditional statement of the form \"If A and C, then B.\"\n\n3. In logic, there's a principle called \"strengthening the antecedent.\" This principle states that if a conditional statement is true, it remains true when you add additional conditions to the antecedent (the \"if\" part).\n\n4. In this case, we're adding \"and the troon is zibbled\" to the antecedent.\n\n5. The original statement says that whenever the glunk snarbles, the blip will be floinked, regardless of any other conditions.\n\n6. Adding an extra condition (the troon being zibbled) doesn't change the fact that if the glunk snarbles, the blip will be floinked.\n\n7. Therefore, if the original statement is true, the new statement with the additional condition must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
