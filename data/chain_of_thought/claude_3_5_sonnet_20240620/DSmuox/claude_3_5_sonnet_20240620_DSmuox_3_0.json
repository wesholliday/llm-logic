            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) It's not the case that the splat must be quanked.\n   b) Either the splat is morphed or it must be quanked.\n\n2. Statement (a) can be simplified to: The splat does not have to be quanked.\n\n3. Statement (b) is a disjunction (either/or statement). It means one of the two options must be true:\n   - The splat is morphed\n   - The splat must be quanked\n\n4. From statement (a), we know that \"The splat must be quanked\" is false.\n\n5. In a disjunction, if one option is false, the other must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n6. Since we know \"The splat must be quanked\" is false, and it's one of the options in the disjunction, the other option must be true.\n\n7. Therefore, \"The splat is morphed\" must be true.\n\nThis logical deduction allows us to conclude that \"The splat is morphed\" can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
