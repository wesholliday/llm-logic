            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given the statement: \"If the package has shipped, then it will arrive today.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We are asked about a situation where two conditions are met: the package has shipped AND it was misrouted.\n\n3. The original statement doesn't mention anything about misrouting. It simply states that if the package has shipped, it will arrive today, regardless of any other factors.\n\n4. However, in reality, misrouting could potentially delay a package. But we are not asked to consider real-world logistics; we must only consider the logic of the given statement.\n\n5. The original statement is absolute: if the package has shipped, it WILL arrive today. There are no exceptions mentioned in this rule.\n\n6. Adding the condition of misrouting doesn't change the original statement. As long as the package has shipped, according to the given rule, it will arrive today.\n\n7. Therefore, even with the additional information about misrouting, we can still infer that if the package has shipped, it will arrive today, because that's what the original statement tells us without any exceptions.\n\nAnswer: yes"
