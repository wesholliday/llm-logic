            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The first statement says: \"If you get enough sleep, you won't be tired.\"\n   This establishes a simple cause-and-effect relationship between sleep and tiredness.\n\n2. The question then asks about a scenario where we add another factor: hard labor.\n\n3. We need to consider whether the original statement accounts for all possible factors that could cause tiredness, or if it's a simplified statement that doesn't consider other potential causes.\n\n4. In reality, tiredness can be caused by various factors, not just lack of sleep. Physical exertion, such as hard labor, is another well-known cause of tiredness.\n\n5. The original statement doesn't specify that sleep is the only factor affecting tiredness. It merely states that sufficient sleep prevents tiredness under normal circumstances.\n\n6. Adding hard labor introduces a new variable that wasn't considered in the original statement. This new factor could potentially cause tiredness independently of sleep.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the combination of enough sleep and hard labor will definitely result in not being tired. The hard labor might cause tiredness even if the person has had enough sleep.\n\n8. The original statement remains true, but it's not comprehensive enough to cover all scenarios, including the addition of hard labor.\n\nAnswer: no"
