            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given statement is: \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n   P = \"the essay is well-written\"\n   Q = \"the student will get an A\"\n\n3. The question asks about a new condition: \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A?\"\n\n4. This new condition adds an additional factor (turning in late) that wasn't present in the original statement.\n\n5. The original statement doesn't provide any information about how late submission affects grading.\n\n6. It's possible that late submission could negatively impact the grade, even if the essay is well-written.\n\n7. We cannot assume that the original condition still holds true when we add new factors that weren't initially specified.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that the student will still get an A if the essay is well-written but turned in late.\n\n9. To make such an inference, we would need additional information about the grading policy regarding late submissions.\n\nAnswer: no"
