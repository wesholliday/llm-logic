            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n   b) Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement: If A, then B.\n   A = Joe went to the park\n   B = Lucy went to the zoo\n\n3. The second statement introduces uncertainty about B (Lucy going to the zoo).\n\n4. In logic, if we know that B is false, we can conclude that A is also false. This is known as modus tollens.\n\n5. However, we don't know for certain that B is false. We only know that B might be false.\n\n6. The phrase \"might not have\" doesn't definitively state that Lucy didn't go to the zoo. It only introduces the possibility that she didn't go.\n\n7. Since we're not certain about B being false, we can't use modus tollens to conclude that A is false.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot definitively infer that Joe did not go to the park. We can only say that there's a possibility he didn't go, but we can't be certain.\n\nAnswer: no"
