            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n   b) The truck might not have been blue.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that whenever the car is red, the truck is definitely blue.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the second statement: \"The truck might not have been blue.\" This introduces uncertainty about the truck's color. It suggests there's a possibility that the truck was not blue.\n\n4. If we assume the car was red, then according to the first statement, the truck must be blue. However, this contradicts the second statement, which says the truck might not be blue.\n\n5. The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the car was not red. If the car wasn't red, then the condition in the first statement doesn't apply, and there's no conflict with the second statement.\n\n6. Therefore, to maintain logical consistency between both given statements, we must conclude that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
