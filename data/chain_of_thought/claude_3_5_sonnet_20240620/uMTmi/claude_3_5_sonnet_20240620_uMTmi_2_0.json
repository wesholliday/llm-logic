            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n   b) The unicorn might not have been in the forest.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement. It's a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The griffin was in the forest\n   B: The unicorn was in the forest\n\n3. The second statement tells us that B might not be true. This means there's a possibility that the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\n4. Now, let's think about the logical relationship between these statements:\n   - If A is true, B must be true (from the first statement)\n   - But B might not be true (from the second statement)\n\n5. These two points create a contradiction if A (the griffin being in the forest) were true. Here's why:\n   - If the griffin was in the forest, the unicorn must have been there too.\n   - But we're told the unicorn might not have been there.\n\n6. The only way to resolve this contradiction is if A is false - meaning the griffin was not in the forest.\n\n7. This type of reasoning is called modus tollens: If A implies B, and B is false, then A must be false.\n\nGiven this logical analysis, we can indeed infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: yes"
