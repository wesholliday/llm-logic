            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n   b) The truck might not have been metal.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the truck might not have been metal. This introduces uncertainty about the truck's material.\n\n4. Now, let's use logical reasoning:\n   - If the doll was plastic (A), then the truck must have been metal (B).\n   - But we're told that the truck might not have been metal (not B is possible).\n   - In logic, if we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B\" is true, we can conclude \"not A.\" This is known as modus tollens.\n\n5. However, we don't know for certain that the truck wasn't metal. We only know it might not have been metal. This uncertainty prevents us from definitively concluding that the doll was not plastic.\n\n6. If we knew for sure that the truck wasn't metal, we could conclude that the doll wasn't plastic. But since there's only a possibility that the truck wasn't metal, we can't make a definitive inference about the doll.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot conclusively infer that the doll was not plastic. We can only say that if the truck indeed turns out not to be metal, then the doll would not be plastic.\n\nAnswer: no"
