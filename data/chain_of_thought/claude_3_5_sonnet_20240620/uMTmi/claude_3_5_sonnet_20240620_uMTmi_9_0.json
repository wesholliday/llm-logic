            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement. It's a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B: Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement tells us that B (Mark bought the blue shirt) might not be true. This doesn't mean B is definitely false, just that it's possible that it's false.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the logical relationship between these statements:\n   - If A is true, then B must be true (from statement 1)\n   - But B might not be true (from statement 2)\n\n5. This creates a potential contradiction. If Lisa bought the red shirt (A is true), then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (B must be true). But we're told that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\n6. To resolve this potential contradiction, we can conclude that A (Lisa bought the red shirt) must be false. If A were true, it would force B to be true, which contradicts the second statement.\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
