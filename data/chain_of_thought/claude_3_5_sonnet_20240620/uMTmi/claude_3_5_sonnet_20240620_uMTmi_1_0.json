            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n   b) Sue might not have been at the wedding.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n   This is a conditional statement. It means that Mary's presence guarantees Sue's presence, but it doesn't say anything about what happens if Mary is not there.\n\n3. The second statement tells us that \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\"\n   This introduces uncertainty about Sue's presence. It doesn't definitively state that Sue wasn't there, just that it's a possibility.\n\n4. Now, let's combine these pieces of information:\n   - If Mary was there, Sue must have been there (from statement 1).\n   - But Sue might not have been there (from statement 2).\n\n5. These two statements create a contradiction if Mary was at the wedding. If Mary was there, Sue must have been there, which conflicts with the possibility that Sue might not have been there.\n\n6. To resolve this contradiction, we can conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. If Mary had been there, it would force Sue to be there, which contradicts the second statement.\n\n7. Therefore, the only way to make both statements true is if Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
