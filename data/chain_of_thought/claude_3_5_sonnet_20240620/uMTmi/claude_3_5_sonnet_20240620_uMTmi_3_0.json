            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\n   b) The book might not be a mystery novel.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the book was written by James\"\n   B = \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that the book might not be a mystery novel. This means that there's a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\n4. Now, let's use logical reasoning:\n   - If the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel (given).\n   - But we know that the book might not be a mystery novel.\n   - If there's a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot be true that the book was definitely written by James.\n\n5. This is an example of modus tollens, a form of logical reasoning:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n   In our case:\n   If James wrote the book (P), then it's a mystery novel (Q).\n   It might not be a mystery novel (not Q).\n   Therefore, James did not write the book (not P).\n\n6. The possibility that the book is not a mystery novel contradicts the certainty that would exist if James had written it. Therefore, we can conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
