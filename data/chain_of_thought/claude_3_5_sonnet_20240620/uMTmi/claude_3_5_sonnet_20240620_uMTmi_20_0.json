            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n   b) The banana might not have been yellow.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\" This is a conditional statement. It means that if the condition (apple is red) is true, then the consequence (banana is yellow) must also be true.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the second statement: \"The banana might not have been yellow.\" This introduces uncertainty about the banana's color. It doesn't definitively state that the banana wasn't yellow, but it opens up the possibility that it might not have been.\n\n4. If we assume the apple was red, then according to the first statement, the banana must have been yellow. However, this conflicts with the second statement, which says the banana might not have been yellow.\n\n5. To resolve this conflict, we must conclude that the initial assumption (that the apple was red) cannot be true. If it were true, there would be no possibility for the banana to not be yellow, which contradicts the second statement.\n\n6. Therefore, to maintain logical consistency with both given statements, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
