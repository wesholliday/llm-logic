            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement says \"The application must have been completed online or in person.\"\n2. This statement presents two possible ways to complete the application: online OR in person.\n3. The word \"or\" indicates that either option is acceptable and valid.\n4. The statement we're asked to infer says \"The application must have been completed in person.\"\n5. This inferred statement only includes one of the two options from the original statement.\n6. By stating that the application \"must have been completed in person,\" it excludes the possibility of completing it online.\n7. The original statement allows for both online and in-person completion, while the inferred statement only allows for in-person completion.\n8. Therefore, the inferred statement is more restrictive than the original statement.\n9. We cannot logically conclude that the application must have been completed in person when the original statement clearly allows for online completion as well.\n\nAnswer: no"
