            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement says \"The package must have been delivered yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n2. This statement presents two possibilities for when the package was delivered:\n   a) Yesterday\n   b) The day before yesterday\n\n3. The word \"or\" in this context indicates that either of these possibilities could be true, but not necessarily both.\n\n4. The statement we're asked to infer is \"The package must have been delivered the day before.\"\n\n5. This inferred statement is more specific, as it only allows for one possibility: the package was delivered the day before yesterday.\n\n6. The original statement allows for the possibility that the package was delivered yesterday, which the inferred statement does not.\n\n7. Therefore, the inferred statement is more restrictive than the original statement and eliminates a possibility that the original statement allows.\n\n8. We cannot logically conclude that the package must have been delivered the day before yesterday based solely on the information given in the original statement.\n\n9. To make such an inference, we would need additional information that rules out the possibility of the package being delivered yesterday.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot infer the more specific statement from the original, more general statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
