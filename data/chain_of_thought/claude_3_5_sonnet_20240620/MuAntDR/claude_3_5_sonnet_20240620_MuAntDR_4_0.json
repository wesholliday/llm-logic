            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The meeting must have been at 2 PM or cancelled.\"\n2. This statement presents two possibilities: either the meeting was at 2 PM, or it was cancelled.\n3. The word \"or\" indicates that these are mutually exclusive options - it's one or the other, but not both.\n4. The use of \"must have been\" suggests that these are the only two possibilities; there are no other options.\n5. To infer that \"The meeting must have been cancelled,\" we would need to be certain that it wasn't at 2 PM.\n6. However, the original statement doesn't provide any information that eliminates the 2 PM option.\n7. Without additional information, we can't rule out either possibility.\n8. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that the meeting was cancelled, as it could have been at 2 PM.\n\nAnswer: no"
