            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n   This is the contrapositive of the original statement, in the form \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4. To understand this better, let's consider the four possible scenarios:\n   a) Red car and blue truck (satisfies the original statement)\n   b) Red car and not blue truck (contradicts the original statement)\n   c) Not red car and blue truck (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   d) Not red car and not blue truck (satisfies the contrapositive)\n\n5. The original statement rules out scenario b. This means that if the truck is not blue, the car cannot be red (which is exactly what the contrapositive states).\n\n6. Therefore, the contrapositive \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
