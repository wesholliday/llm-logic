            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   B = \"the mummy was awake\"\n\n3. Now, let's look at the statement we're asked to infer: \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\n4. This is also a conditional statement, but in the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n5. In logic, this form is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n6. A fundamental rule in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. They always have the same truth value.\n\n7. This means that \"If A, then B\" is logically equivalent to \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n8. Therefore, the statement \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\" is indeed a valid inference from the original statement.\n\n9. We can verify this with a truth table or by considering all possible scenarios, and we'll find that whenever the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
