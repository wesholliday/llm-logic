            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\"\n   This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n   This is of the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of inference is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true.\n\n5. To see why this works, let's consider the possibilities:\n   - If the bear is in the cave, the wolf must be in the den (given statement).\n   - If the wolf is not in the den, the bear cannot be in the cave (because if it were, the wolf would have to be in the den).\n\n6. Another way to think about it: If the bear being in the cave guarantees the wolf is in the den, then the wolf not being in the den guarantees the bear is not in the cave.\n\n7. This logical relationship holds regardless of whether the bear is actually in the cave or the wolf is actually in the den. It's about the logical connection between these two conditions.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer the given statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
