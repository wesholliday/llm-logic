            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"the dog was inside\"\n   Q = \"the cat was outside\"\n\n2. We need to determine if we can infer: \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside.\"\n   This is another conditional statement in the form \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of inference is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If P, then Q\" is always \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\n4. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n5. Let's verify:\n   Original: If the dog was inside (P), then the cat was outside (Q)\n   Contrapositive: If the cat was not outside (not Q), then the dog was not inside (not P)\n\n6. These statements are indeed logically equivalent. If we know the cat is not outside, it must mean the dog is not inside, because if the dog were inside, the cat would have to be outside according to the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"If the cat was not outside, then the dog was not inside\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
