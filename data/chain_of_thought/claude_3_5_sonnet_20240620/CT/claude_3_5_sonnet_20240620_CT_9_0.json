            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n   This is another conditional statement, but in the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n3. In logic, this transformation is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive of a conditional statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n5. To see why this is the case, let's consider the possibilities:\n   - If Lisa bought the red shirt (A is true), then Mark must have bought the blue shirt (B is true).\n   - If Mark didn't buy the blue shirt (B is false), then Lisa couldn't have bought the red shirt (A must be false), because if she had, it would contradict the original statement.\n\n6. Therefore, the contrapositive \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
