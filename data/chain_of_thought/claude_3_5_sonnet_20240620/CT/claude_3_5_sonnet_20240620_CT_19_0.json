            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n   This is the contrapositive of the original statement, in the form \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n4. To understand this better, let's consider the four possible scenarios:\n   a) Tom watched football and Jen watched basketball (satisfies the original statement)\n   b) Tom watched football and Jen didn't watch basketball (contradicts the original statement)\n   c) Tom didn't watch football and Jen watched basketball (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   d) Tom didn't watch football and Jen didn't watch basketball (satisfies the contrapositive)\n\n5. As we can see, any scenario that satisfies the original statement also satisfies the contrapositive, and any scenario that contradicts one also contradicts the other.\n\n6. Therefore, the contrapositive \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football\" can indeed be logically inferred from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
