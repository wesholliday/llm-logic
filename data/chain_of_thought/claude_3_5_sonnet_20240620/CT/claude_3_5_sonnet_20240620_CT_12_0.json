            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\"\n   This is the contrapositive of the original statement, in the form \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4. To understand this better, let's consider the four possible scenarios:\n   a) Joe went to the park and Lucy went to the zoo (satisfies the original statement)\n   b) Joe went to the park and Lucy didn't go to the zoo (contradicts the original statement)\n   c) Joe didn't go to the park and Lucy went to the zoo (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   d) Joe didn't go to the park and Lucy didn't go to the zoo (satisfies the contrapositive)\n\n5. The original statement rules out scenario b. This means that if we know Lucy didn't go to the zoo, Joe couldn't have gone to the park (because that would be scenario b).\n\n6. Therefore, the contrapositive \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
