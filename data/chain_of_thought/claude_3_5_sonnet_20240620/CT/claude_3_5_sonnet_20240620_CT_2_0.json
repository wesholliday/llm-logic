            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n   This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\"\n   This is a conditional statement of the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of inference is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n4. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n5. Let's break it down:\n   - Original: If griffin in forest (A), then unicorn in forest (B)\n   - Contrapositive: If unicorn not in forest (not B), then griffin not in forest (not A)\n\n6. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
