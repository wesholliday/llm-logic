            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\"\n   This is the contrapositive of the original statement, in the form \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4. To understand this better, let's consider the four possible scenarios:\n   a) Red apple and yellow banana (satisfies the original statement)\n   b) Red apple and non-yellow banana (contradicts the original statement)\n   c) Non-red apple and yellow banana (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   d) Non-red apple and non-yellow banana (satisfies the contrapositive)\n\n5. The original statement rules out scenario b. This means that if we have a non-yellow banana (not Q), the apple cannot be red (not P), because that would lead to the contradictory scenario b.\n\n6. Therefore, the contrapositive \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red\" must be true if the original statement is true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
