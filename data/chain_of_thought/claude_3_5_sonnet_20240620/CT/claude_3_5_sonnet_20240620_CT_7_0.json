            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race.\"\n   This is another conditional statement, but in the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n3. In logic, when we reverse a conditional statement and negate both parts, it's called the contrapositive.\n   The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n4. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, the contrapositive must also be true.\n\n5. In our case:\n   Original statement: If Alex finished (A), then Chris finished (B).\n   Contrapositive: If Chris did not finish (not B), then Alex did not finish (not A).\n\n6. Since the contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\nAnswer: yes"
