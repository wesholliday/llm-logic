            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n   This is another conditional statement, but in the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n3. In logic, when we flip the order and negate both parts of a conditional statement, we create what's called the contrapositive.\n\n4. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n5. A fundamental rule in logic is that a statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. They always have the same truth value.\n\n6. Therefore, if the original statement \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\" is true, then its contrapositive \"If Bob did not choose pasta, then Sue did not choose pizza\" must also be true.\n\n7. This means we can indeed infer the second statement from the first one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
