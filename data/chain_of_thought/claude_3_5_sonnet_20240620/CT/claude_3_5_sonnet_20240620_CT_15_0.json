            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\"\n   This is the contrapositive of the original statement, in the form \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n4. To understand this better, let's consider the four possible scenarios:\n   a) Sam took a plane and Erin took a train (satisfies the original statement)\n   b) Sam took a plane and Erin didn't take a train (contradicts the original statement)\n   c) Sam didn't take a plane and Erin took a train (doesn't contradict the original statement)\n   d) Sam didn't take a plane and Erin didn't take a train (satisfies the contrapositive)\n\n5. The original statement rules out scenario b. This means that if we know Erin didn't take a train, the only remaining possibility that doesn't contradict the original statement is scenario d, where Sam also didn't take a plane.\n\n6. Therefore, the contrapositive \"If Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
