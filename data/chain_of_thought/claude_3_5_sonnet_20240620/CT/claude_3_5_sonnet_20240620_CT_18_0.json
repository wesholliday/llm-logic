            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"the doll was plastic\"\n   Q = \"the truck was metal\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n   This is another conditional statement in the form \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of inference is called the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n5. To see why this is true, consider the possibilities:\n   - If the doll is plastic, the truck must be metal (given)\n   - If the truck is not metal, the doll cannot be plastic (because if it were, the truck would have to be metal)\n\n6. Therefore, the statement \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
