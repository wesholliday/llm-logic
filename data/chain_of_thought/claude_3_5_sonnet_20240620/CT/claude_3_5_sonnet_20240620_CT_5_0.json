            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball.\"\n   This is the contrapositive of the original statement, in the form \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n3. In logic, the contrapositive of a conditional statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n4. To understand this better, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n   - If Jeff played basketball, Amy must have played tennis (given in the original statement).\n   - If Amy didn't play tennis, Jeff couldn't have played basketball (because if he had, Amy would have played tennis).\n\n5. The contrapositive effectively \"works backwards\" from the original statement, and it always holds true if the original statement is true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
