            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton.\" This is in the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of inference is known as the contrapositive. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n4. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n5. Let's break it down:\n   - Original: If (shirt is cotton), then (pants are denim)\n   - Contrapositive: If (pants are not denim), then (shirt is not cotton)\n\n6. Since these are logically equivalent, we can indeed infer the second statement from the first.\n\n7. To further illustrate: If it's true that cotton shirts always come with denim pants, then it must also be true that non-denim pants never come with cotton shirts. If they did, it would contradict the original statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the rules of logical inference, we can conclude that the given inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
