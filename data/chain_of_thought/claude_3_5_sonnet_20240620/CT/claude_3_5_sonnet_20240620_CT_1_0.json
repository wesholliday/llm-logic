            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\"\n\n2. We're asked if we can infer: \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n   This is another conditional statement, but in the form \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\n3. In logic, this type of inference is called the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. The contrapositive is always logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive is also true, and vice versa.\n\n5. To see why this is true, let's consider the possibilities:\n   - If Mary was at the wedding, Sue must have been there (according to the original statement).\n   - If Sue wasn't at the wedding, Mary couldn't have been there (because if she was, Sue would have to be there too).\n\n6. Another way to think about it is that the only way the original statement could be false is if Mary was at the wedding but Sue wasn't. This scenario is ruled out by both the original statement and its contrapositive.\n\n7. Therefore, the statement \"If Sue was not at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" is a valid inference from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
