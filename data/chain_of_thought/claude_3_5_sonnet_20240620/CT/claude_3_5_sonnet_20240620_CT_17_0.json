            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's consider the original statement: \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad.\" This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q,\" where:\n   P = \"Ben ate pasta\"\n   Q = \"Kate ate the salad\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\" This is also a conditional statement, but in the form \"If not Q, then not P.\"\n\n3. In logic, the statement \"If not Q, then not P\" is known as the contrapositive of the original statement \"If P, then Q.\"\n\n4. A fundamental rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. They always have the same truth value.\n\n5. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true, and vice versa.\n\n6. Therefore, from the given statement \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad,\" we can indeed logically infer \"If Kate did not eat the salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\n7. This inference is valid regardless of whether Ben actually ate pasta or whether Kate actually ate the salad. The logical relationship between the statements holds true in all cases.\n\nAnswer: yes"
