            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the given statement:\n   \"If A, then B\" where:\n   A = \"the alien visited Mars\"\n   B = \"the robot visited Jupiter\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"If not B, then not A\"\n\n3. This is a form of logical reasoning called contraposition. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is indeed \"If not B, then not A\".\n\n4. To understand why this is valid, let's consider the truth table:\n   - If A is true and B is false, the original statement would be false.\n   - If A is false and B is true, the original statement is still true.\n   - If both A and B are true, the original statement is true.\n   - If both A and B are false, the original statement is still true.\n\n5. The only way for \"If A, then B\" to be false is if A is true and B is false.\n\n6. Therefore, if B is false (the robot did not visit Jupiter), A must also be false (the alien did not visit Mars) for the original statement to remain true.\n\n7. This demonstrates that \"If not B, then not A\" is a valid inference from \"If A, then B\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
