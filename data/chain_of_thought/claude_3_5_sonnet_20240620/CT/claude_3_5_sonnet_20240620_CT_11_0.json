            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the original statement:\n   \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"the cake was chocolate\"\n   Q = \"the muffins were blueberry\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If the muffins were not blueberry, then the cake was not chocolate\"\n\n4. This new statement is in the form \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\n5. In logic, this form is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n6. The contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement. It always has the same truth value as the original statement.\n\n7. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n8. Therefore, we can indeed infer the contrapositive from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
