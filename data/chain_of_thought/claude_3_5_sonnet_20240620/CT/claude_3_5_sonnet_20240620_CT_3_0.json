            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the given statement:\n   \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n2. This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"the book was written by James\"\n   Q = \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n3. The question asks if we can infer:\n   \"If the book is not a mystery novel, then the book was not written by James\"\n\n4. This new statement is in the form \"If not Q, then not P\"\n\n5. In logic, this form is known as the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n6. A key rule in logic is that a conditional statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. They always have the same truth value.\n\n7. This means that if the original statement is true, its contrapositive must also be true.\n\n8. Therefore, from the given statement, we can indeed logically infer the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: yes"
