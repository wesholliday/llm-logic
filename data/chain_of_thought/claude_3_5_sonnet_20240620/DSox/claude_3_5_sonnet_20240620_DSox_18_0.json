            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The shank is not nugged\"\n   b) \"Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the shank is plooked, or it is nugged.\n\n3. Statement (a) explicitly states that the shank is not nugged. This eliminates one of the possibilities from statement (b).\n\n4. In logical terms, we can represent this as:\n   Not(Nugged) AND (Plooked OR Nugged)\n\n5. Since we know for certain that \"Nugged\" is false, the only way for the disjunction (Plooked OR Nugged) to be true is if \"Plooked\" is true.\n\n6. This is an application of the logical rule known as disjunctive syllogism: if we have (A OR B), and we know that Not B is true, then A must be true.\n\n7. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The shank is plooked\" must be true to satisfy both given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
