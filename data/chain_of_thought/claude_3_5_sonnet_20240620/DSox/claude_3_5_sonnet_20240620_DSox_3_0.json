            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) The splat is not quanked\n   b) Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked\n\n2. Statement (b) is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true: either the splat is morphed, or it is quanked, or both.\n\n3. From statement (a), we know that the splat is definitely not quanked.\n\n4. Since the splat is not quanked, and statement (b) tells us it must be either morphed or quanked, the only remaining possibility is that the splat is morphed.\n\n5. This is an example of disjunctive syllogism: when we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that the splat must be morphed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
