            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The investment might be risky and offer high returns.\"\n\n2. This statement is a compound statement, consisting of two parts connected by \"and\":\n   a) \"The investment might be risky\"\n   b) \"[The investment might] offer high returns\"\n\n3. The word \"might\" applies to both parts of the statement, indicating possibility for both the risk and the high returns.\n\n4. When we have a compound statement joined by \"and,\" we can infer each individual part of the statement separately.\n\n5. Therefore, we can extract the first part of the statement: \"The investment might be risky.\"\n\n6. The extracted statement is identical to the one we're asked about in the question.\n\n7. Since this statement is directly present in the original sentence, without any alteration in meaning or possibility, we can indeed infer it from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
