            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We start with the statement: \"The grazzle must be snork on zibble\"\n\n2. The question asks if we can infer: \"The grazzle must be snork on zibble or wump wump wozzle\"\n\n3. In logic, there's a principle called \"disjunction introduction\" or \"addition\". This principle states that if a statement P is true, then the statement \"P or Q\" is also true, regardless of whether Q is true or false.\n\n4. In this case, \"The grazzle must be snork on zibble\" is our P, and \"wump wump wozzle\" is our Q.\n\n5. Since we know P is true (given in the original statement), we can logically add \"or wump wump wozzle\" without changing the truth value of the statement.\n\n6. The new statement \"The grazzle must be snork on zibble or wump wump wozzle\" is a logical extension of the original statement, and it remains true regardless of the truth value of \"wump wump wozzle\".\n\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer the new statement from the original one.\n\nAnswer: yes"
