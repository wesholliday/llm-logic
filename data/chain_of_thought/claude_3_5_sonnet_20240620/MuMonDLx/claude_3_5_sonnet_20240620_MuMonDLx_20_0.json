            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The wozzle must be floob.\"\n2. This is a definitive statement, asserting that the wozzle has the property of being floob.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The wozzle must be floob or glorp.\"\n4. In logic, when we have a true statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B, because if A is true, then \"A or B\" is always true regardless of whether B is true or false.\n5. This is known as the rule of disjunction introduction or addition in formal logic.\n6. In this case, \"The wozzle must be floob\" is our A, and \"The wozzle must be glorp\" is our B.\n7. Even if we don't know anything about \"glorp,\" the statement \"floob or glorp\" is still logically true if we know \"floob\" is true.\n8. Therefore, the inference is logically valid and can be made without changing the truth of the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
