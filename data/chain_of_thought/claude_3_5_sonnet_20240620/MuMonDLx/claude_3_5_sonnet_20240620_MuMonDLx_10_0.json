            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The frazzle must be froodle.\"\n2. This is a definitive statement, indicating that the frazzle has only one possibility: it must be froodle.\n3. The proposed inference is \"The frazzle must be froodle or wobble.\"\n4. This new statement introduces an additional possibility: wobble.\n5. In logic, when we have a statement \"A must be B,\" it is always true that \"A must be B or C\" (or any other additional option).\n6. This is because the original statement is still satisfied even if we add more options. The frazzle being froodle fulfills the condition of being \"froodle or wobble.\"\n7. Adding \"or wobble\" doesn't change the truth of the original statement; it merely introduces an additional possibility that doesn't contradict the original.\n8. This type of inference is known as a logical weakening or disjunction introduction.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"The frazzle must be froodle or wobble\" from \"The frazzle must be froodle.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
