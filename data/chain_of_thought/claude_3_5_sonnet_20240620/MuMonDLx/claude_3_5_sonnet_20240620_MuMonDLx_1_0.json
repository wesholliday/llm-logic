            "content": "Explanation: To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The floob must be snizzle a quank\"\n2. The proposed inference is: \"The floob must be snizzle a quank or wobble\"\n3. In logic, when we have a statement A, we can always infer \"A or B\" for any B, because if A is true, then \"A or B\" is always true regardless of whether B is true or false.\n4. This is known as the law of disjunction introduction or addition in propositional logic.\n5. In this case, \"The floob must be snizzle a quank\" is our A, and \"wobble\" is our B.\n6. Adding \"or wobble\" to the original statement does not change its truth value; it only broadens the possibilities.\n7. Therefore, the inference is logically valid, even though it adds information not present in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
