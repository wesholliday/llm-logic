            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden.\n   b) It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden.\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of these must be true:\n   - Fido is inside\n   - Fido must be in the garden\n\n3. The second statement directly negates one part of the disjunction. It tells us that \"Fido must be in the garden\" is false.\n\n4. In a logical disjunction, if one part is false, the other must be true for the entire statement to be true.\n\n5. Since we know that \"Fido must be in the garden\" is false, and the original disjunction must be true (as it was given as a fact), we can conclude that the other part of the disjunction must be true.\n\n6. Therefore, \"Fido is inside\" must be true.\n\nThis is a classic example of the logical rule of disjunctive syllogism: given \"A or B\" and \"not B\", we can conclude \"A\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
