            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". It doesn't say anything about what happens if B is true.\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B (Sue was at the wedding) is true.\n\n4. However, the conditional statement doesn't work in reverse. Just because the consequent (B) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (A) is true.\n\n5. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent\".\n\n6. To illustrate, consider this example:\n   \"If it's raining, the grass is wet.\"\n   \"The grass is wet.\"\n   We can't conclude from this that it's raining, because the grass could be wet for other reasons (like sprinklers).\n\n7. Similarly, in our case, Sue could have been at the wedding for reasons unrelated to Mary's presence.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically conclude that Mary was at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
