            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, let's consider what each premise tells us:\n   - Premise 1 states that if the apple was red (A), then the banana must have been yellow (B).\n   - Premise 2 states that it's not the case that the banana must have been yellow (Not B).\n\n4. The conclusion states that the apple was not red (Not A).\n\n5. The logic works as follows:\n   - If A implies B, and B is false, then A must also be false.\n   - This is because if A were true, B would have to be true (according to Premise 1).\n   - But we know B is not true (from Premise 2).\n   - Therefore, A cannot be true.\n\n6. This form of reasoning is considered logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. There's no way for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n7. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on the actual truth of the statements, but on the form of the argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
