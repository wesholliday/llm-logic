            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n   Premise 2: It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n   Conclusion: Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). The general form is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n3. In this case:\n   P = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   Q = \"Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n\n4. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship: If P, then Q.\n\n5. The second premise denies Q.\n\n6. The conclusion negates P.\n\n7. This follows the exact structure of Modus Tollens, which is a valid form of logical argument.\n\n8. The validity of an argument form means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. It doesn't depend on whether the premises or conclusion are actually true in reality, but on the logical relationship between them.\n\n9. In this case, if we accept that \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" and we also accept that \"It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding,\" then we must logically conclude that \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\nTherefore, this argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
