            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n3. In Modus Tollens, we start with a conditional statement (If A, then B), and then we deny the consequent (B). From this, we can logically conclude that the antecedent (A) must also be false.\n\n4. Let's break down the specific argument:\n   A: \"The car was red\"\n   B: \"The truck must have been blue\"\n\n5. The first premise establishes a relationship: If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n\n6. The second premise denies B: It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\n7. Given these premises, we can logically conclude that A must also be false: The car was not red.\n\n8. This reasoning is valid because if the initial condition were true (the car was red), it would necessitate something we know to be false (the truck must have been blue). Since this consequence is denied, the initial condition cannot be true.\n\n9. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on the actual truth of the premises or conclusion, but on the form of the argument. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true for a valid argument.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
