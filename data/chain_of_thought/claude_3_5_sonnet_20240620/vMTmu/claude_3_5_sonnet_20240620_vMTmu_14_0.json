            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n   Where A = \"the bear was in the cave\"\n   and B = \"the wolf must have been in the den\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It follows the logical structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n3. Modus Tollens is a valid form of logical argument. It works by reasoning that if the consequent (Q) is false, the antecedent (P) must also be false, given that P implies Q.\n\n4. In this specific case:\n   - If the bear was in the cave (P), then the wolf must have been in the den (Q)\n   - The wolf was not in the den (Not Q)\n   - Therefore, the bear was not in the cave (Not P)\n\n5. The logic here is sound: If we know that the bear being in the cave would necessitate the wolf being in the den, and we know the wolf was not in the den, we can validly conclude that the bear was not in the cave.\n\n6. It's important to note that the validity of the argument form doesn't depend on the truth of the premises or the conclusion, but on the logical relationship between them.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
