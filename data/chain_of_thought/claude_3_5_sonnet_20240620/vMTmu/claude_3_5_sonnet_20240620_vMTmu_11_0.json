Is this form of argument logically valid?",

            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n   Where A = \"the cake was chocolate\" and B = \"the muffins must have been blueberry\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It follows the logical structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, Not P\n\n3. Modus Tollens is a valid form of logical argument. It works by reasoning that if the consequent (Q) is false, the antecedent (P) must also be false, given that P implies Q.\n\n4. In this specific case:\n   - If the cake was chocolate (P), then the muffins must have been blueberry (Q)\n   - The muffins were not necessarily blueberry (Not Q)\n   - Therefore, the cake was not chocolate (Not P)\n\n5. The logic here is sound: If it's true that chocolate cake always implies blueberry muffins, and we know the muffins weren't necessarily blueberry, then we can validly conclude that the cake wasn't chocolate.\n\n6. It's important to note that the validity of the argument form doesn't depend on the truth of the premises or the conclusion in the real world. It only concerns the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
