            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not Q\n   Conclusion: Not P\n\n   Where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book must be a mystery novel\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It follows the logical structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, Not P\n\n3. Modus Tollens is a valid form of logical reasoning. It works by proving the contrapositive of the original statement.\n\n4. To understand why this is valid, let's consider the possibilities:\n   - If the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, and we know that Q is false (from the second premise), then P must also be false. \n   - If P were true, then Q would have to be true according to the first premise. But we know Q is not true from the second premise.\n   - Therefore, P cannot be true. It must be false.\n\n5. This form of argument is deductively valid, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n6. In this specific case:\n   - If the book was written by James, it must be a mystery novel.\n   - It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n   - Therefore, the book was not written by James.\n\nThis follows the Modus Tollens structure perfectly and is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
