            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not Q\n   Conclusion: Not P\n\n   Where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy must have gone to the zoo\"\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. Let's consider why this is valid:\n   - If the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, it establishes a conditional relationship between P and Q.\n   - The second premise (Not Q) denies the consequent of the conditional statement.\n   - If Q is false, and P implies Q, then P must also be false. Because if P were true, Q would have to be true according to the first premise.\n\n4. We can also verify this using a truth table:\n   P | Q | If P, then Q | Not Q | Not P\n   T | T |      T       |   F   |   F\n   T | F |      F       |   T   |   F\n   F | T |      T       |   F   |   T\n   F | F |      T       |   T   |   T\n\n   The only row where both premises are true (If P, then Q and Not Q) also has a true conclusion (Not P).\n\n5. This demonstrates that whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true, which is the definition of a logically valid argument.\n\nTherefore, this argument form is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
