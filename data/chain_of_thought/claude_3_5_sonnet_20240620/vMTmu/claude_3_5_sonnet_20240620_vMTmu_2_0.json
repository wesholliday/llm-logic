            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n   Where A = \"the griffin was in the forest\"\n   and B = \"the unicorn must have been in the forest\"\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. The logic behind Modus Tollens is:\n   - If the first statement (A) implies the second (B),\n   - And the second statement (B) is false,\n   - Then the first statement (A) must also be false.\n\n4. Let's consider why this is valid:\n   - If A truly implies B, then B must be true whenever A is true.\n   - If we know B is false, then A cannot be true, because if it were, B would have to be true (which we know it's not).\n\n5. In this specific case:\n   - If the griffin being in the forest implies the unicorn must have been there,\n   - And we know the unicorn wasn't necessarily there,\n   - Then we can conclude the griffin wasn't in the forest.\n\n6. This reasoning holds regardless of the actual truth of the premises. The validity of the argument form is about the logical connection between the premises and the conclusion, not about whether the premises themselves are true.\n\nTherefore, this argument form is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
