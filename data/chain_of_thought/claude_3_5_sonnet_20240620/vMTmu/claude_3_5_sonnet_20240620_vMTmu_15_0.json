            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not Q\n   Conclusion: Not P\n\n   Where P is \"Sam took a plane\" and Q is \"Erin must have taken a train\"\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. To understand why it's valid, let's consider the logic:\n   - If the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, it means that whenever P occurs, Q must also occur.\n   - The second premise (Not Q) states that Q did not occur.\n   - Given these two premises, P cannot have occurred, because if it had, Q would have occurred (which we know didn't happen).\n\n4. We can also verify this using a truth table:\n   P | Q | P\u2192Q | \u00acQ | \u00acP\n   T | T |  T  | F  | F\n   T | F |  F  | T  | F\n   F | T |  T  | F  | T\n   F | F |  T  | T  | T\n\n   The only row where both premises (P\u2192Q and \u00acQ) are true is the last row, where the conclusion (\u00acP) is also true.\n\n5. This demonstrates that in all possible scenarios where the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true, which is the definition of a logically valid argument.\n\nTherefore, this argument form is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
