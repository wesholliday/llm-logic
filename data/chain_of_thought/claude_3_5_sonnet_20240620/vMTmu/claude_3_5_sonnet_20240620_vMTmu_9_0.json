            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. Let's break it down:\n   A = \"Lisa bought the red shirt\"\n   B = \"Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"\n\n4. The first premise states that if A is true, then B must be true.\n\n5. The second premise states that B is not true.\n\n6. Given these premises, we can logically conclude that A cannot be true. If A were true, it would force B to be true (according to premise 1), but we know B is not true (from premise 2).\n\n7. Therefore, the only logically consistent conclusion is that A must be false.\n\n8. This reasoning holds regardless of the specific content of A and B. The form itself is what makes it valid.\n\n9. The conclusion \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" is indeed the logical negation of A, which is what we determined must be false.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
