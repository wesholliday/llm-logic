            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n   Where A = \"the dog was inside\" and B = \"the cat must have been outside\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It follows the logical structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n3. Modus Tollens is a valid form of deductive reasoning. It works by recognizing that if the consequent (Q) is false, the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\n4. In this specific argument:\n   - If the dog was inside (P), then the cat must have been outside (Q)\n   - It's not the case that the cat must have been outside (Not Q)\n   - Therefore, the dog was not inside (Not P)\n\n5. The logic here is sound. If we accept that the dog being inside necessitates the cat being outside, and we know the cat was not necessarily outside, we can validly conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\n6. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on the truth of the premises, but on the form of the argument. Even if the premises were factually incorrect, the form of the argument would still be logically valid.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
