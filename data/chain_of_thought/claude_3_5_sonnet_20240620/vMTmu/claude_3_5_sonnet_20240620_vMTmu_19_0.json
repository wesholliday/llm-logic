            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not Q\n   Conclusion: Not P\n\n   Where P is \"Tom watched football\" and Q is \"Jen must have watched basketball\"\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. To understand why it's valid, let's consider the logic:\n   - If the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, it means that whenever P occurs, Q must also occur.\n   - The second premise (Not Q) states that Q did not occur.\n   - Given these two premises, P cannot have occurred, because if it had, Q would have occurred (which we know didn't happen).\n   - Therefore, we can conclude Not P.\n\n4. This form of argument is valid regardless of the specific content. It doesn't matter what P and Q actually represent; the logical structure ensures that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n5. In this specific case:\n   - If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n   - Jen did not watch basketball.\n   - Therefore, Tom did not watch football.\n\nThe logic holds, and the argument form is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
