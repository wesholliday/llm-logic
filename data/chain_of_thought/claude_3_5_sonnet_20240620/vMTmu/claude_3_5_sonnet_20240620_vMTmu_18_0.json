            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: Not Q\n   Conclusion: Not P\n\n   Where P is \"the doll was plastic\" and Q is \"the truck must have been metal\"\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. To understand why it's valid, let's consider the logic:\n   - If the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, it means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true.\n   - The second premise states that Q is not true.\n   - Given these two premises, P cannot be true. If P were true, then Q would have to be true (according to the first premise), but we know Q is not true (from the second premise).\n   - Therefore, the only logical conclusion is that P must be false.\n\n4. This form of argument is valid regardless of the actual content of P and Q. It relies solely on the logical structure.\n\n5. In this specific case:\n   - If the doll being plastic necessitates the truck being metal, and we know the truck is not metal, then we can conclude that the doll is not plastic.\n\n6. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't guarantee the truth of the conclusion in reality - it only guarantees that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
