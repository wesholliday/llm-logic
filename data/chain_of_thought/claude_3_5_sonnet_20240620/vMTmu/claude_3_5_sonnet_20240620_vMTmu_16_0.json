            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n3. In Modus Tollens, we start with a conditional statement (If A, then B), and then we deny the consequent (Not B). From this, we can logically conclude that the antecedent must also be false (Not A).\n\n4. Let's break down the specific argument:\n   A: The shirt was cotton\n   B: The pants must have been denim\n\n5. The argument states:\n   If A, then B (If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim)\n   Not B (It's not the case that the pants must have been denim)\n   Therefore, Not A (The shirt was not cotton)\n\n6. This perfectly follows the Modus Tollens structure.\n\n7. Modus Tollens is a valid form of logical reasoning. It always leads to a true conclusion if the premises are true.\n\n8. The validity of an argument form is independent of the truth of its premises or conclusion in any specific case. It only depends on whether the conclusion must be true if all the premises are true.\n\n9. In this case, if we accept both premises as true, the conclusion must logically follow.\n\nTherefore, this argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
