            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n   Where A = \"Alex finished the race\" and B = \"Chris must have finished the race\"\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. Let's consider why this is valid:\n   - If the first premise is true, it establishes a conditional relationship: A implies B.\n   - The second premise states that B is false.\n   - If A were true, then B would have to be true (according to the first premise).\n   - But we know B is false (from the second premise).\n   - Therefore, A must be false, otherwise we'd have a contradiction.\n\n4. We can also verify this using a truth table:\n   A | B | If A, then B | Not B | Not A\n   T | T |      T       |   F   |   F\n   T | F |      F       |   T   |   F\n   F | T |      T       |   F   |   T\n   F | F |      T       |   T   |   T\n\n   The only row where both premises are true (If A, then B) and (Not B) is the last row, where the conclusion (Not A) is also true.\n\n5. This demonstrates that whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true, which is the definition of a logically valid argument.\n\nTherefore, this argument form is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
