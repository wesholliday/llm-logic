            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n   Where A = \"the vampire was awake\" and B = \"the mummy must have been awake\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. The logic behind Modus Tollens is:\n   - If the first statement implies the second (If A, then B)\n   - And the second statement is false (Not B)\n   - Then the first statement must also be false (Not A)\n\n4. Let's consider why this is valid:\n   - If the first premise is true, then whenever A is true, B must also be true.\n   - The second premise states that B is not true.\n   - Therefore, A cannot be true, because if it were, it would force B to be true (which we know is not the case).\n\n5. In this specific example:\n   - If the vampire being awake implies the mummy must be awake,\n   - And we know the mummy wasn't necessarily awake,\n   - Then we can conclude the vampire wasn't awake.\n\n6. This reasoning holds regardless of the specific content of A and B. The form itself is what makes it valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
