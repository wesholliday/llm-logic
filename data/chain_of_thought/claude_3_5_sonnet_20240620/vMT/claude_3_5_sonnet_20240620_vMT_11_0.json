            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n   Where A = \"the cake was chocolate\" and B = \"the muffins were blueberry\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. To understand why it's valid, let's consider the logic:\n   - If the first premise (If A, then B) is true, it means that whenever A occurs, B must also occur.\n   - The second premise states that B did not occur.\n   - Therefore, A could not have occurred, because if it had, B would have occurred (according to the first premise).\n\n4. We can also think about it in terms of sets:\n   - The first premise establishes that all instances of A are contained within the set of B.\n   - If we know something is not in set B (premise 2), it logically cannot be in set A.\n\n5. This form of argument works regardless of the specific content. It doesn't matter what A and B actually represent; the logical structure remains valid.\n\n6. It's important to note that validity in logic doesn't mean the premises or conclusion are actually true in reality, only that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
