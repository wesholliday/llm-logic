            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n   Where A is \"the doll was plastic\" and B is \"the truck was metal\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. To understand why it's valid, let's consider the logic:\n   - If the first premise (If A, then B) is true, it means that whenever A occurs, B must also occur.\n   - The second premise states that B did not occur (Not B).\n   - Given these two premises, we can conclude that A could not have occurred either. If A had occurred, B would have had to occur (according to the first premise), but we know B didn't occur.\n\n4. We can also verify this using a truth table:\n   A | B | If A, then B | Not B | Not A\n   T | T |      T       |   F   |   F\n   T | F |      F       |   T   |   F\n   F | T |      T       |   F   |   T\n   F | F |      T       |   T   |   T\n\n   The only row where both premises are true (If A, then B) and (Not B) is the last row, where the conclusion (Not A) is also true.\n\n5. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
