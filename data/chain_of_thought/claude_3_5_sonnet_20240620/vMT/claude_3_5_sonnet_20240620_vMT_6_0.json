            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob chose pasta\n   Premise 2: Bob did not choose pasta\n   Conclusion: Sue did not choose pizza\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It follows the structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n3. In this case:\n   P = \"Sue chose pizza\"\n   Q = \"Bob chose pasta\"\n\n4. Modus Tollens is a valid form of argument in propositional logic. It works by reasoning that if the consequent (Q) is false, the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\n5. Let's consider why this is logically valid:\n   - If the first premise is true, it establishes a conditional relationship: Sue choosing pizza necessitates Bob choosing pasta.\n   - The second premise states that Bob did not choose pasta, which contradicts the consequent of the conditional statement.\n   - Given these premises, it's impossible for Sue to have chosen pizza, because if she had, Bob would have chosen pasta (which we know he didn't).\n\n6. Therefore, the only logically consistent conclusion is that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n7. This form of argument is valid regardless of whether the premises or conclusion are actually true in reality. Validity only concerns the logical structure of the argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
