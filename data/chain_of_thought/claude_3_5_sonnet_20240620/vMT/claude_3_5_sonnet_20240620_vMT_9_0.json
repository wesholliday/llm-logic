            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n3. To understand why this is valid, let's consider the logic:\n   - If the first premise (If A, then B) is true, it means that whenever A occurs, B must also occur.\n   - The second premise states that B did not occur.\n   - Given these two premises, it logically follows that A could not have occurred. If A had occurred, B would have had to occur (according to the first premise), but we know B didn't occur.\n\n4. We can also think about this using a truth table:\n   - If A is true and B is false, it would contradict the first premise.\n   - The only way for both premises to be true is if A is false and B is false.\n\n5. In the specific context of the question:\n   - If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n   - We know Mark didn't buy the blue shirt.\n   - Therefore, Lisa couldn't have bought the red shirt.\n\n6. This form of reasoning is considered logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
