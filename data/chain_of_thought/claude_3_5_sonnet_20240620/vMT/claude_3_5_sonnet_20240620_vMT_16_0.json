            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n3. To understand why this is valid, let's consider the logic:\n   - If the first premise (If A, then B) is true, it means that whenever A occurs, B must also occur.\n   - The second premise states that B did not occur (Not B).\n   - Given these two premises, it logically follows that A could not have occurred either. If A had occurred, B would have had to occur (according to the first premise), but we know B didn't occur.\n\n4. In this specific example:\n   - If the shirt was cotton (A), then the pants were denim (B).\n   - The pants were not denim (Not B).\n   - Therefore, the shirt was not cotton (Not A).\n\n5. This reasoning holds regardless of the actual content of A and B. The form itself is what makes it logically valid.\n\n6. A logically valid argument is one where if all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This argument form satisfies that condition.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
