            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo)\n   Premise 2: Not Q (Lucy did not go to the zoo)\n   Conclusion: Not P (Joe did not go to the park)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is Latin for \"mode of denying.\"\n\n3. The logic behind Modus Tollens is as follows:\n   - If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n   - This is because if P were true, it would necessitate Q being true (according to the first premise).\n   - But we know Q is false (from the second premise).\n   - Therefore, P cannot be true and must be false.\n\n4. Let's consider a concrete example to illustrate:\n   - If it's raining (P), then the ground is wet (Q).\n   - The ground is not wet (Not Q).\n   - Therefore, it's not raining (Not P).\n\n5. This form of reasoning is deductively valid, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n6. In our specific case:\n   - If Joe went to the park, it would necessitate Lucy going to the zoo.\n   - We know Lucy didn't go to the zoo.\n   - Therefore, Joe couldn't have gone to the park.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
