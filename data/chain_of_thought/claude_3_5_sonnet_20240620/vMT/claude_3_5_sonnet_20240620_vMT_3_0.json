            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n   Premise 2: Not Q (The book is not a mystery novel)\n   Conclusion: Not P (The book was not written by James)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is Latin for \"mode of denying.\"\n\n3. The logic behind Modus Tollens is:\n   If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\n4. To understand why this is valid, let's consider the possibilities:\n   - If P were true, then Q would have to be true (according to Premise 1).\n   - But we know Q is false (Premise 2).\n   - Therefore, P cannot be true. It must be false.\n\n5. This form of argument is considered logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. There's no way for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n6. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on the actual truth of the premises or conclusion, but on the form of the argument. Even if the content of the statements were different, as long as it follows this form, it would be logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
