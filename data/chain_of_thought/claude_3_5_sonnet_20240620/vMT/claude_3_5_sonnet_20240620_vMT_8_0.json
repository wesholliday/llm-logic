            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n   Premise 2: The mummy was not awake.\n   Conclusion: The vampire was not awake.\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It follows the structure:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n3. In this case:\n   P = \"The vampire was awake\"\n   Q = \"The mummy was awake\"\n\n4. Modus Tollens is a valid form of logical argument. Here's why:\n   - If the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, it means that whenever P is true, Q must also be true.\n   - The second premise states that Q is false (not Q).\n   - Given these two premises, P cannot be true. If P were true, then Q would have to be true (according to the first premise), but we know Q is false.\n   - Therefore, P must be false (not P).\n\n5. This reasoning holds regardless of the actual truth values of the statements about vampires and mummies. The validity of the argument form depends on its structure, not on the content of the statements.\n\n6. Since this argument follows the structure of Modus Tollens exactly, it is a logically valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: yes"
