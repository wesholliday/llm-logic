            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   Premise 2: Sue was not at the wedding.\n   Conclusion: Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It has the following logical structure:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not Q.\n   Therefore, not P.\n\n3. In this case:\n   P = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   Q = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n4. The logic works as follows:\n   - We know that if Mary was there, Sue must have been there (Premise 1).\n   - We also know that Sue wasn't there (Premise 2).\n   - Therefore, the condition for Mary being there (Sue being there) wasn't met.\n   - So, Mary couldn't have been there.\n\n5. This form of argument is considered logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. It's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n6. The validity of this argument doesn't depend on whether the premises are actually true in reality, but on the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this argument form is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
