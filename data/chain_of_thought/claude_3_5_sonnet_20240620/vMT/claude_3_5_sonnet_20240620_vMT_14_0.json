            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n   Where A = \"the bear was in the cave\" and B = \"the wolf was in the den\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n3. To understand why this is valid, let's consider the logic:\n   - If the first premise (If A, then B) is true, it means that whenever A occurs, B must also occur.\n   - The second premise states that B did not occur.\n   - Therefore, A could not have occurred, because if it had, B would have occurred (according to the first premise).\n\n4. We can also think about this in terms of sets:\n   - The first premise establishes that the set of situations where A is true is entirely contained within the set of situations where B is true.\n   - The second premise tells us we're not in a situation where B is true.\n   - Therefore, we can't be in a situation where A is true, because all A situations are B situations.\n\n5. This form of reasoning works regardless of the specific content of A and B. It's the structure that makes it valid, not the particular statements about bears and wolves.\n\n6. A logically valid argument is one where if all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. This argument form satisfies that condition.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
