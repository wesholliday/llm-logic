            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball)\n   Premise 2: Not Q (Jen did not watch basketball)\n   Conclusion: Not P (Tom did not watch football)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is Latin for \"mode of denying.\"\n\n3. The logic behind Modus Tollens is:\n   If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\n4. Let's think about why this works:\n   - If the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, it means that whenever P occurs, Q must also occur.\n   - The second premise states that Q did not occur.\n   - Therefore, P could not have occurred, because if it had, Q would have occurred (according to the first premise).\n\n5. This form of reasoning is considered valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. There's no way for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n6. In this specific example:\n   - If it's true that Tom watching football always results in Jen watching basketball,\n   - And we know for certain that Jen did not watch basketball,\n   - Then we can conclude with certainty that Tom did not watch football.\n\n7. The validity of this argument form holds regardless of the specific content. It would work for any \"If P, then Q\" statement followed by a denial of Q.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
