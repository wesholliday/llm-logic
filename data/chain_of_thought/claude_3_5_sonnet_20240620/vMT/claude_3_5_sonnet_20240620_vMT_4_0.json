            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Not A\n\n   Where A = \"the alien visited Mars\" and B = \"the robot visited Jupiter\"\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. To understand why it's valid, let's consider the logic:\n   - If the first premise (If A, then B) is true, it means that B must be true whenever A is true.\n   - The second premise states that B is not true.\n   - Therefore, A cannot be true, because if it were, B would have to be true (according to the first premise), but we know B is not true.\n\n4. We can also verify this using a truth table:\n   - If A is true and B is false, it would contradict the first premise.\n   - If A is false and B is false, it satisfies both premises.\n   - The other two possibilities (A true, B true; A false, B true) are irrelevant because we know B is false from the second premise.\n\n5. Thus, the only scenario that satisfies both premises is when A is false and B is false, which aligns with the conclusion.\n\n6. This reasoning holds regardless of the specific content of A and B. The form itself is what makes it valid, not the particular statements about aliens and robots.\n\nTherefore, this argument form is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
