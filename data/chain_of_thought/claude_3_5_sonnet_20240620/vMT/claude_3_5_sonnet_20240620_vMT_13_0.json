            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If the car was red, then the truck was blue)\n   Premise 2: Not Q (The truck was not blue)\n   Conclusion: Not P (The car was not red)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It follows the logical structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, Not P\n\n3. To understand why this is valid, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n   - If P is true, then Q must be true (according to Premise 1)\n   - But we know Q is false (Premise 2)\n   - Therefore, P cannot be true, because if it were, it would contradict Premise 2\n   - Thus, P must be false\n\n4. In terms of the specific example:\n   - If the car was red, the truck would have to be blue\n   - But we know the truck is not blue\n   - Therefore, the car cannot be red, because if it were, the truck would have to be blue (which it isn't)\n\n5. This form of reasoning is considered logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. There's no possible scenario where both premises are true and the conclusion is false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
