            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train)\n   Premise 2: Not Q (Erin did not take a train)\n   Conclusion: Not P (Sam did not take a plane)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is Latin for \"mode of denying.\"\n\n3. The logic behind Modus Tollens is:\n   If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\n4. Let's think about why this works:\n   - If the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, it means that whenever P occurs, Q must also occur.\n   - The second premise states that Q did not occur.\n   - Therefore, P could not have occurred, because if it had, Q would have occurred (according to the first premise).\n\n5. This form of reasoning is considered logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. There's no way for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n6. In this specific example:\n   - If it's true that Sam taking a plane always results in Erin taking a train,\n   - And we know for certain that Erin didn't take a train,\n   - Then we can conclude with certainty that Sam didn't take a plane.\n\n7. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on the actual truth of the premises or conclusion, but on the form of the argument. Even if the premises were false in reality, the form of the argument would still be valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
