            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis)\n   Premise 2: Not Q (Amy did not play tennis)\n   Conclusion: Not P (Jeff did not play basketball)\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It follows the structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, Not P\n\n3. To understand why this is valid, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n   - If the first premise is true, then whenever P is true, Q must also be true.\n   - The second premise states that Q is false.\n   - Given these two premises, P cannot be true. If it were, Q would have to be true (by the first premise), but we know Q is false (by the second premise).\n   - Therefore, P must be false.\n\n4. This reasoning holds regardless of the specific content of P and Q. It's based solely on the logical structure of the argument.\n\n5. A logically valid argument is one where if all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In this case, if both premises are true, the conclusion necessarily follows.\n\n6. Therefore, this argument form is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
