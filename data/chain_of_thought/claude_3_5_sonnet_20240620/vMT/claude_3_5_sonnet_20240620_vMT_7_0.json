            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then C (where A = \"Alex finished the race\" and C = \"Chris finished the race\")\n   Premise 2: Not C (Chris did not finish the race)\n   Conclusion: Not A (Alex did not finish the race)\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). It's one of the valid forms of deductive reasoning.\n\n3. To understand why it's valid, let's consider the logic:\n   - If the first premise is true, it means that Chris finishing is a necessary condition for Alex finishing.\n   - The second premise states that Chris didn't finish.\n   - If Chris didn't finish, and Chris finishing is necessary for Alex to finish, then Alex couldn't have finished.\n\n4. We can also think about it in terms of sets:\n   - The set of scenarios where Alex finishes is entirely contained within the set of scenarios where Chris finishes.\n   - If we know we're not in the set where Chris finishes, we can't be in the subset where Alex finishes.\n\n5. Another way to verify this is to consider the contrapositive of the first premise:\n   - \"If Chris did not finish the race, then Alex did not finish the race\"\n   - This is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n   - When we combine this with the second premise, we directly arrive at the conclusion.\n\n6. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on the actual truth of the premises or conclusion, but on the form of the argument. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this argument form is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
