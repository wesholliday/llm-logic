            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B (If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside)\n   Premise 2: Not B (The cat was not outside)\n   Conclusion: Not A (The dog was not inside)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is Latin for \"mode of denying.\"\n\n3. The logic behind Modus Tollens is:\n   If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\n4. In this case:\n   P: The dog was inside\n   Q: The cat was outside\n\n5. The first premise establishes that P implies Q.\n\n6. The second premise states that Q is false.\n\n7. Following the logic of Modus Tollens, if Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\n8. Therefore, the conclusion \"The dog was not inside\" (Not P) logically follows from the premises.\n\n9. This form of argument preserves truth: if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\nGiven this analysis, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
