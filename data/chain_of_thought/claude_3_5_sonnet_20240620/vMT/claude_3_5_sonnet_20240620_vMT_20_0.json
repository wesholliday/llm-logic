            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: Not B\n   Conclusion: Therefore, not A\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n3. To understand why this is valid, let's consider the logic:\n   - If the first premise (If A, then B) is true, it means that whenever A occurs, B must also occur.\n   - The second premise states that B did not occur.\n   - Given these two premises, it logically follows that A could not have occurred. If A had occurred, B would have had to occur (according to the first premise), but we know B didn't occur.\n\n4. We can also verify this using a truth table:\n   - If A is true and B is false, the first premise would be false.\n   - But we know the first premise is given as true.\n   - Therefore, the only consistent possibility is that A is false and B is false.\n\n5. In the specific example given:\n   - If the apple being red always leads to the banana being yellow,\n   - And we know the banana is not yellow,\n   - Then we can conclude that the apple cannot be red.\n\n6. This form of reasoning works regardless of the specific content; it's the structure that makes it valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
