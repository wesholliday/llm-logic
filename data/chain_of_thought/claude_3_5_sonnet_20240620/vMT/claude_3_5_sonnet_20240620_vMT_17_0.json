            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad)\n   Premise 2: Not Q (Kate did not eat salad)\n   Conclusion: Not P (Ben did not eat pasta)\n\n2. This form of argument is known as Modus Tollens, which is Latin for \"mode of denying.\"\n\n3. The logic behind Modus Tollens is:\n   If P implies Q, and Q is false, then P must also be false.\n\n4. Let's think about why this works:\n   - If the first premise (If P, then Q) is true, it means that whenever P occurs, Q must also occur.\n   - The second premise states that Q did not occur.\n   - Therefore, P could not have occurred, because if it had, Q would have occurred (according to the first premise).\n\n5. In this specific case:\n   - If Ben eating pasta implies Kate eating salad, and we know Kate didn't eat salad, then we can conclude that Ben didn't eat pasta.\n   - If Ben had eaten pasta, Kate would have had to eat salad (according to the first premise), but we know she didn't.\n\n6. This form of reasoning is considered logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. There's no way for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
