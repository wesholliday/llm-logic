            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the premise and conclusion:\n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false.\n\n4. Let's consider a scenario:\n   - Suppose Lisa didn't buy the red shirt (not P)\n   - The premise doesn't tell us anything about what happens if Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt\n   - It's possible that Mark could still have bought the blue shirt for reasons unrelated to Lisa's purchase\n\n5. In this scenario, the premise would still be true (because it only makes a claim about what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt), but the conclusion would be false (because Mark could have bought the blue shirt even though Lisa didn't buy the red shirt).\n\n6. Since we can construct a scenario where the premise is true but the conclusion is false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\n7. The premise only gives us information about what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt. It doesn't give us any information about what happens if Lisa doesn't buy the red shirt.\n\n8. To be logically valid, the conclusion would need to follow necessarily from the premise, which it doesn't in this case.\n\nAnswer: no"
