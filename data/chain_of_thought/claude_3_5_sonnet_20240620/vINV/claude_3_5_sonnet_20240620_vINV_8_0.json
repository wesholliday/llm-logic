            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n   Conclusion: If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake.\n\n2. In logical form, this can be written as:\n   Premise: P \u2192 Q\n   Conclusion: ~P \u2192 ~Q\n   (Where P is \"the vampire was awake\" and Q is \"the mummy was awake\")\n\n3. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or the inverse error.\n\n4. To be logically valid, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premise. Let's examine if this is the case:\n\n5. The premise (P \u2192 Q) only tells us what happens when P is true. It doesn't give us any information about what happens when P is false.\n\n6. The conclusion (~P \u2192 ~Q) makes a claim about what happens when P is false, but we don't have any information to support this from the premise.\n\n7. We can see this more clearly with a counterexample:\n   Let's say \"If it's raining, the ground is wet.\"\n   This doesn't mean \"If it's not raining, the ground is not wet.\"\n   The ground could be wet for other reasons (like a sprinkler).\n\n8. Similarly, in our vampire-mummy scenario, the mummy could be awake for reasons unrelated to the vampire's state.\n\n9. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
