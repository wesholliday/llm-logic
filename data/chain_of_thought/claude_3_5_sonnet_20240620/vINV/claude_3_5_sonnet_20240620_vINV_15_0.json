            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If P, then Q (where P = \"Sam took a plane\" and Q = \"Erin took a train\")\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider all possible scenarios:\n   a) Sam took a plane and Erin took a train (P and Q are true)\n   b) Sam took a plane and Erin didn't take a train (P is true, Q is false)\n   c) Sam didn't take a plane and Erin took a train (P is false, Q is true)\n   d) Sam didn't take a plane and Erin didn't take a train (P and Q are false)\n\n5. The premise \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" only rules out scenario b.\n\n6. The conclusion \"If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train\" is claiming that scenario c is impossible.\n\n7. However, scenario c doesn't contradict the premise. It's entirely possible that Erin took a train even if Sam didn't take a plane.\n\n8. Therefore, we can have a situation where the premise is true (ruling out only scenario b) but the conclusion is false (scenario c is possible).\n\n9. In formal logic, an argument is only valid if it's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n10. Since we've found a case where the premise can be true and the conclusion false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
