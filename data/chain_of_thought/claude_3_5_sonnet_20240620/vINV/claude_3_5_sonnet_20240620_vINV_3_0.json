            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n   Where P is \"the book was written by James\" and Q is \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider a scenario:\n   - The premise states that if James wrote the book, it's a mystery novel.\n   - But this doesn't mean that only James writes mystery novels.\n   - It's possible that other authors also write mystery novels.\n\n5. So, even if the book wasn't written by James (not P), it could still be a mystery novel (Q).\n\n6. This means that the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premise.\n\n7. For an argument to be logically valid, it must be impossible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n8. In this case, we've shown that it's possible for the premise to be true (If James wrote it, it's a mystery) and the conclusion to be false (a book not written by James could still be a mystery).\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
