            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the premise and conclusion:\n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premise to be true while the conclusion is false.\n\n4. Let's consider a scenario:\n   - Suppose the premise is true: \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\"\n   - Now, let's assume Tom did not watch football\n   - Does this necessarily mean Jen did not watch basketball? No, it doesn't.\n\n5. Jen could still have watched basketball for other reasons, regardless of Tom's football watching.\n\n6. The original premise only tells us what happens if Tom watches football. It doesn't give us any information about what happens if Tom doesn't watch football.\n\n7. Therefore, we can't logically conclude anything about Jen's basketball watching based solely on Tom not watching football.\n\n8. Since we can construct a scenario where the premise is true but the conclusion could be false, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
