            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If P, then Q (where P is \"the car was red\" and Q is \"the truck was blue\")\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider all possible scenarios:\n   a) The car is red and the truck is blue (premise true)\n   b) The car is red and the truck is not blue (premise false)\n   c) The car is not red and the truck is blue (premise true, conclusion false)\n   d) The car is not red and the truck is not blue (premise true, conclusion true)\n\n5. The key is scenario c. In this case, the premise \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is still true (because the antecedent is false, making the conditional statement true regardless of the consequent). However, the conclusion \"If the car was not red, then the truck was not blue\" is false.\n\n6. Since we've found a scenario where the premise can be true but the conclusion false, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
