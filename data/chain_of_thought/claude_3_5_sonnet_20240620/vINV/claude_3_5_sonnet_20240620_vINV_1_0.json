            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   Conclusion: If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\n\n2. We can represent this symbolically:\n   Premise: M \u2192 S\n   Conclusion: \u00acM \u2192 \u00acS\n   (Where M = \"Mary was at the wedding\" and S = \"Sue was at the wedding\")\n\n3. The conclusion is the contrapositive of the premise. However, the contrapositive of \"If M, then S\" is actually \"If not S, then not M\", not \"If not M, then not S\".\n\n4. To illustrate why this is not valid, let's consider a scenario:\n   - Suppose the premise is true: If Mary is at the wedding, Sue is definitely there.\n   - But this doesn't mean that Sue is only there if Mary is there. Sue could attend even if Mary doesn't.\n\n5. For example:\n   - Mary doesn't attend, but Sue does anyway. This doesn't contradict the premise, but it contradicts the conclusion.\n\n6. In formal logic, from \"M \u2192 S\", we can't conclude \"\u00acM \u2192 \u00acS\". This is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\n7. For an argument to be logically valid, it must be impossible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false. We've shown a case where this is possible, so the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
