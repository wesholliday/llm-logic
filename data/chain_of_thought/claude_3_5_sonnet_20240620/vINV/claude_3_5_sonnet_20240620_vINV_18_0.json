            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If P, then Q (where P = \"the doll was plastic\" and Q = \"the truck was metal\")\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider all possible scenarios:\n   a) The doll is plastic and the truck is metal (P and Q are true)\n   b) The doll is plastic and the truck is not metal (P is true, Q is false)\n   c) The doll is not plastic and the truck is metal (P is false, Q is true)\n   d) The doll is not plastic and the truck is not metal (P and Q are false)\n\n5. The premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" only rules out scenario b. It says nothing about scenarios c and d.\n\n6. The conclusion \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" eliminates scenario c.\n\n7. However, scenario c is perfectly consistent with the premise. The premise doesn't say anything about what happens when the doll is not plastic.\n\n8. Therefore, it's possible for the premise to be true (ruling out only scenario b) while the conclusion is false (because scenario c is possible).\n\n9. In formal logic, an argument is only valid if it's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n10. Since we've found a case where the premise can be true and the conclusion false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
