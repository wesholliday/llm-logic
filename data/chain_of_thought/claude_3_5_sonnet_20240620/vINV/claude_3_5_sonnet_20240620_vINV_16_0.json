            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If P, then Q (where P = \"the shirt was cotton\" and Q = \"the pants were denim\")\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider all possible scenarios:\n   a) The shirt is cotton and the pants are denim (P and Q are true)\n   b) The shirt is cotton and the pants are not denim (P is true, Q is false)\n   c) The shirt is not cotton and the pants are denim (P is false, Q is true)\n   d) The shirt is not cotton and the pants are not denim (P and Q are false)\n\n5. The premise \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" only rules out scenario b. It allows for scenarios a, c, and d.\n\n6. The conclusion \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" rules out scenario c.\n\n7. However, scenario c is perfectly consistent with the premise. The premise doesn't say anything about what happens when the shirt is not cotton.\n\n8. Therefore, it's possible for the premise to be true (ruling out only scenario b) while the conclusion is false (because scenario c is possible).\n\n9. For an argument to be logically valid, it must be impossible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false. We've shown that this is possible here.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
