            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If P, then Q (where P is \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q is \"Amy played tennis\")\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider all possible scenarios:\n   a) Jeff played basketball and Amy played tennis (P and Q are true)\n   b) Jeff played basketball and Amy didn't play tennis (P is true, Q is false)\n   c) Jeff didn't play basketball and Amy played tennis (P is false, Q is true)\n   d) Jeff didn't play basketball and Amy didn't play tennis (P and Q are false)\n\n5. The premise \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" only rules out scenario b.\n\n6. The conclusion \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" is only true in scenario d.\n\n7. Crucially, scenario c (Jeff didn't play basketball, but Amy did play tennis) doesn't contradict the premise, but it does contradict the conclusion.\n\n8. This means it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false, which is the definition of an invalid argument.\n\nAnswer: no"
