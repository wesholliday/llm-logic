            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If P, then Q (where P is \"Joe went to the park\" and Q is \"Lucy went to the zoo\")\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider all possible scenarios:\n   a) Joe went to the park and Lucy went to the zoo (P and Q are true)\n   b) Joe went to the park and Lucy didn't go to the zoo (P is true, Q is false)\n   c) Joe didn't go to the park and Lucy went to the zoo (P is false, Q is true)\n   d) Joe didn't go to the park and Lucy didn't go to the zoo (P and Q are false)\n\n5. The premise \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" only rules out scenario b.\n\n6. The conclusion \"If Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo\" is equivalent to saying that scenario c is impossible.\n\n7. However, scenario c doesn't contradict the premise. It's entirely possible that Lucy went to the zoo even if Joe didn't go to the park.\n\n8. Therefore, we can have a situation where the premise is true (ruling out only scenario b) but the conclusion is false (scenario c is possible).\n\n9. Since it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false, this argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
