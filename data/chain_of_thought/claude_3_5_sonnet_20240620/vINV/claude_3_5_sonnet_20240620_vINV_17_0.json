            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If P, then Q (where P is \"Ben ate pasta\" and Q is \"Kate ate salad\")\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider all possible scenarios:\n   a) Ben ate pasta and Kate ate salad (P and Q are true)\n   b) Ben ate pasta and Kate didn't eat salad (P is true, Q is false)\n   c) Ben didn't eat pasta and Kate ate salad (P is false, Q is true)\n   d) Ben didn't eat pasta and Kate didn't eat salad (P and Q are false)\n\n5. The premise \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" only rules out scenario b. It allows for scenarios a, c, and d.\n\n6. The conclusion \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" is only true in scenario d, but not in scenario c.\n\n7. Therefore, it's possible for the premise to be true (allowing scenarios a, c, and d) while the conclusion is false (scenario c contradicts it).\n\n8. For an argument to be logically valid, there must be no possible situation where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. We've found such a situation here.\n\nTherefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
