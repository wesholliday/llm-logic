            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If A, then B\n   Conclusion: If not A, then not B\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider all possible scenarios:\n   - The apple is red and the banana is yellow (premise true, conclusion not applicable)\n   - The apple is red and the banana is not yellow (premise false, conclusion not applicable)\n   - The apple is not red and the banana is yellow (premise not applicable, conclusion false)\n   - The apple is not red and the banana is not yellow (premise not applicable, conclusion true)\n\n4. For an argument to be logically valid, it must be impossible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n5. In this case, we can see that it's possible for the premise to be true (apple is red, banana is yellow) while the conclusion is false (apple is not red, but banana is still yellow).\n\n6. This means that the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.\n\n7. Therefore, this form of argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
