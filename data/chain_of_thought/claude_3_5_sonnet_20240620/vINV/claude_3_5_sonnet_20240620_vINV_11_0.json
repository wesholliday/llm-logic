            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of the argument:\n   Premise: If P, then Q\n   Conclusion: If not P, then not Q\n\n   Where P is \"the cake was chocolate\" and Q is \"the muffins were blueberry\"\n\n2. This form of argument is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent or inverse error.\n\n3. To determine if it's logically valid, we need to consider if it's possible for the premise to be true and the conclusion false.\n\n4. Let's consider all possible scenarios:\n   a) The cake is chocolate and the muffins are blueberry (P and Q are true)\n   b) The cake is chocolate and the muffins are not blueberry (P is true, Q is false)\n   c) The cake is not chocolate and the muffins are blueberry (P is false, Q is true)\n   d) The cake is not chocolate and the muffins are not blueberry (P and Q are false)\n\n5. The premise \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" only rules out scenario b.\n\n6. The conclusion \"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry\" rules out scenario c.\n\n7. However, scenario c is still possible given the premise. The premise doesn't say anything about what happens when the cake is not chocolate.\n\n8. Since it's possible for the premise to be true (ruling out only scenario b) while the conclusion is false (scenario c is still possible), this argument form is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: no"
