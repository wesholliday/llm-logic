            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The meeting might be cancelled.\"\n2. This statement indicates uncertainty about the meeting's status, specifically mentioning the possibility of cancellation.\n3. The statement we're asked to infer is \"The meeting might be scheduled or cancelled.\"\n4. This new statement also expresses uncertainty, but it presents two possibilities: scheduling or cancellation.\n5. The original statement only mentions cancellation as a possibility, not scheduling.\n6. However, for a meeting to be potentially cancelled, it must first be scheduled or at least planned.\n7. Therefore, the original statement implicitly assumes that the meeting was initially scheduled or planned.\n8. The new statement simply makes this implicit assumption explicit by mentioning both possibilities.\n9. By stating that the meeting \"might be cancelled,\" the original statement leaves open the possibility that it might not be cancelled, which is equivalent to saying it might remain scheduled.\n10. Thus, the new statement is a logical expansion of the possibilities implied in the original statement.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that the second statement can be inferred from the first, as it merely makes explicit what was already implied.\n\nAnswer: yes"
