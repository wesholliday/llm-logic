            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The computer might be broken.\"\n2. This statement expresses uncertainty about the computer's condition, specifically suggesting the possibility that it is broken.\n3. The statement we're asked to infer is \"The computer might be working or broken.\"\n4. This new statement also expresses uncertainty, but it covers both possible states: working or broken.\n5. The original statement only mentions the possibility of being broken, while the inferred statement includes both possibilities.\n6. In logic, when we have a statement that says \"A might be true,\" it doesn't exclude the possibility that \"A might not be true.\"\n7. Therefore, saying \"The computer might be broken\" doesn't rule out the possibility that it might be working.\n8. The inferred statement is actually a more comprehensive description of the possible states, including both the original possibility (broken) and its alternative (working).\n9. Since the inferred statement encompasses the original statement and doesn't contradict it, we can logically infer it from the original.\n\nAnswer: yes"
