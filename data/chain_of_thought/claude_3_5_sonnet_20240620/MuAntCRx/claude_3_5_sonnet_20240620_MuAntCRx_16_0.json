The proposed inference is \"The grooble must snork wozzle grooble and frazzle quibble wibble.\"\n3. The original statement makes a claim about what the grooble must do: it must \"frazzle quibble wibble.\"\n4. The proposed inference includes the original statement entirely, but also adds additional actions: \"snork wozzle grooble and.\"\n5. We cannot logically infer that the grooble must perform these additional actions based solely on the information given in the original statement.\n6. The original statement does not provide any information about \"snork,\" \"wozzle,\" or the grooble performing actions on itself.\n7. Adding these extra actions goes beyond the scope of the original statement and introduces new information that is not supported by the given premise.\n8. In logical inference, we cannot add new information or make assumptions beyond what is explicitly stated or directly implied by the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the proposed statement from the original one, as it contains additional unsupported claims.\n\nAnswer: no"
