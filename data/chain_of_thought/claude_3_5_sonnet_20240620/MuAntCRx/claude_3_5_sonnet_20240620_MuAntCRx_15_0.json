This statement only specifies one action that the zibble must do: glorp a flonk.\n3. The inferred statement adds an additional action: \"grooble a quazzle.\"\n4. There is no information in the original statement about groobling a quazzle.\n5. We cannot assume or infer additional actions or requirements that are not present in the original statement.\n6. The inferred statement does include the original action (glorp a flonk), but it adds an extra action that we have no basis for including.\n7. In logical reasoning, we cannot add new information or requirements that are not supported by the given premises.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer the second statement from the first one because it contains additional information not present in or implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
