We are asked if we can infer \"The plonk must zibber for and be shimble for\" from this.\n\n3. The original statement only mentions that the plonk must \"be shimble for.\"\n\n4. The proposed inference adds a new requirement: \"zibber for.\"\n\n5. There is no information in the original statement about \"zibber for\" or any other requirement besides \"be shimble for.\"\n\n6. We cannot add new information or requirements that are not present in or logically derived from the original statement.\n\n7. While the second part of the proposed inference (\"be shimble for\") is present in the original statement, the first part (\"zibber for\") is not.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot infer the proposed statement from the original one, as it contains additional information not present in or logically derived from the original.\n\nAnswer: no"
