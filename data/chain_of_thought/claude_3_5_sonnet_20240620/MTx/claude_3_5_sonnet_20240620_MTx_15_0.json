            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\n   b) The dreb was not spened.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The dreb was vroombed\n   B: The dreb was spened\n\n3. The second statement negates B: The dreb was not spened.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent.\" It follows this structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If the dreb was vroombed (P), then the dreb was spened (Q)\n   The dreb was not spened (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the dreb was not vroombed (Not P)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. If we know that the dreb being vroombed always leads to it being spened, and we know it wasn't spened, then we can conclude it wasn't vroombed.\n\nAnswer: yes"
