            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n   b) The zinger was not smoogled.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\" where:\n   A = \"the zinger was fraggled\"\n   B = \"the zinger was smoogled\"\n\n3. The second statement directly negates B, stating that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as modus tollens (denying the consequent). The general form is:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our specific case:\n   If the zinger was fraggled (P), then the zinger was smoogled (Q)\n   The zinger was not smoogled (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the zinger was not fraggled (Not P)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. If the zinger being fraggled always leads to it being smoogled, and we know it wasn't smoogled, then it couldn't have been fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
