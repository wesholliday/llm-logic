            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked.\n   b) The fribble did not crink.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The fribble was snurgled\n   B: The fribble crinked\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: The fribble did not crink.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent.\" It follows this structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If the fribble was snurgled (P), then the fribble crinked (Q)\n   The fribble did not crink (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the fribble was not snurgled (Not P)\n\n6. This is a valid logical inference. If the conditional statement is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
