            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n   b) The twonk was not varnished.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\":\n   P: The twonk was plinked\n   Q: The twonk was varnished\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q: The twonk was not varnished.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). The general form is:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our specific case:\n   If the twonk was plinked (P), then it was varnished (Q)\n   The twonk was not varnished (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the twonk was not plinked (Not P)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. If the twonk had been plinked, it would have been varnished according to the first statement. But we know it wasn't varnished, so it couldn't have been plinked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
