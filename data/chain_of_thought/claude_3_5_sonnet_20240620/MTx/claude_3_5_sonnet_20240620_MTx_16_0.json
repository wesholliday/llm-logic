            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\n   b) The sneg did not sproted the frink.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The sneg was crampled\n   B: The sneg sproted the frink\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: The sneg did NOT sproted the frink.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as modus tollens (denying the consequent). The structure is:\n   If A, then B\n   Not B\n   Therefore, not A\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If the sneg was crampled (A), then the sneg sproted the frink (B)\n   The sneg did not sproted the frink (Not B)\n   Therefore, the sneg was not crampled (Not A)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. When we know that a conditional statement is true, and we also know that its consequent (the \"then\" part) is false, we can conclude that its antecedent (the \"if\" part) must also be false.\n\nAnswer: yes"
