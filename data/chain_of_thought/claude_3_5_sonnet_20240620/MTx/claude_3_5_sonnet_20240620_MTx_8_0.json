            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n   b) The sprocket was not daggled.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the sprocket was cranked\"\n   B = \"the sprocket was daggled\"\n\n3. The second statement directly negates B, stating that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is a classic example of the logical rule called \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent\". This rule states that if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false.\n\n5. Applying this rule to our scenario:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\"\n   - We know that B is false (the sprocket was not daggled)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that A must also be false (the sprocket was not cranked)\n\n6. This logical deduction is valid regardless of the specific meanings of \"cranked\" or \"daggled\". The structure of the argument itself leads to the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
