            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled.\n   b) The wug was not garpled.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the wug was sproinged\"\n   B = \"it was garpled\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"The wug was not garpled.\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, Not P\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If A \u2192 B (If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled)\n   Not B (The wug was not garpled)\n   Therefore, Not A (The wug was not sproinged)\n\n6. The logic works as follows: If being sproinged always leads to being garpled, and we know for certain that the wug was not garpled, then it couldn't have been sproinged. If it had been sproinged, it would have been garpled, which contradicts our second given statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
