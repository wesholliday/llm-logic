We have two statements:\n   a) If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint.\n   b) The smip did not lup the zoint.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The smip was shripped\n   B: The smip lupped the zoint\n\n3. The second statement directly contradicts B. It states that B is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. The reasoning behind this is:\n   - If A were true, then B would have to be true (according to the conditional statement).\n   - But we know B is false.\n   - Therefore, A cannot be true; it must be false.\n\n6. Applying this to our specific case:\n   - If \"the smip was shripped\" were true, then \"the smip lupped the zoint\" would have to be true.\n   - But we know \"the smip did not lup the zoint\".\n   - Therefore, \"the smip was not shripped\" must be true.\n\n7. This is exactly what we're being asked to infer, so the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
