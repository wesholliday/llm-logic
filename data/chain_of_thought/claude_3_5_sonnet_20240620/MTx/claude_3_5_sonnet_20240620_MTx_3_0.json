            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\n   b) The splat did not quank.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the splat was morphed\"\n   B = \"the splat quanked\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"The splat did not quank\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens (denying the consequent). The general form is:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our specific case:\n   If the splat was morphed (P), then the splat quanked (Q)\n   The splat did not quank (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the splat was not morphed (Not P)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. If the conditional statement is true and the consequent (quanking) is false, then the antecedent (being morphed) must also be false.\n\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The splat was not morphed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
