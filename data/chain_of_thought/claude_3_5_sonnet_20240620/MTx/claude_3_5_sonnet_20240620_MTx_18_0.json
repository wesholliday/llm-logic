            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n   b) The shank was not nugged.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"the shank was plooked\"\n   Q = \"the shank was nugged\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q: \"The shank was not nugged\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is a valid form of argument known as \"Modus Tollens\" or \"denying the consequent.\" It states that if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false.\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   - We know that if the shank was plooked (P), then it would be nugged (Q).\n   - We also know that the shank was not nugged (not Q).\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that the shank was not plooked (not P).\n\n6. This conclusion is logically valid because if the shank had been plooked, it would necessarily have been nugged according to the first statement. Since we know it wasn't nugged, it couldn't have been plooked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
