            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\n   b) The whiffle did not tink.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The whiffle was shanked\n   B: The whiffle tinked\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: The whiffle did not tink.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is a classic example of the logical rule called \"Modus Tollens\" (denying the consequent). The structure is:\n   If A, then B\n   Not B\n   Therefore, not A\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If the whiffle was shanked (A), then the whiffle tinked (B)\n   The whiffle did not tink (Not B)\n   Therefore, the whiffle was not shanked (Not A)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. If we assume that when the whiffle is shanked, it always tinks, and we observe that it didn't tink, we can conclude that it wasn't shanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
