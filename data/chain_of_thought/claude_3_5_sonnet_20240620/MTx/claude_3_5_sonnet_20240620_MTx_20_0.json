            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\"\n   b) \"The fleeg did not surn\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the fleeg was bluttered\"\n   B = \"it surned\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"The fleeg did not surn\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which follows this structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If the fleeg was bluttered (P), then it surned (Q)\n   The fleeg did not surn (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the fleeg was not bluttered (Not P)\n\n6. The Modus Tollens is a valid logical argument form. If the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\n7. Therefore, from the given statements, we can logically infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
