            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\n   b) The clug did not snugged.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The clug was fleeked\n   B: The clug snugged\n\n3. The second statement negates B: The clug did not snugged.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent.\" It follows this structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If the clug was fleeked (P), then the clug snugged (Q)\n   The clug did not snugged (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the clug was not fleeked (Not P)\n\n6. This is a valid logical inference. If the conditional statement is true, and the consequent (Q) is false, then the antecedent (P) must also be false.\n\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The clug was not fleeked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
