            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\n   b) The wug did not bim the zoint.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The wug was flooped\n   B: The wug bimmed the zoint\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: The wug did not bim the zoint.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is a valid form of argument known as \"modus tollens\" or \"denying the consequent.\" It follows this structure:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If the wug was flooped (P), then the wug bimmed the zoint (Q)\n   The wug did not bim the zoint (Not Q)\n   Therefore, the wug was not flooped (Not P)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid. When we know that a conditional statement is true (If A, then B) and we also know that B is false, we can conclude that A must be false as well.\n\nAnswer: yes"
