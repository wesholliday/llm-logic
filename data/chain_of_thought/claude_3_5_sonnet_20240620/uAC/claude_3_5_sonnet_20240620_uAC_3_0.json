            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   b) The book is a mystery novel.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The book was written by James\n   B: The book is a mystery novel\n\n3. The second statement confirms that B is true (the book is indeed a mystery novel).\n\n4. However, we cannot automatically conclude that A is true just because B is true. This is a common logical fallacy known as \"affirming the consequent.\"\n\n5. To illustrate why this doesn't work, consider this example:\n   If it's raining, then the ground is wet.\n   The ground is wet.\n   Can we conclude that it's raining? No, because the ground could be wet for other reasons (like a sprinkler).\n\n6. Similarly, in our case, while James writing the book would result in it being a mystery novel, there could be other authors who also write mystery novels.\n\n7. The given information only tells us that James' books are always mystery novels, not that all mystery novels are written by James.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that James wrote the book.\n\nAnswer: no"
