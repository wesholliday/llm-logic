            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". This means that if Mary was at the wedding (A), it guarantees that Sue was at the wedding (B).\n\n3. However, it's important to note that this conditional statement doesn't work in reverse. It doesn't say \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\n4. The second piece of information tells us that Sue was indeed at the wedding.\n\n5. While we know Sue was at the wedding, we can't use this information to definitively conclude anything about Mary's presence.\n\n6. This is because the original statement only tells us what happens if Mary is there, not what happens if Sue is there.\n\n7. In logical terms, we can affirm the consequent (Sue was at the wedding), but this doesn't allow us to conclude anything about the antecedent (Mary being at the wedding).\n\n8. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether Mary was at the wedding or not. She might have been there, or she might not have been there - we simply don't have enough information to know for certain.\n\nAnswer: no"
