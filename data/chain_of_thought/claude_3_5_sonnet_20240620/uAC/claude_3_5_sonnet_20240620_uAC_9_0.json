            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". This doesn't necessarily mean that if B is true, A must be true.\n\n3. We know that Mark bought the blue shirt (B is true), but this doesn't automatically mean that Lisa bought the red shirt (A).\n\n4. This is a common logical fallacy called \"affirming the consequent\". Just because the consequent (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true, it doesn't necessarily mean the antecedent (Lisa bought the red shirt) is true.\n\n5. For example, it's possible that Mark bought the blue shirt for reasons unrelated to Lisa's purchase, or perhaps someone else bought the red shirt.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us what happens if Lisa buys the red shirt, but it doesn't say anything about what happens if she doesn't buy it.\n\n7. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: no"
