            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n\n2. This statement is negating the necessity of Sue choosing pizza. In other words, it's saying that it's not absolutely certain or required that Sue chose pizza.\n\n3. If something is not necessary, it means there are other possibilities.\n\n4. In modal logic, \"must\" is equivalent to necessity, while \"might\" refers to possibility.\n\n5. By negating \"must,\" we are essentially saying that it's not necessarily true that Sue chose pizza.\n\n6. If it's not necessarily true, then there must be a possibility that it's false.\n\n7. The statement \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" expresses exactly this possibility - that there's a chance Sue did not choose pizza.\n\n8. The original statement and the inferred statement are logically equivalent. They both express the idea that Sue choosing pizza is not a certainty.\n\n9. Therefore, we can indeed infer \"Sue might not have chosen pizza\" from \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
