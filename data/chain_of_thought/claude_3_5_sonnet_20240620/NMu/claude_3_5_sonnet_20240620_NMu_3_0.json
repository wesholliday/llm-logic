            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\"\n\n2. This statement is negating the necessity of James being the author. In other words, it's saying that it's not absolutely certain or required that James wrote the book.\n\n3. In modal logic, \"must\" represents necessity, while \"might\" represents possibility.\n\n4. If something is not necessary, it means there's a possibility of it not being the case.\n\n5. Therefore, if it's not necessary that James wrote the book, it implies that there's a possibility that James did not write the book.\n\n6. The statement \"The book might not have been written by James\" expresses exactly this possibility.\n\n7. \"Might not\" is logically equivalent to \"not must,\" which is what the original statement conveys.\n\n8. Thus, the second statement is a logical inference from the first statement. It's essentially rephrasing the same idea in terms of possibility rather than necessity.\n\nAnswer: yes"
