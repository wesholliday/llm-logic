            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\"\n\n2. This statement is negating the necessity of Lisa buying the red shirt. In other words, it's saying that it's not absolutely certain or required that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n3. If something is not necessary, it means there's a possibility that it didn't happen.\n\n4. In modal logic, \"not necessary\" is equivalent to \"possibly not.\" This is because if something is not necessary, there must be at least one possible scenario where it doesn't occur.\n\n5. The phrase \"might not have\" expresses possibility of something not happening, which aligns with our interpretation of the original statement.\n\n6. Therefore, saying \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" is a valid inference from the original statement. It accurately captures the uncertainty expressed in the original sentence.\n\n7. Both statements leave open the possibility that Lisa did buy the red shirt, but they also allow for the possibility that she didn't.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: yes"
