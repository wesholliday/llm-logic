            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\"\n\n2. This statement is negating the necessity of the toy being in the toy box. In other words, it's saying that it's not absolutely required for the toy to be in the toy box.\n\n3. If something is not necessary, it means there are other possibilities.\n\n4. In this case, if it's not necessary for the toy to be in the toy box, it implies that there's a possibility that the toy could be somewhere else.\n\n5. The statement \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" expresses exactly this possibility - that there's a chance the toy is not in the toy box.\n\n6. The original statement and the inferred statement are logically equivalent. The first denies the necessity of the toy being in the box, while the second affirms the possibility of the toy not being in the box.\n\n7. In modal logic, these statements are indeed equivalent. The negation of \"must\" (necessity) is equivalent to the possibility of the negation.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" from \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
