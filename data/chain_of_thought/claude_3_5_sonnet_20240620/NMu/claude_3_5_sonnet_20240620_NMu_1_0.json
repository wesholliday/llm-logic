            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\n\n2. This statement is negating the necessity of Mary's presence at the wedding.\n\n3. In modal logic, \"must\" represents necessity, while \"might\" represents possibility.\n\n4. The negation of necessity (\"not must\") is equivalent to the possibility of the negation (\"might not\").\n\n5. To understand this better, let's consider the possible scenarios:\n   - If Mary must have been at the wedding, there's no possibility she wasn't there.\n   - If it's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding, it opens up the possibility that she might not have been there.\n\n6. By saying it's not necessary that Mary was at the wedding, we're implying that there's a possibility she wasn't there.\n\n7. Therefore, \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" logically implies \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
