            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\"\n\n2. This statement is negating the necessity of the sunglasses being in her bag.\n\n3. If something is not necessary, it means it's possible for it to not be the case.\n\n4. In logical terms, we're moving from \"not necessarily p\" to \"possibly not p.\"\n\n5. \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag\" means that there's a possibility that the sunglasses are not in her bag.\n\n6. The statement \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\" is expressing exactly this possibility.\n\n7. Both statements are essentially saying the same thing, just phrased differently.\n\n8. The first statement rules out the necessity of the sunglasses being in the bag, while the second statement directly asserts the possibility of them not being there.\n\n9. These are logically equivalent statements.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"The sunglasses might not be in her bag\" from \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
