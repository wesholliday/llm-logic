            "content": "Explanation: Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given statement is \"The document must have been signed.\"\n2. We are asked if we can infer \"The document must have been signed and notarized.\"\n3. The original statement only mentions signing, not notarization.\n4. Notarization is a separate process from signing. It involves a notary public witnessing the signature and certifying the document.\n5. While many documents that are signed are also notarized, this is not always the case. Many documents only require a signature without notarization.\n6. The original statement does not provide any information about notarization.\n7. Adding the requirement of notarization to the original statement would be introducing new information that is not implied by the original statement.\n8. In logical inference, we cannot add new information that is not explicitly stated or necessarily implied by the given information.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the document must have been notarized based solely on the information that it must have been signed. The inference adds a condition (notarization) that is not present in or necessarily implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
