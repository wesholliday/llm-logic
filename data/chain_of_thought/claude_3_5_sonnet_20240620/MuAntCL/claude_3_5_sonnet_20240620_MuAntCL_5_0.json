            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The package must have been delivered yesterday.\"\n\n2. The inference we're asked about adds an additional element: \"and signed for.\"\n\n3. The word \"must\" in the original statement indicates a high degree of certainty about the delivery, but only about the delivery itself.\n\n4. The original statement does not provide any information about whether the package was signed for or not.\n\n5. While it's common for packages to be signed for upon delivery, this is not always the case. Some deliveries can be left without a signature, depending on the sender's instructions or the delivery company's policies.\n\n6. Adding \"and signed for\" to the statement introduces new information that is not present in or necessarily implied by the original statement.\n\n7. We cannot logically infer additional details that are not explicitly stated or directly implied by the given information.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot conclude with certainty that the package was signed for based solely on the information that it must have been delivered.\n\nAnswer: no"
