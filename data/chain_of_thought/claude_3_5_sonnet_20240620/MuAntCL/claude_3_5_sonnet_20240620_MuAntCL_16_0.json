            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The given statement is: \"The room must have been cleaned daily.\"\n\n2. This statement only provides information about the cleaning frequency of the room.\n\n3. It does not mention anything about towels or any other specific cleaning tasks.\n\n4. The inference we're asked about adds a new piece of information: \"and had fresh towels.\"\n\n5. While it's possible that fresh towels might be part of a daily cleaning routine in some establishments, this is not a universal practice and cannot be automatically assumed.\n\n6. More importantly, the original statement does not provide any information about towels at all.\n\n7. In logical reasoning, we cannot infer additional information that is not explicitly stated or directly implied by the given information.\n\n8. Adding the part about fresh towels goes beyond the scope of the original statement and introduces new information that we cannot verify based solely on the given statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the expanded statement from the original one, as it includes additional information not present in or directly implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
