            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The concert must have been sold out.\"\n2. The proposed inference adds additional information: \"and started at 8 PM.\"\n3. In logical terms, we're looking at whether A (concert sold out) implies A AND B (concert sold out AND started at 8 PM).\n4. The original statement only provides information about the concert being sold out. It doesn't give any information about the start time.\n5. Adding the start time of 8 PM is introducing new information that wasn't present or implied in the original statement.\n6. In logic, we can't infer a more specific statement from a more general one without additional information.\n7. While it's possible that the concert did start at 8 PM, we can't infer this from the given statement alone.\n8. The proposed inference is more restrictive than the original statement, as it requires both conditions to be true.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer the second statement from the first one, as it contains additional information not present in or implied by the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
