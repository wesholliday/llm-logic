The original statement is: \"The application must have been completed online.\"\n2. The statement we're trying to infer is: \"The application must have been completed online and included references.\"\n\nLet's break this down:\n\n3. The first part of both statements is identical: \"The application must have been completed online.\"\n4. The second statement adds an additional requirement: \"and included references.\"\n5. The original statement does not mention anything about references.\n6. We cannot assume that all online applications require references.\n7. The original statement only specifies the method of completion (online) and does not provide any information about the content or requirements of the application.\n8. Adding the requirement of references is introducing new information that is not present or implied in the original statement.\n\nTherefore, we cannot logically infer that the application must have included references based solely on the information that it was completed online. The second statement is more specific and includes additional requirements not mentioned in the original statement.\n\nAnswer: no"
