            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\"\n   b) \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat must have quanked\"\n\n2. Let's break down the first statement:\n   - \"It's not the case that the splat must have quanked\" means that it's possible the splat did not quank.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the second statement:\n   - This is a conditional statement: If A, then B\n   - A: \"the splat was morphed\"\n   - B: \"the splat must have quanked\"\n\n4. In logic, if we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens.\n\n5. In our case:\n   - We know from the first statement that B (the splat must have quanked) is not necessarily true.\n   - The second statement tells us that if A is true, then B must be true.\n   - Since B is not necessarily true, A cannot be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that the splat was not morphed. If it had been morphed, it would have had to quank, but we know it's not necessarily the case that it quanked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
