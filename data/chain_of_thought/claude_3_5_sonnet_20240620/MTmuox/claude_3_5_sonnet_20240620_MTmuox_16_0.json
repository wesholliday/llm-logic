            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink\"\n   b) \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg must have sproted the frink\"\n\n2. Let's simplify statement (a):\n   - It means that it's possible that the sneg did not sprot the frink.\n\n3. Statement (b) is a conditional statement. It can be read as:\n   - If A (the sneg was crampled), then B (the sneg must have sproted the frink)\n\n4. Now, let's consider the logical structure:\n   - We know that B is not necessarily true (from statement a)\n   - We also know that if A is true, then B must be true (from statement b)\n\n5. Using the logical rule of modus tollens:\n   - If A implies B, and B is false, then A must be false.\n   - In this case, we know that if A (the sneg was crampled) were true, then B (the sneg must have sproted the frink) would have to be true.\n   - But we know from statement (a) that B is not necessarily true.\n\n6. Therefore, A (the sneg was crampled) cannot be true.\n\n7. This means that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The sneg was not crampled\" from the two given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
