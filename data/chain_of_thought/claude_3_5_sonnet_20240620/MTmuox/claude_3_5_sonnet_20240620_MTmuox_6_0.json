            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the grommet must have plopped the frink\"\n   b) \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet must have plopped the frink\"\n\n2. Let's simplify statement (a):\n   \"The grommet did not necessarily plop the frink\"\n\n3. Statement (b) is a conditional statement. It can be written as:\n   \"grommet was sploffed\" \u2192 \"grommet must have plopped the frink\"\n\n4. Now, let's consider the logical structure. We have:\n   - The consequent of the conditional statement (b) is negated in statement (a)\n   - We're asked if we can conclude the negation of the antecedent of (b)\n\n5. This logical structure is known as modus tollens:\n   If P \u2192 Q, and not Q, then we can conclude not P\n\n6. In our case:\n   P: \"The grommet was sploffed\"\n   Q: \"The grommet must have plopped the frink\"\n\n7. We know not Q from statement (a), and we have P \u2192 Q from statement (b)\n\n8. Therefore, we can logically conclude not P, which is \"The grommet was not sploffed\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
