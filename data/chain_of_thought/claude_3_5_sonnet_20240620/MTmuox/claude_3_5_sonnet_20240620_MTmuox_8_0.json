            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"It's not the case that the sprocket must have been daggled\"\n   b) \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket must have been daggled\"\n\n2. Let's simplify statement (a):\n   - It means that the sprocket being daggled is not a necessity or requirement.\n   - In other words, it's possible that the sprocket was not daggled.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement (b):\n   - This is a conditional statement: If A, then B\n   - Where A is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and B is \"the sprocket must have been daggled\"\n\n4. Combining the information from (a) and (b):\n   - We know that it's not necessary for the sprocket to have been daggled (from a)\n   - But if it was cranked, it must have been daggled (from b)\n\n5. Using logical deduction:\n   - If the sprocket was cranked, it must have been daggled (from b)\n   - But we know it's not necessary for it to have been daggled (from a)\n   - The only way for both these statements to be true is if the sprocket was not cranked\n\n6. This is an example of modus tollens:\n   - If P, then Q\n   - Not Q\n   - Therefore, not P\n\nIn this case:\n   - If cranked (P), then must be daggled (Q)\n   - It's not the case that it must be daggled (not Q)\n   - Therefore, it was not cranked (not P)\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The sprocket was not cranked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
