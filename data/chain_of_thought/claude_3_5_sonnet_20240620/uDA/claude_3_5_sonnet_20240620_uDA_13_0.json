            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n   b) The car was not red.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the car was red\"\n   B = \"the truck was blue\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false (the car was not red).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider these possibilities:\n   - The car could be any color other than red, and the truck could be blue.\n   - The car could be any color other than red, and the truck could be any color other than blue.\n\n6. Both of these possibilities are consistent with the given information. Therefore, we cannot determine whether the truck is blue or not based solely on the information provided.\n\n7. This logical principle is often referred to as the \"fallacy of denying the antecedent.\" We cannot infer the falsity of the consequent (B) from the falsity of the antecedent (A) in a conditional statement.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we cannot infer that the truck was not blue. We simply don't have enough information to determine the color of the truck.\n\nAnswer: no"
