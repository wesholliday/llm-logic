            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n   b) The apple was not red.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the apple was red\"\n   B = \"the banana was yellow\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false (the apple was not red).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. This type of logical fallacy is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because the \"if\" part (antecedent) is false, we can't conclude anything about the \"then\" part (consequent).\n\n6. The banana could still be yellow for other reasons, or it could be not yellow. We simply don't have enough information to determine the color of the banana based on the given statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that the banana was not yellow from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
