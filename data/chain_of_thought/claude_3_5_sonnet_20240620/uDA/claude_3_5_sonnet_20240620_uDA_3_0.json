            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   b) The book was not written by James.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the book was written by James\"\n   B = \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider the following possibilities:\n   - The book could still be a mystery novel, even though James didn't write it (someone else could have written a mystery novel).\n   - The book could be a non-mystery novel.\n\n6. The information given doesn't allow us to determine which of these possibilities is true.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot infer that the book is not a mystery novel based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
