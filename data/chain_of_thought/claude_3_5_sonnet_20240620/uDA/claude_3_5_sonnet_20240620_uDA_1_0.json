            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement: If A, then B. In this case:\n   A = Mary was at the wedding\n   B = Sue was at the wedding\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false (Mary was not at the wedding).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider these possibilities:\n   - Mary could be absent and Sue could be absent\n   - Mary could be absent and Sue could be present\n\n6. Both of these scenarios are consistent with the given information. The conditional statement doesn't say anything about Sue's presence when Mary is absent.\n\n7. Therefore, we don't have enough information to determine whether Sue was at the wedding or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
