            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B: Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider these possibilities:\n   - Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, and Mark bought the blue shirt\n   - Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, and Mark didn't buy the blue shirt\n\n   Both of these scenarios are consistent with the given information.\n\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer whether Mark bought the blue shirt or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
