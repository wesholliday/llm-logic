We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\n   b) Alex did not finish the race.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = Alex finished the race\n   B = Chris finished the race\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false (Alex did not finish the race).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider these possibilities:\n   - Alex didn't finish, and Chris didn't finish (possible)\n   - Alex didn't finish, but Chris did finish (also possible)\n\n6. The given information doesn't eliminate either of these possibilities.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot infer whether Chris finished the race or not based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
