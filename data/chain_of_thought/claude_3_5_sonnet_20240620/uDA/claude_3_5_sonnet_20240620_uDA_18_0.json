            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n   b) The doll was not plastic.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the doll was plastic\"\n   B = \"the truck was metal\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false (the doll was not plastic).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. This logical principle is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because the antecedent (A) is false, we can't determine whether the consequent (B) is true or false.\n\n6. In this specific case, even though the doll is not plastic, the truck could still be metal for other reasons. The conditional statement doesn't provide any information about the truck's material when the doll is not plastic.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot infer that the truck was not metal based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
