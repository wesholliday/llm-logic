            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n   b) The shirt was not cotton.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The shirt was cotton\n   B: The pants were denim\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false (the shirt was not cotton).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. This type of reasoning is called the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because the antecedent (A) is false, we can't conclude anything about the consequent (B).\n\n6. In this specific case, even though the shirt is not cotton, the pants could still be denim or they might not be. We simply don't have enough information to determine the material of the pants.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that the pants were not denim. We can't make any conclusion about the pants material.\n\nAnswer: no"
