            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\n   b) The cake was not chocolate.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The cake was chocolate\n   B: The muffins were blueberry\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false (the cake was not chocolate).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. This type of logical fallacy is known as \"denying the antecedent.\" Just because the \"if\" part is false, we can't assume the \"then\" part is also false.\n\n6. In this specific case, the muffins could still be blueberry even if the cake wasn't chocolate. The statement doesn't provide any information about what kind of muffins there are when the cake isn't chocolate.\n\n7. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether the muffins were blueberry or not.\n\nAnswer: no"
