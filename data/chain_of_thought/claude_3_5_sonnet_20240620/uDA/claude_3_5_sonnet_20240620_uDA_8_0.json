            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n   b) The vampire was not awake.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   B = \"the mummy was awake\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false (the vampire was not awake).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider these possibilities:\n   - The vampire could be asleep and the mummy could be asleep.\n   - The vampire could be asleep and the mummy could be awake.\n\n   Both of these scenarios satisfy the given information.\n\n6. Therefore, we don't have enough information to determine whether the mummy was awake or not.\n\n7. We cannot infer that the mummy was not awake based solely on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
