            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The splat might not have been morphed.\"\n2. This statement suggests there's a possibility that the splat was not morphed.\n3. If something might not have happened, it means it's not certain or necessary that it did happen.\n4. The phrase \"It's not the case that the splat must have been morphed\" is essentially saying the same thing in a different way.\n5. \"Must have been\" implies certainty or necessity.\n6. \"It's not the case that... must have been\" is negating that certainty or necessity.\n7. Both statements are expressing that there's a possibility the splat was not morphed, or in other words, that it's not certain or necessary that the splat was morphed.\n8. Since both statements convey the same logical meaning, we can indeed infer one from the other.\n\nAnswer: yes"
