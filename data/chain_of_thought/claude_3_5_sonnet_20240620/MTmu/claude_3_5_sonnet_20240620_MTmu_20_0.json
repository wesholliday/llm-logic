            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow.\n   b) It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The apple was red\n   B: The banana must have been yellow\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B:\n   Not B: It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, Not P\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If A \u2192 B (If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow)\n   Not B (It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow)\n   Therefore, Not A (The apple was not red)\n\n6. The Modus Tollens rule is a valid logical inference. If we accept the truth of the two given statements, we must also accept the conclusion that follows from them.\n\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer that \"The apple was not red\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
