            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n   b) It's not the case that the truck must have been blue.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The car was red\n   B: The truck must have been blue\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B:\n   Not B: It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens, which states:\n   If (If A, then B) and (Not B), then (Not A)\n\n5. Our situation perfectly fits this logical structure:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\" (If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue)\n   - We have \"Not B\" (It's not the case that the truck must have been blue)\n\n6. Therefore, applying modus tollens, we can conclude \"Not A\":\n   Not A: The car was not red\n\n7. This logical inference is valid and sound based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
