            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\n   b) It's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement. It's a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Mary was at the wedding\n   B: Sue must have been at the wedding\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B. It's saying that B is false.\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens, which states:\n   If (P \u2192 Q) and (not Q), then (not P)\n   Where P \u2192 Q means \"If P, then Q\"\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   P: Mary was at the wedding\n   Q: Sue must have been at the wedding\n\n   We have (P \u2192 Q) from statement 1, and (not Q) from statement 2.\n\n6. Therefore, by modus tollens, we can conclude (not P), which means \"Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n\n7. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw this conclusion with certainty based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
