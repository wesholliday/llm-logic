            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n   b) It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B: Mark must have bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"It's not the case that B\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   Not Q (Q is false)\n   Therefore, Not P (P must be false)\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If A \u2192 B (If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt)\n   Not B (It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt)\n   Therefore, Not A (Lisa did not buy the red shirt)\n\n6. The logic holds because if the consequent (Mark buying the blue shirt) is false, the antecedent (Lisa buying the red shirt) must also be false for the conditional statement to remain true.\n\n7. Therefore, we can indeed infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt from the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
