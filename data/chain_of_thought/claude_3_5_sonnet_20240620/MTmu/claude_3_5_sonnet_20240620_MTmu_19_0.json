            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball.\n   b) It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\":\n   P: Tom watched football\n   Q: Jen must have watched basketball\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q:\n   Not Q: It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. In this case:\n   - We have \"If P, then Q\"\n   - We're told that Q is false (Not Q)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that P must be false\n\n6. Translating this back to our original statements:\n   - If \"Tom watched football\" is true, then \"Jen must have watched basketball\" would be true\n   - But we're told that \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\"\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that \"Tom did not watch football\"\n\n7. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw the conclusion.\n\nAnswer: yes"
