            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n   b) It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement. It's a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The griffin was in the forest\n   B: The unicorn must have been in the forest\n\n3. The second statement is a negation of B. It's saying \"Not B\".\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called modus tollens, which states:\n   If (If A, then B) and (Not B), then (Not A)\n\n5. Our situation perfectly fits this logical structure:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\" (If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest)\n   - We have \"Not B\" (It's not the case that the unicorn must have been in the forest)\n\n6. Therefore, applying modus tollens, we can conclude \"Not A\", which means \"The griffin was not in the forest\".\n\nThis logical deduction is valid and allows us to make this inference.\n\nAnswer: yes"
