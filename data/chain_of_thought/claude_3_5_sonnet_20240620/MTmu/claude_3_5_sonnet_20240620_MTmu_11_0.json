            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry.\n   b) It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The cake was chocolate\n   B: The muffins must have been blueberry\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B:\n   Not B: It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If A implies B, and not B is true, then not A must be true.\n\n5. Applying Modus Tollens to our scenario:\n   - We know that A implies B (If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry)\n   - We know that not B is true (It's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude that not A must be true (The cake was not chocolate)\n\n6. This logical inference is valid and allows us to draw the conclusion that the cake was not chocolate.\n\nAnswer: yes"
