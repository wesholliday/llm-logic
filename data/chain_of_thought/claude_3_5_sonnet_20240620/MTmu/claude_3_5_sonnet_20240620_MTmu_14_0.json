            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den.\n   b) It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den.\n\n2. Let's represent these statements symbolically:\n   A: The bear was in the cave\n   B: The wolf must have been in the den\n   \n   Statement (a) can be written as: A \u2192 B\n   Statement (b) can be written as: \u00acB\n\n3. In logic, this form of reasoning is known as Modus Tollens. It states that if we have \"If P, then Q\" and \"not Q\", we can conclude \"not P\".\n\n4. In our case:\n   We have \"If A, then B\" (If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf must have been in the den)\n   We also have \"not B\" (It's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den)\n\n5. Following Modus Tollens, we can indeed conclude \"not A\" (The bear was not in the cave).\n\n6. To further illustrate:\n   - If the bear was in the cave, the wolf must have been in the den.\n   - But we know the wolf wasn't necessarily in the den.\n   - Therefore, the condition for the bear being in the cave wasn't met.\n   - So, we can conclude that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: yes"
