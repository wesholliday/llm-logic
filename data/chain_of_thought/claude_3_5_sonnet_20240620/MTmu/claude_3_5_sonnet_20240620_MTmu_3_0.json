            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\n   b) It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The book was written by James\n   B: The book must be a mystery novel\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"It's not the case that B\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   \u00acQ (Not Q)\n   Therefore, \u00acP (Not P)\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If A \u2192 B (If the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel)\n   \u00acB (It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel)\n   Therefore, \u00acA (The book was not written by James)\n\n6. The Modus Tollens rule is a valid form of logical inference, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n7. Therefore, based on the given information and using the Modus Tollens rule of inference, we can logically conclude that \"The book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
