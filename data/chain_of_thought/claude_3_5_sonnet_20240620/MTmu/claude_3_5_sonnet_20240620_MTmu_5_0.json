            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n   b) It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\":\n   P: Jeff played basketball\n   Q: Amy must have played tennis\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of Q:\n   Not Q: It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   And Not Q (Q is false)\n   Then Not P (P must be false)\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   P \u2192 Q: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\n   Not Q: It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\n   Therefore, Not P: Jeff did not play basketball\n\n6. The given information fits perfectly with the Modus Tollens rule, allowing us to logically conclude that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: yes"
