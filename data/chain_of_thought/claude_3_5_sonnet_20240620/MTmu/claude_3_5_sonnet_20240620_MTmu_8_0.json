            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n   b) It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake.\n\n2. Let's represent these statements symbolically:\n   V: The vampire was awake\n   M: The mummy must have been awake\n   \n   Statement a) can be written as: V \u2192 M\n   Statement b) can be written as: \u00acM\n\n3. In logic, this form of reasoning is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q and \u00acQ, then \u00acP\n\n4. In our case:\n   V \u2192 M (If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake)\n   \u00acM (It's not the case that the mummy must have been awake)\n\n5. Applying Modus Tollens:\n   Since we have V \u2192 M and \u00acM, we can conclude \u00acV\n\n6. Translating \u00acV back into words:\n   The vampire was not awake\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer that \"The vampire was not awake\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
