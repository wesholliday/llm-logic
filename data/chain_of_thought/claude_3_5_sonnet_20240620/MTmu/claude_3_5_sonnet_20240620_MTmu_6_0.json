            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n   b) It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\"\n   This is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B,\" where:\n   A = Sue chose pizza\n   B = Bob must have chosen pasta\n\n3. The second statement, \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta,\" is a negation of B.\n   Let's call this statement \"not B.\"\n\n4. In logic, there's a rule called Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If we have \"If A, then B\" and \"not B,\" we can conclude \"not A.\"\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   We have \"If A, then B\" (If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta)\n   We also have \"not B\" (It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta)\n\n6. Therefore, using Modus Tollens, we can logically conclude \"not A,\" which means \"Sue did not choose pizza.\"\n\nThis logical inference is valid and allows us to conclude that Sue did not choose pizza based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: yes"
