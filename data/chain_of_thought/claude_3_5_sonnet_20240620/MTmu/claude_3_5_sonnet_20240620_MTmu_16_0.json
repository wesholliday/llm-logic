            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We're given two statements:\n   a) If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim.\n   b) It's not the case that the pants must have been denim.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The shirt was cotton\n   B: The pants must have been denim\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"It's not the case that B\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   If A (shirt was cotton), then B (pants must have been denim)\n   Not B (It's not the case that the pants must have been denim)\n   Therefore, not A (The shirt was not cotton)\n\n6. The Modus Tollens rule is a valid logical inference. If we accept the premises as true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n7. In this case, we can indeed infer that \"The shirt was not cotton\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
