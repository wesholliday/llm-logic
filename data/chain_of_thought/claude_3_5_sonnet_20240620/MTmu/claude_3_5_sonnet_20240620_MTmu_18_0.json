            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n   b) It's not the case that the truck must have been metal.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The doll was plastic\n   B: The truck must have been metal\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of B: \"It's not the case that B\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as Modus Tollens, which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   \u00acQ (Not Q)\n   Therefore, \u00acP (Not P)\n\n5. Applying this to our scenario:\n   If A \u2192 B (If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal)\n   \u00acB (It's not the case that the truck must have been metal)\n   Therefore, \u00acA (The doll was not plastic)\n\n6. The Modus Tollens rule is a valid logical inference, so we can indeed conclude that \"The doll was not plastic\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
