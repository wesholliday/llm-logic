            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n   b) Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"Jeff played basketball\"\n   Q = \"Amy played tennis\"\n\n3. The second statement negates P, stating that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when P is true, not when it's false.\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider these possibilities:\n   - Jeff didn't play basketball, and Amy played tennis\n   - Jeff didn't play basketball, and Amy didn't play tennis\n\n   Both of these scenarios are consistent with our given information.\n\n6. The logical fallacy of assuming that \"not P\" implies \"not Q\" is called the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\n\n7. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot infer whether Amy played tennis or not. The statement about Amy playing tennis remains undetermined based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
