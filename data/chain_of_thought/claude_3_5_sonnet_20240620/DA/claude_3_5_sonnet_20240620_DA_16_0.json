            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two pieces of information:\n   a) If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n   b) The shirt was not cotton.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the shirt was cotton\"\n   B = \"the pants were denim\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. This logical principle is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because the antecedent (A) is false, we can't conclude that the consequent (B) is also false.\n\n6. In this specific case, even though the shirt is not cotton, the pants could still be denim or they could be made of another material. We simply don't have enough information to determine the material of the pants.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer that \"The pants were not denim.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
