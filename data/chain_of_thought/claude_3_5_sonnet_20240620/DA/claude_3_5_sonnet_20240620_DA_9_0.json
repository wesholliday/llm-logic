            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\n   b) Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = Lisa bought the red shirt\n   B = Mark bought the blue shirt\n\n3. The second statement tells us that A is false (Lisa did not buy the red shirt).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. This logical principle is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because the \"if\" part (antecedent) is false, we can't conclude anything about the \"then\" part (consequent).\n\n6. In this case, even though Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, Mark might or might not have bought the blue shirt. The information given doesn't allow us to determine Mark's action.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
