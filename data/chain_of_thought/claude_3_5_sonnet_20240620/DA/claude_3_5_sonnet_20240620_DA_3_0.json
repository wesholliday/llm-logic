            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel.\n   b) The book was not written by James.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the book was written by James\"\n   B = \"the book is a mystery novel\"\n\n3. The second statement negates A, stating that the book was not written by James.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is related to a common fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" The structure is:\n   If A, then B.\n   Not A.\n   Therefore, not B.\n\n5. This reasoning is not logically valid. Just because the antecedent (A) is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (B).\n\n6. In this specific case, even though James didn't write the book, it could still be a mystery novel written by someone else.\n\n7. The original statement only tells us that James' books are mystery novels. It doesn't say anything about books not written by James or that only James writes mystery novels.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer that \"The book is not a mystery novel\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
