            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   b) Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   Q = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n3. The second statement negates P, stating that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is related to a rule called \"modus tollens\", which states:\n   If P \u2192 Q (If P, then Q)\n   And \u00acP (not P)\n   Then we can conclude \u00acQ (not Q)\n\n5. However, this rule doesn't apply here. We're given \u00acP, but we can't use this to conclude anything about Q.\n\n6. The original statement only tells us what happens if Mary is at the wedding. It doesn't provide any information about Sue's attendance if Mary is not at the wedding.\n\n7. Sue could still be at the wedding even if Mary is not there. The statement doesn't exclude this possibility.\n\n8. Therefore, we cannot logically infer whether Sue was or was not at the wedding based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
