            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n   b) Tom did not watch football.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"Tom watched football\"\n   Q = \"Jen watched basketball\"\n\n3. The second statement tells us that P is false (Tom did not watch football).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when P is true, not when it's false.\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider these possibilities:\n   - Tom didn't watch football, and Jen watched basketball\n   - Tom didn't watch football, and Jen didn't watch basketball\n\n   Both of these scenarios are consistent with our given information.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine whether Jen watched basketball or not.\n\n7. The question asks if we can infer that \"Jen did not watch basketball\", but we've shown that this cannot be concluded from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
