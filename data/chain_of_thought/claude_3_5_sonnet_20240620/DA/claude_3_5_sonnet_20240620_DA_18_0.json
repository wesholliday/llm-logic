            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n   b) The doll was not plastic.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"the doll was plastic\"\n   Q = \"the truck was metal\"\n\n3. The second statement negates P, stating that the doll was not plastic.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is related to a concept called \"modus tollens\", but it's important to note that we're not using modus tollens here. Modus tollens would be:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not Q\n   Therefore, not P\n\n5. What we have instead is:\n   If P, then Q\n   Not P\n   \n6. This logical structure doesn't allow us to draw any definitive conclusion about Q (whether the truck was metal or not).\n\n7. The original conditional statement only tells us what happens if the doll is plastic. It doesn't provide any information about what happens if the doll is not plastic.\n\n8. Therefore, when we're told that the doll is not plastic, we can't infer anything about the truck. It may be metal, or it may not be metal - we simply don't have enough information to determine this.\n\nAnswer: no"
