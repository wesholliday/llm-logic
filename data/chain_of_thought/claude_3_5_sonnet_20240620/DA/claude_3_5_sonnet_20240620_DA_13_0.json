            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\n   b) The car was not red.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"the car was red\"\n   Q = \"the truck was blue\"\n\n3. The second statement negates P, stating that the car was not red.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is related to a concept called \"the fallacy of denying the antecedent.\" This fallacy occurs when we incorrectly conclude that because the antecedent (P) is false, the consequent (Q) must also be false.\n\n5. However, the original conditional statement only tells us what happens if the car is red. It doesn't provide any information about the color of the truck when the car is not red.\n\n6. For example, the truck could be blue for other reasons, regardless of the car's color.\n\n7. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot logically conclude whether the truck is blue or not blue when the car is not red.\n\n8. We can only say that based on the given information, the color of the truck is undetermined.\n\nAnswer: no"
