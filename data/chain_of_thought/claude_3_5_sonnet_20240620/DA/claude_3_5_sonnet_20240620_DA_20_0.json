            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\n   b) The apple was not red.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"the apple was red\"\n   Q = \"the banana was yellow\"\n\n3. The second statement negates P, stating that the apple was not red.\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is related to the fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" The structure is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   Not P.\n   Therefore, not Q.\n\n5. This form of reasoning is not logically valid. Just because the antecedent (P) is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (Q).\n\n6. In this specific case, even if the apple is not red, the banana could still be yellow for other reasons. The conditional statement only tells us what happens if the apple is red; it doesn't provide information about the banana's color when the apple is not red.\n\n7. Therefore, from the given information, we cannot logically infer that \"The banana was not yellow.\"\n\nAnswer: no"
