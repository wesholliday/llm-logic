            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n   b) Joe did not go to the park.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"Joe went to the park\"\n   Q = \"Lucy went to the zoo\"\n\n3. The second statement negates P, stating that Joe did not go to the park.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when P is true, not when it's false.\n\n5. To illustrate this, consider these possibilities:\n   - Joe didn't go to the park, and Lucy went to the zoo.\n   - Joe didn't go to the park, and Lucy didn't go to the zoo.\n   Both of these scenarios are consistent with the given information.\n\n6. The logical fallacy of assuming that \"not P\" implies \"not Q\" is known as denying the antecedent.\n\n7. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot infer whether Lucy went to the zoo or not. The information about Lucy's trip to the zoo remains unknown.\n\nAnswer: no"
