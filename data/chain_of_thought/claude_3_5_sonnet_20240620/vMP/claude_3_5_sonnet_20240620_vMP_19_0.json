            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball)\n   Premise 2: P (Tom watched football)\n   Conclusion: Q (Jen watched basketball)\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Ponens, which is Latin for \"mode that affirms.\"\n\n3. The structure of Modus Ponens is:\n   If P, then Q\n   P\n   Therefore, Q\n\n4. This form of argument is considered logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n\n5. Here's why it's valid:\n   - The first premise establishes a conditional relationship: if P occurs, then Q must occur.\n   - The second premise confirms that P has indeed occurred.\n   - Given these two premises, it logically follows that Q must occur.\n\n6. In this specific case:\n   - If the statement \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" is true,\n   - And if it's also true that \"Tom watched football\",\n   - Then it must necessarily be true that \"Jen watched basketball\".\n\n7. The validity of this form doesn't depend on the actual truth of the premises or conclusion in the real world. It only asserts that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
