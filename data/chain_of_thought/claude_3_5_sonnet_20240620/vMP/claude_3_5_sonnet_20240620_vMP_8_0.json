            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\n   Premise 2: The vampire was awake.\n   Conclusion: The mummy was awake.\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Ponens, which is a valid form of logical reasoning.\n\n3. The structure of Modus Ponens is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   P.\n   Therefore, Q.\n\n4. In this case:\n   P = \"the vampire was awake\"\n   Q = \"the mummy was awake\"\n\n5. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship: if P is true, then Q must be true.\n\n6. The second premise affirms that P is indeed true.\n\n7. Given these two premises, it logically follows that Q must be true.\n\n8. This form of argument is considered valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. It's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n9. The validity of the argument form doesn't depend on whether the premises or conclusion are actually true in reality, but on the logical relationship between them.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this argument form is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
