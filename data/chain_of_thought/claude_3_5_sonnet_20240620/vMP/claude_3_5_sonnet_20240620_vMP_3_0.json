            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel)\n   Premise 2: P (The book was written by James)\n   Conclusion: Q (The book is a mystery novel)\n\n2. This argument structure is known as Modus Ponens, which is Latin for \"mode that affirms.\"\n\n3. Modus Ponens is one of the fundamental rules of logical inference. It states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, we can conclude that the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\n4. In this case:\n   - We have the conditional statement: If the book was written by James, then it's a mystery novel.\n   - We're told that the antecedent is true: The book was indeed written by James.\n   - Therefore, we can logically conclude that the consequent must be true: The book is a mystery novel.\n\n5. This form of argument is considered logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must necessarily be true. It's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n6. The validity of the argument doesn't depend on whether the premises are actually true in reality, but rather on the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this form of argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
