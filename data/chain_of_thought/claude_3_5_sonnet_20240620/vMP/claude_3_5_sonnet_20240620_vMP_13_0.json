            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (If the car was red, then the truck was blue)\n   Premise 2: P (The car was red)\n   Conclusion: Q (The truck was blue)\n\n2. This argument form is known as Modus Ponens, which is Latin for \"mode that affirms.\"\n\n3. The structure of Modus Ponens is:\n   If P, then Q\n   P\n   Therefore, Q\n\n4. Modus Ponens is considered a fundamental rule of logical inference and is universally accepted as valid.\n\n5. The validity of this argument form comes from the fact that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. There's no possible scenario where both premises could be true and the conclusion false.\n\n6. In this specific case:\n   - If it's true that \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\"\n   - And it's also true that \"The car was red\"\n   - Then it logically follows that \"The truck was blue\"\n\n7. The argument doesn't rely on the actual color of the car or truck in the real world. It's about the logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
