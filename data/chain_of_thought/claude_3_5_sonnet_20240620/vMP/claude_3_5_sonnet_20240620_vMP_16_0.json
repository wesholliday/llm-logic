            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: A\n   Conclusion: B\n\n   Where A = \"the shirt was cotton\" and B = \"the pants were denim\"\n\n2. This argument structure is known as Modus Ponens, which is Latin for \"mode that affirms.\"\n\n3. Modus Ponens is one of the fundamental rules of logical inference. It states that if a conditional statement (if P, then Q) is true, and the antecedent (P) is true, then the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\n4. In this case:\n   - We have the conditional statement: If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\n   - We're told that the antecedent is true: The shirt was cotton.\n   - Therefore, according to Modus Ponens, we can validly conclude that the consequent is true: The pants were denim.\n\n5. It's important to note that logical validity is about the form of the argument, not the truth of the premises or conclusion. Even if the premises or conclusion were factually false, the argument would still be logically valid because it follows the correct logical structure.\n\n6. This form of argument preserves truth: if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. This is what makes it logically valid.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this argument form is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
