            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n   Premise 2: Mary was at the wedding.\n   Conclusion: Sue was at the wedding.\n\n2. This argument follows a logical form known as Modus Ponens, which is Latin for \"method of affirming.\"\n\n3. The general structure of Modus Ponens is:\n   If P, then Q.\n   P.\n   Therefore, Q.\n\n4. In this case:\n   P = \"Mary was at the wedding\"\n   Q = \"Sue was at the wedding\"\n\n5. Modus Ponens is considered a valid form of argument in propositional logic. It states that if we accept a conditional statement (If P, then Q) as true, and we also accept the antecedent (P) as true, then we must accept the consequent (Q) as true.\n\n6. The logic works like this:\n   - We accept that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was there too.\n   - We know for a fact that Mary was at the wedding.\n   - Therefore, we can conclude with certainty that Sue was at the wedding.\n\n7. This form of argument is deductively valid, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. The truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
