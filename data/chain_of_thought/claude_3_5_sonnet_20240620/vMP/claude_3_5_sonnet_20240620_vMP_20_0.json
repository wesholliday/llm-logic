            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If A, then B\n   Premise 2: A\n   Conclusion: B\n\n   Where A = \"the apple was red\" and B = \"the banana was yellow\"\n\n2. This argument structure is known as Modus Ponens, which is Latin for \"method of affirming.\"\n\n3. Modus Ponens is one of the fundamental rules of logical inference. It states that if we have a conditional statement (If A, then B) and the antecedent (A) is true, we can conclude that the consequent (B) must also be true.\n\n4. The logic behind this is straightforward:\n   - We're told that if A is true, B must be true (Premise 1)\n   - We're then told that A is indeed true (Premise 2)\n   - Therefore, B must be true (Conclusion)\n\n5. This form of argument is considered logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. It's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n6. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on the actual truth of the statements, but on the form of the argument. Even if the apple wasn't actually red or the banana wasn't actually yellow, the argument form itself is still valid.\n\n7. In this specific case, if it's true that a red apple implies a yellow banana, and it's also true that the apple is red, then it logically follows that the banana must be yellow.\n\nAnswer: yes"
