            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q (where P = \"Jeff played basketball\" and Q = \"Amy played tennis\")\n   Premise 2: P\n   Conclusion: Q\n\n2. This argument structure is known as Modus Ponens, which is Latin for \"mode that affirms.\"\n\n3. Modus Ponens is one of the fundamental rules of logical inference. It states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and we affirm the antecedent (P), we can logically conclude the consequent (Q).\n\n4. The logic behind this is straightforward:\n   - We're told that if P is true, then Q must be true.\n   - We're then told that P is indeed true.\n   - Therefore, Q must be true.\n\n5. In this specific case:\n   - We're told that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n   - We're then told that Jeff did play basketball.\n   - Therefore, we can logically conclude that Amy played tennis.\n\n6. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on whether the premises or conclusion are actually true in the real world. It only concerns whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises if we assume the premises are true.\n\n7. In this case, if we accept both premises as true, the conclusion must be true. This is the definition of a logically valid argument.\n\nTherefore, this argument form is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
