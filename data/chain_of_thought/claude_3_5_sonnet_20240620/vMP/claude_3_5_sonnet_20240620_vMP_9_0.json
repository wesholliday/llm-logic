            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. First, let's identify the structure of this argument:\n   Premise 1: If P, then Q\n   Premise 2: P\n   Conclusion: Q\n\n   Where P is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" and Q is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2. This argument structure is known as Modus Ponens, which is Latin for \"method of affirming.\"\n\n3. Modus Ponens is one of the fundamental rules of inference in propositional logic. It states that if we have a conditional statement (If P, then Q) and the antecedent (P) is true, we can conclude that the consequent (Q) must also be true.\n\n4. In this case:\n   - We're given that \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" (If P, then Q)\n   - We're also told that \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" (P is true)\n   - Therefore, we can logically conclude that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" (Q must be true)\n\n5. This form of argument is considered logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. It's impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false.\n\n6. It's important to note that logical validity doesn't depend on whether the premises or conclusion are actually true in reality. It only concerns the form of the argument and whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nGiven this reasoning, we can conclude that this form of argument is indeed logically valid.\n\nAnswer: yes"
