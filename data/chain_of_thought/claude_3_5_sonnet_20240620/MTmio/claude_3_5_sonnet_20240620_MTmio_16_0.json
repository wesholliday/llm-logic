            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"The pants might not have been denim\"\n   b) \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim\"\n\n2. Statement (a) suggests that there's a possibility the pants were not denim. It doesn't definitively say they weren't denim, just that they might not have been.\n\n3. Statement (b) is a conditional statement. It says that IF the shirt was cotton, THEN the pants must have been denim. This is a strong, definitive statement.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the logical relationship between these statements:\n   - If the shirt was cotton, then according to (b), the pants MUST have been denim.\n   - But (a) tells us that the pants might not have been denim.\n\n5. These two statements can only be simultaneously true if the condition in (b) is not met - that is, if the shirt was not cotton.\n\n6. If the shirt were cotton, it would force the pants to be denim (according to b), which would contradict statement (a).\n\n7. Therefore, to avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nThis logical deduction is an example of modus tollens: If P then Q, not Q, therefore not P.\n\nAnswer: yes"
