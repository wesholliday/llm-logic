            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\"\n   b) \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\"\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement. It suggests that there's a possibility that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt. This doesn't mean he definitely didn't buy it, just that it's not certain that he did.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the second statement. This is a conditional statement: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n4. We need to consider how these statements interact. If Lisa did buy the red shirt, then according to the second statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\n5. However, the first statement tells us that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This creates a contradiction with the scenario where Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\n6. Given that both statements are true, the only way to resolve this contradiction is if Lisa did not buy the red shirt. If she had, it would force Mark to have bought the blue shirt, which contradicts the first statement.\n\n7. Therefore, to maintain consistency between both given statements, we must conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: yes"
