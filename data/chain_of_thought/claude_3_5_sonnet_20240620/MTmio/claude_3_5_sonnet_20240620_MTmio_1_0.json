            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\"\n   b) \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\"\n\n2. Statement (a) suggests that there's a possibility Sue wasn't at the wedding. It doesn't definitively state that Sue wasn't there, just that it's a possibility.\n\n3. Statement (b) is a conditional statement. It says that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the logical relationship between these statements:\n   - If Mary was at the wedding, then according to statement (b), Sue must have been there too.\n   - But statement (a) tells us that Sue might not have been there.\n\n5. These two statements create a contradiction if we assume Mary was at the wedding:\n   - Mary's presence would necessitate Sue's presence (from b)\n   - But we're told Sue might not have been there (from a)\n\n6. The only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that Mary was not at the wedding. If Mary wasn't there, then statement (b) doesn't apply, and statement (a) can be true without contradiction.\n\n7. Therefore, based on the given information, we can logically infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: yes"
