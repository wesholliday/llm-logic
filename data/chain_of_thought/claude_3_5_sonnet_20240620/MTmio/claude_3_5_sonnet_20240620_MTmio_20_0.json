            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"The banana might not have been yellow\"\n   b) \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\"\n\n2. Let's consider statement (a). It suggests that there's a possibility that the banana was not yellow. This doesn't mean the banana definitely wasn't yellow, just that it might not have been.\n\n3. Now, let's look at statement (b). This is a conditional statement: if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This statement establishes a definite relationship between the apple being red and the banana being yellow.\n\n4. If we assume the apple was red, then according to statement (b), the banana must have been yellow. However, this contradicts statement (a), which says the banana might not have been yellow.\n\n5. The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the apple was not red. If the apple wasn't red, then the conditional statement (b) doesn't apply, and there's no conflict with the possibility of the banana not being yellow.\n\n6. Therefore, to maintain consistency between both statements, we must conclude that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
