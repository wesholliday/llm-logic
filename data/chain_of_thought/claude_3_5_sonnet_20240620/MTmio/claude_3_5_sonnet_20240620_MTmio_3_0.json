            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"The book might not be a mystery novel\"\n   b) \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel\"\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement. It suggests that there's a possibility that the book is not a mystery novel. It doesn't definitively state that it isn't, just that it might not be.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the second statement. This is a conditional statement: IF James wrote the book, THEN it must be a mystery novel. This statement is absolute - there's no room for doubt if James wrote it.\n\n4. Combining these statements:\n   - We know that if James wrote the book, it must be a mystery novel (no exceptions).\n   - But we also know that the book might not be a mystery novel.\n\n5. These two pieces of information create a logical conflict if James wrote the book:\n   - If James wrote it, it must be a mystery novel.\n   - But we're told it might not be a mystery novel.\n\n6. The only way to resolve this conflict is if James did not write the book.\n   - If James wrote it, there would be no possibility of it not being a mystery novel.\n   - Since there is a possibility it's not a mystery novel, James cannot have written it.\n\n7. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: yes"
