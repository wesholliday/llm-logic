            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"The truck might not have been metal\"\n   b) \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal\"\n\n2. Statement (a) suggests that there's a possibility the truck was not metal. It doesn't definitively say it wasn't metal, just that it might not have been.\n\n3. Statement (b) is a conditional statement. It says that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This is a definite relationship.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the logical implications:\n   - If the doll was plastic, then according to statement (b), the truck must have been metal.\n   - But statement (a) says the truck might not have been metal.\n   - These two statements would contradict each other if the doll was plastic.\n\n5. To avoid this contradiction, we must conclude that the doll was not plastic. Because if it were plastic, the truck would have to be metal, which contradicts the possibility presented in statement (a).\n\n6. This is an example of reasoning by contradiction. We assume the opposite of what we want to prove (that the doll was plastic), and show that it leads to a contradiction with the given information.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can indeed infer that the doll was not plastic.\n\nAnswer: yes"
