            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"The truck might not have been blue\"\n   b) \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\"\n\n2. Let's consider the first statement: \"The truck might not have been blue\"\n   This means there's a possibility that the truck was not blue. It doesn't rule out that the truck could have been blue, but it allows for the possibility that it wasn't.\n\n3. Now, let's look at the second statement: \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\"\n   This is a conditional statement. It states that if the condition \"the car was red\" is true, then it necessarily follows that \"the truck must have been blue\".\n\n4. Now, let's combine these pieces of information:\n   - We know that the truck might not have been blue (it's possible it wasn't blue)\n   - We also know that if the car was red, the truck MUST have been blue (no possibility of it not being blue in this case)\n\n5. These two statements create a contradiction if we assume the car was red:\n   - If the car was red, the truck must be blue (no other possibility)\n   - But we're told the truck might not have been blue (allowing for other possibilities)\n\n6. The only way to resolve this contradiction is if the car was not red.\n   If the car was not red, then the conditional statement \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" doesn't apply, and there's no conflict with the statement \"The truck might not have been blue\".\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: yes"
