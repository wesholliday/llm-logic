We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The whiffle did not tink\"\n   b) \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The whiffle was shanked\n   B: The whiffle tinked\n\n3. Statement (a) tells us that B is false (the whiffle did not tink).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our situation:\n   - We know that if A (the whiffle was shanked) is true, then B (the whiffle tinked) must be true.\n   - We also know that B is false (the whiffle did not tink).\n   - Therefore, A must be false (the whiffle was not shanked).\n\n6. The conclusion \"The whiffle was not shanked\" is the negation of A, which is exactly what we've determined must be true.\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"The whiffle was not shanked\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
