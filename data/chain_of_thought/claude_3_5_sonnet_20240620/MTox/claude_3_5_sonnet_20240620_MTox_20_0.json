            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"The fleeg did not surn\"\n   b) \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement. It can be written logically as:\n   If A (fleeg was bluttered), then B (it surned)\n\n3. We know from statement (a) that the fleeg did not surn. This is the negation of B in our conditional statement.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as modus tollens or denying the consequent.\n\n5. Applying this to our situation:\n   - We have: If A, then B\n   - We know: Not B\n   - We can conclude: Not A\n\n6. Translating this back to our original terms:\n   - If the fleeg was bluttered (A), then it surned (B)\n   - We know it did not surn (Not B)\n   - We can conclude it was not bluttered (Not A)\n\nTherefore, from the given information, we can logically infer that \"The fleeg was not bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
