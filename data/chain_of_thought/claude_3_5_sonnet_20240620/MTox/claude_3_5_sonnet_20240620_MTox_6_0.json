            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The grommet did not plop the frink\"\n   b) \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the grommet was sploffed\"\n   B = \"the grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n3. Statement (a) tells us that B is false (the grommet did NOT plop the frink).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our situation:\n   - We know \"If A, then B\" (from statement b)\n   - We know \"not B\" (from statement a)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"not A\"\n\n6. \"Not A\" in this case means \"The grommet was not sploffed\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet was not sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
