            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step by step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The shank was not nugged\"\n   b) \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\"\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\" where:\n   P = \"The shank was plooked\"\n   Q = \"The shank was nugged\"\n\n3. We know from the first given statement that \"The shank was not nugged\"\n   This means that Q is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - We have \"If P, then Q\"\n   - We know that Q is false\n   - Therefore, P must also be false\n\n6. Translating this back to our original terms:\n   - If \"The shank was plooked\" were true, then \"The shank was nugged\" would have to be true\n   - But we know \"The shank was nugged\" is false\n   - Therefore, \"The shank was plooked\" must be false\n\n7. This means we can indeed infer that \"The shank was not plooked\"\n\nAnswer: yes"
