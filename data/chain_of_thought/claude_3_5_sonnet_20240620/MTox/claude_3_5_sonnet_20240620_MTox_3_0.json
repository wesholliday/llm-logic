            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step using logical reasoning:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"The splat did not quank\"\n   b) \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the splat was morphed\"\n   B = \"the splat quanked\"\n\n3. Statement (a) tells us that B is false (the splat did not quank).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens or \"denying the consequent\".\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - We know that if A is true, B must be true (from statement b)\n   - We know that B is false (from statement a)\n   - Therefore, A must be false\n\n6. If A is false, it means \"the splat was not morphed\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
