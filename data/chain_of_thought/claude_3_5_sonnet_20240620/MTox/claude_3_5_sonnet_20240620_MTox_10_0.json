            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The wug was not garpled\"\n   b) \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\"\n\n2. Let's consider the second statement: \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\"\n   This is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the wug was sproinged\"\n   B = \"it was garpled\"\n\n3. Now, we know from the first statement that \"The wug was not garpled\"\n   This means that B is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens (denying the consequent).\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\"\n   - We know \"not B\" is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"not A\" must be true\n\n6. Translating this back to our original terms:\n   - If \"the wug was not garpled\" (which we know is true)\n   - Then \"the wug was not sproinged\" must also be true\n\nTherefore, we can indeed infer \"The wug was not sproinged\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
