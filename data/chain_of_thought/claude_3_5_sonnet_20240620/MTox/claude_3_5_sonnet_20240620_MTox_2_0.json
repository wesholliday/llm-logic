            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"The wug did not bim the zoint\"\n   b) \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint\"\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: \"the wug was flooped\"\n   B: \"the wug bimmed the zoint\"\n\n3. Statement (a) tells us that B is false: the wug did not bim the zoint.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our situation:\n   - We know \"If A, then B\" (If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint)\n   - We know \"not B\" (The wug did not bim the zoint)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"not A\" (The wug was not flooped)\n\n6. This conclusion \"The wug was not flooped\" is exactly what we're asked if we can infer.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that \"The wug was not flooped\".\n\nAnswer: yes"
