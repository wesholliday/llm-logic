            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) The sprocket was not daggled.\n   b) If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\":\n   A: The sprocket was cranked\n   B: The sprocket was daggled\n\n3. We know from statement (a) that B is false (the sprocket was NOT daggled).\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that B is false, we can conclude that A must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens or \"denying the consequent.\"\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - We have \"If A, then B\"\n   - We know \"not B\" is true\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"not A\" is true\n\n6. Translating this back to our original statements:\n   - If \"The sprocket was cranked\" (A), then \"The sprocket was daggled\" (B)\n   - We know \"The sprocket was not daggled\" (not B)\n   - Therefore, we can conclude \"The sprocket was not cranked\" (not A)\n\nSo, based on the given information and logical reasoning, we can indeed infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: yes"
