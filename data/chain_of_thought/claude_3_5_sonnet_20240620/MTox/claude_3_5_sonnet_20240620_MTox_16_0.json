            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) \"The sneg did not sproted the frink\"\n   b) \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\"\n\n2. The first statement directly tells us that the sneg did not sprotet the frink. This is a fact we know for certain.\n\n3. The second statement is a conditional statement. It tells us that IF the sneg was crampled, THEN it would have sproted the frink.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the logical structure:\n   - If P (the sneg was crampled), then Q (the sneg sproted the frink)\n   - We know that Q is false (the sneg did not sprotet the frink)\n\n5. In logic, this structure is known as modus tollens:\n   - If P, then Q\n   - Not Q\n   - Therefore, not P\n\n6. Applying this to our situation:\n   - If the sneg was crampled, then it sproted the frink\n   - The sneg did not sprotet the frink\n   - Therefore, the sneg was not crampled\n\n7. This logical inference is valid and allows us to conclude that the sneg was indeed not crampled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
