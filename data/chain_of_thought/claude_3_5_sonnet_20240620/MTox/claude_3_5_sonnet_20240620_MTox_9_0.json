            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We are given two statements:\n   a) The twonk was not varnished.\n   b) If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\":\n   P: The twonk was plinked\n   Q: The twonk was varnished\n\n3. We know from statement (a) that the twonk was not varnished. This means Q is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens.\n\n5. Applying modus tollens to our situation:\n   - If P is true, then Q must be true (from the conditional statement)\n   - But Q is false (from statement a)\n   - Therefore, P must be false\n\n6. P being false means \"The twonk was not plinked\"\n\nTherefore, we can logically infer that the twonk was not plinked from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: yes"
