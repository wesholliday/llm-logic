            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) The zinger was not smoogled.\n   b) If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\n\n2. Statement (b) is a conditional statement. It means that if the condition \"the zinger was fraggled\" is true, then the consequence \"the zinger was smoogled\" must also be true.\n\n3. We know from statement (a) that the zinger was not smoogled. This means the consequence in the conditional statement (b) is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"if P, then Q\" and we know that Q is false, we can conclude that P must also be false. This is known as the logical rule of modus tollens.\n\n5. Applying this rule to our situation:\n   - If P (the zinger was fraggled), then Q (the zinger was smoogled)\n   - We know Q is false (the zinger was not smoogled)\n   - Therefore, P must also be false (the zinger was not fraggled)\n\n6. Thus, we can logically conclude that the zinger was not fraggled.\n\nAnswer: yes"
