            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it must be plopped\"\n   b) \"It's not the case that the grommet must be plopped\"\n\n2. The first statement is a logical disjunction (OR statement). It means that at least one of the two conditions must be true:\n   - The grommet is sploffed\n   OR\n   - The grommet must be plopped\n\n3. The second statement negates one of these conditions. It tells us that \"the grommet must be plopped\" is false.\n\n4. In logic, when we have an OR statement and we know that one of the options is false, we can conclude that the other option must be true. This is known as the disjunctive syllogism.\n\n5. Since we know that \"the grommet must be plopped\" is false, and we have an OR statement saying it must be either sploffed or plopped, we can logically conclude that the remaining option must be true.\n\n6. Therefore, we can infer that \"The grommet is sploffed\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: yes"
