            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\"\n   b) \"The grommet was not sploffed\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the grommet was sploffed\"\n   B = \"the grommet plopped the frink\"\n\n3. The second statement directly negates A, stating that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If A, then B\" and we know that A is false, we cannot conclude anything about B. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when A is true, not when A is false.\n\n5. This logical principle is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. Just because the antecedent (A) is false, we cannot conclude that the consequent (B) is also false.\n\n6. In this case, even though we know the grommet was not sploffed, we cannot conclude whether or not the grommet plopped the frink. It's possible that the grommet could have plopped the frink for reasons unrelated to being sploffed.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot logically infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
