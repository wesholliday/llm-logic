            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two given statements:\n   a) If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged.\n   b) The shank was not plooked.\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If P, then Q\", where:\n   P = \"the shank was plooked\"\n   Q = \"the shank was nugged\"\n\n3. The second statement is the negation of P: \"The shank was not plooked.\"\n\n4. In logic, when we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is false, we cannot conclude anything about Q. This is because the conditional only tells us what happens when P is true, not when it's false.\n\n5. This logical principle is often referred to as the \"fallacy of denying the antecedent.\" Just because the antecedent (P) is false, we can't determine whether the consequent (Q) is true or false.\n\n6. In this case, knowing that the shank was not plooked doesn't give us any information about whether it was nugged or not. It could have been nugged for other reasons, or it might not have been nugged at all.\n\n7. Therefore, we cannot infer that \"The shank was not nugged\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: no"
