            "content": "Explanation: Let's approach this step-by-step:\n\n1. We have two statements:\n   a) \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink\"\n   b) \"The sneg was not crampled\"\n\n2. The first statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\", where:\n   A = \"the sneg was crampled\"\n   B = \"the sneg sproted the frink\"\n\n3. The second statement directly negates A, stating that \"The sneg was not crampled\"\n\n4. In logic, this scenario is known as the fallacy of denying the antecedent. It follows the structure:\n   If A, then B\n   Not A\n   Therefore, not B\n\n5. However, this is not a valid logical inference. Just because the antecedent (A) is false, we cannot conclude anything about the consequent (B).\n\n6. To illustrate with a real-world example:\n   If it's raining, the grass is wet.\n   It's not raining.\n   We cannot conclude from this that the grass is not wet (it could be wet for other reasons).\n\n7. Similarly, in our case, even though the sneg was not crampled, we cannot conclude that it did not sprot the frink. The sneg might sprot the frink for reasons other than being crampled.\n\n8. Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot logically infer that \"The sneg did not sprot the frink\".\n\nAnswer: no"
