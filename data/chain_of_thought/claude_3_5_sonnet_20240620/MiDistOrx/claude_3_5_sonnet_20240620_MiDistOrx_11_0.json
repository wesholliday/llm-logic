            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is \"The frazzle might be blurble or grooble.\"\n\n2. This statement uses the word \"might\" to express possibility, and it applies to both \"blurble\" and \"grooble.\"\n\n3. The word \"or\" in this context is used to present alternatives.\n\n4. The proposed inference is \"The frazzle might be blurble or it might be grooble.\"\n\n5. This inference essentially splits the original statement into two separate possibilities, each with its own \"might.\"\n\n6. The meaning of the original statement and the inference are logically equivalent. Both express that there are two possible states for the frazzle: it could be blurble, or it could be grooble.\n\n7. The inference simply makes this more explicit by repeating \"might\" for each alternative.\n\n8. No additional information or meaning is added or lost in the inference.\n\n9. Therefore, the inference is a valid restatement of the original proposition.\n\nAnswer: yes"
