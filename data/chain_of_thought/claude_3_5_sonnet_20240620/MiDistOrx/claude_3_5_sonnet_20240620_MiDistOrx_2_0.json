            "content": "Explanation: Let's analyze this step-by-step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The wibble might be on the zizz or in the snizzle.\"\n\n2. This statement uses the word \"might\" once, applying it to the entire phrase \"be on the zizz or in the snizzle.\"\n\n3. The proposed inference is: \"The wibble might be on the zizz or it might be in the snizzle.\"\n\n4. In this inference, \"might\" is used twice, once for each location possibility.\n\n5. In logic, when we have a statement of the form \"A or B,\" it's equivalent to saying \"A is possible, or B is possible, or both are possible.\"\n\n6. The original statement allows for the possibility of the wibble being on the zizz, in the snizzle, or potentially both (although this last option is less likely given the context).\n\n7. The proposed inference explicitly states these possibilities by using \"might\" for each option.\n\n8. While the wording is slightly different, the meaning and logical implications of both statements are essentially the same.\n\n9. Therefore, the proposed inference is a valid logical extension of the original statement, as it doesn't introduce any new information or change the fundamental meaning.\n\nAnswer: yes"
