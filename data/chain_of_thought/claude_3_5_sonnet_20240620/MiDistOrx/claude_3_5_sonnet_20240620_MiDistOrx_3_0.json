            "content": "Explanation: Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. The original statement is: \"The snork might be in the wibble or on the quank.\"\n\n2. This statement uses the word \"might\" only once, at the beginning, which applies to the entire phrase that follows.\n\n3. The statement presents two possible locations for the snork: in the wibble or on the quank.\n\n4. The use of \"or\" indicates that these are alternative possibilities.\n\n5. The proposed inference is: \"The snork might be in the wibble or it might be on the quank.\"\n\n6. This inference repeats \"might\" for each possibility, making it explicit that both locations are uncertain.\n\n7. The meaning of the original statement and the inference are essentially the same. Both express uncertainty about the snork's location and present the same two possibilities.\n\n8. The only difference is in the structure and emphasis, with the inference being slightly more explicit about the uncertainty of each option.\n\n9. The inference does not add any new information or change the meaning of the original statement.\n\n10. Therefore, we can logically infer the second statement from the first, as they convey the same information about the possible locations of the snork.\n\nAnswer: yes"
