'If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate the salad' is a conditional statement that implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Ben eating pasta and Kate eating the salad.\n3. Since we know that Ben ate pasta (from step 1), we can conclude that the condition in the conditional statement (step 2) has been satisfied.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that Kate ate the salad, as stated in the conclusion of the conditional statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
