It describes a hypothetical situation (Lisa buying the red shirt) and its consequence (Mark buying the blue shirt).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conditionals\n\n* Since the first sentence states a fact, we know that the condition in the second sentence (\"If Lisa bought the red shirt\") is satisfied.\n* Therefore, the conclusion of the second sentence (\"then Mark bought the blue shirt\") logically follows.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\n* Based on the information provided, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
