            "content": "\nYes, we can infer 'The truck was metal' from the given statements.\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. The statement \"The doll was plastic\" implies that the doll is made of plastic.\n2. The statement \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" is a conditional statement. It expresses a causal relationship between the material of the doll and the material of the truck. Specifically, it states that if the doll is made of plastic, then the truck must be made of metal.\n3. Since we know that the doll is indeed made of plastic (from step 1), we can conclude that the condition in the conditional statement (\"If the doll was plastic\") is satisfied.\n4. Therefore, we can infer the conclusion of the conditional statement, which is \"the truck was metal\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
