            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"Joe went to the park\" - This means that Joe visited the park.\n* \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" - This is a conditional statement that implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Joe's action and Lucy's action. It means that if Joe went to the park, then it is certain that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe need to determine if we can infer \"Lucy went to the zoo\" based on the given information. To do this, we need to evaluate the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conditional statement\n\nThe conditional statement is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\" We know that the antecedent (the part before the \"if\") is true because Joe did go to the park. Therefore, we need to check if the consequent (the part after the \"then\") is also true.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that Lucy went to the zoo. This is because the conditional statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Joe's action and Lucy's action, and we know that the antecedent is true. Therefore, the consequent must also be true, meaning Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
