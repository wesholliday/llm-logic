            "content": "\nYes, we can infer 'The truck was blue' from the given statements. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement is \"The car was red.\" This implies that the car had a red color.\n2. The second statement is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue.\" This is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. Specifically, if the car was red, then the truck must have been blue.\n3. Using modus ponens, we can conclude that the truck was blue. Modus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the conclusion of a conditional statement when the premise is true. In this case, the premise is \"The car was red,\" which is true based on the first statement. Therefore, we can deduce the conclusion \"The truck was blue.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
