            "content": "\nYes, we can infer 'The banana was yellow' from the given statements. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The first statement is \"The apple was red.\" This implies that the apple had the property of being red.\n2. The second statement is \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" This is a conditional statement that implies that if the apple had the property of being red, then the banana had the property of being yellow.\n3. Since we know that the apple was red (from the first statement), we can conclude that the banana was yellow (by modus ponens). In other words, we can apply the conditional statement to the given situation and deduce that the banana had the property of being yellow.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
