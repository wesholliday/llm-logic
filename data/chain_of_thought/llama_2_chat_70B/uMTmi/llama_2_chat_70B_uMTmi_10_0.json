The statements provided do not allow us to deduce whether the dog was inside or outside. The first statement only tells us that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside, but we know that the cat might not have been outside. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the dog's location.\n\nAnswer: No",
