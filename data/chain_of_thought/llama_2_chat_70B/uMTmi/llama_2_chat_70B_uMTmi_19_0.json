This scenario satisfies both statements.\n* Scenario 2: Tom watched football, and Jen didn't watch basketball. This scenario violates the first statement.\n* Scenario 3: Tom didn't watch football, and Jen watched basketball. This scenario satisfies the second statement but violates the first statement.\n* Scenario 4: Tom didn't watch football, and Jen didn't watch basketball. This scenario satisfies neither statement.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis:\n\n* Since there are scenarios where Tom watched football and Jen watched basketball, we cannot infer that Tom did not watch football. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No",
