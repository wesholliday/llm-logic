This means that if Erin did not take a train, then Sam did not take a plane.\n* The second statement suggests that Erin might not have taken a train, which means that the conclusion from the first statement is not necessarily true.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis:\n\n* Since Erin might not have taken a train, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane. The possibility remains that Sam took a plane and Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: No",
