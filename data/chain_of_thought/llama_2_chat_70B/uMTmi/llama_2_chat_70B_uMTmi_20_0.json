However, since we know that the banana might not have been yellow, it's possible that the apple wasn't red.\n* The phrase \"the banana might not have been yellow\" doesn't provide any information about the color of the apple. It only suggests that the color of the banana is uncertain or unknown.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that the apple was not red. The statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" still holds true, even if the banana might not have been yellow. Therefore, it's possible that the apple was red, and the banana might have been a different color.\n\nAnswer: No",
