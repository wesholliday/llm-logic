            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding.\"\n* \"Sue might not have been at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the first statement\n\n* The first statement is a conditional statement. It implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the second statement\n\n* The second statement is a possibility statement. It suggests that Sue might not have been at the wedding, but it doesn't confirm whether she was or wasn't.\n\nStep 4: Combine the two statements\n\n* Since the first statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding, and the second statement suggests that Sue might not have been at the wedding, we can infer that Mary might not have been at the wedding too.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\n\n* Based on the analysis, we cannot infer that Mary was not at the wedding. The possibility that Sue might not have been at the wedding doesn't necessarily mean that Mary wasn't there. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No",
