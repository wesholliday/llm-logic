            "content": "\nStep 1: \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\" This statement implies that the vampire's awakeness is linked to the mummy's awakeness.\n\nStep 2: \"Also, the mummy might not have been awake.\" This statement introduces the possibility that the mummy was not awake, regardless of the vampire's state.\n\nStep 3: Consider both statements together. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake (according to the first statement). However, it is also possible that the mummy might not have been awake (according to the second statement).\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusions that can be drawn from the two statements. Since the mummy's awakeness is uncertain, we cannot definitively say that the vampire was not awake. The possibility remains that both the vampire and mummy were awake or that only the vampire was awake.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question. Based on the reasoning above, we cannot infer that the vampire was not awake. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
