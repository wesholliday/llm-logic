            "content": "\nStep 1: \"If the book was written by James, then the book must be a mystery novel.\"\nThis statement implies that James only writes mystery novels, so if the book is not a mystery novel, it cannot have been written by James.\n\nStep 2: \"Also, the book might not be a mystery novel.\"\nThis statement introduces the possibility that the book may not be a mystery novel, regardless of who wrote it.\n\nStep 3: Consider both statements together.\nIf the book was written by James, then it must be a mystery novel (according to the first statement). However, the second statement suggests that the book might not be a mystery novel. This creates a contradiction, as we cannot determine whether the book is or is not a mystery novel based on the information provided.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion.\nSince there is a contradiction in the information provided, we cannot infer that the book was not written by James. The possibility remains that the book was written by James and is a mystery novel, or that it was not written by James and is not a mystery novel. Therefore, the answer is \"no\" to the question of whether we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: No",
