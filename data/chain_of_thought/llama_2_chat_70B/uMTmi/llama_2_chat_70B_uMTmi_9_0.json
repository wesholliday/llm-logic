This scenario is consistent with the given information.\n* Scenario 2: Lisa did not buy the red shirt, and Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This scenario is also consistent with the given information, as Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n* Scenario 3: Lisa bought the red shirt, but Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This scenario contradicts the first statement, so it's unlikely.\n* Scenario 4: Lisa did not buy the red shirt, and Mark bought the blue shirt. This scenario is inconsistent with the second statement, as Mark might not have bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis:\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. There are still possibilities that she bought the red shirt and Mark bought the blue shirt, or that neither of them bought their respective shirts.\n\nAnswer: No",
