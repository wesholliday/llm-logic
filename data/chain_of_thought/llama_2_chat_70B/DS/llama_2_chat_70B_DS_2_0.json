Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\" - This statement presents two exclusive options for the location of the book.\n2. \"The book isn't resting on the table\" - This statement eliminates one of the options, leaving only the option that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
