The statement \"Either the milk is on the counter or it is chilling in the fridge\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the milk.\n2. The statement \"The milk isn't chilling in the fridge\" eliminates one of those options, leaving only the option that the milk is on the counter.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the milk is on the counter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
