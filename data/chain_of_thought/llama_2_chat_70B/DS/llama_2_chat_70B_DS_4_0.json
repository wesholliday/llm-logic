The statement \"Either the cat is napping on the couch or it's playing in the bedroom\" implies that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom, but not both.\n2. The statement \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom\" rules out the possibility that the cat is playing in the bedroom.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
