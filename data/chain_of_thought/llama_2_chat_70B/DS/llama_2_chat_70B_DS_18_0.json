The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand\" implies that there are only two possible locations for the notebook - the drawer or the nightstand.\n2. The statement \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" rules out one of those possibilities, leaving only the option that the notebook is in the drawer.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
