The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it is sitting on the shelf\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the toy.\n2. The statement \"The toy isn't sitting on the shelf\" eliminates one of those options, leaving only the option that the toy is in the toy box.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
