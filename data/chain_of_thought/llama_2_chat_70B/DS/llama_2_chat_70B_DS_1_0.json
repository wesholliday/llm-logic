'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden' implies that Fido can only be in one of two places: inside or in the garden.\n2. 'Fido is not in the garden' means that Fido cannot be in the garden.\n3. Since Fido cannot be in the garden, the only possible place left for Fido to be is inside.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
