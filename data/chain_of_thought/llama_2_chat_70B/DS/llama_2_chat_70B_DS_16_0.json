The statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk\" implies that the pen is either in my bag or on my desk, but not both.\n2. The statement \"The pen isn't on my desk\" tells us that the pen is not on my desk.\n3. Since the pen is not on my desk, it must be in my bag, according to the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the pen is in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
