The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the sunglasses.\n2. The statement \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\" eliminates one of those options, leaving only the option that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
