The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet\" implies that the jacket can only be in one of two places: draped over the chair or hanging in the closet.\n2. The statement \"The jacket isn't hanging in the closet\" tells us that the jacket is not in the closet.\n3. Since the jacket is not in the closet, it must be in the other possible location, which is draped over the chair.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
