The statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the scarf.\n2. The statement \"The scarf isn't draped on the coat rack\" eliminates one of those options, leaving only the option that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the scarf is indeed stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
