The statement \"Either the umbrella is tucked away in the closet or it is in the car\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the umbrella.\n2. The statement \"The umbrella isn't tucked away in the closet\" rules out one of those options, leaving only the option that the umbrella is in the car.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the umbrella is in the car.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
