The statement \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the sunglasses.\n2. The statement \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\" eliminates the first option, meaning that the sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n3. Since the sunglasses are not perched on her head, the only remaining option is that they are in her bag.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
