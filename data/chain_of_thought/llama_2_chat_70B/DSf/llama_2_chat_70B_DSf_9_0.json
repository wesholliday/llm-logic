The statement \"Either the missing puzzle piece is blending in on the floor or it is in the box\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the missing puzzle piece.\n2. The statement \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\" rules out the first option, meaning that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the missing puzzle piece must be in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
