The premise \"Either the book is resting on the table or it is on the shelf\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the book.\n2. The sentence \"The book isn't resting on the table\" negates the first option, meaning the book is not resting on the table.\n3. By process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
