The statement \"Either the watch is on his wrist or it is charging on the dresser\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the watch.\n2. The statement \"The watch isn't on his wrist\" rules out one of those options, meaning that the watch must be in the other location.\n3. Therefore, the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
