The statement \"Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the newspaper.\n2. The statement \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch\" rules out one of those options, leaving only the option that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n3.
