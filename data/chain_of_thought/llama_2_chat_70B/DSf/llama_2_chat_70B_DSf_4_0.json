The statement \"Either the cat is playing in the bedroom or it's napping on the couch\" implies that the cat is either in the bedroom playing or on the couch napping.\n2. The statement \"The cat isn't playing in the bedroom\" rules out the possibility that the cat is playing in the bedroom.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the cat is napping on the couch.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
