The statement \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the notebook.\n2. The statement \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand\" rules out one of those options, leaving only the option that the notebook is in the drawer.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
