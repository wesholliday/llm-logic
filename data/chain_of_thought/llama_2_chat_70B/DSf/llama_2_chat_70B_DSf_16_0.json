The statement \"Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag\" implies that the pen can only be in one of two places: on my desk or in my bag.\n2. The statement \"The pen isn't on my desk\" rules out the possibility that the pen is on my desk.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the pen must be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
