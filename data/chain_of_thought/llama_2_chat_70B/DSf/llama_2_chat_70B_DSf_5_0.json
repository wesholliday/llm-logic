The first premise states that the cookies are either hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar. This means that there are only two possible locations for the cookies: the pantry or the jar.\n2. The second premise states that the cookies aren't hidden in the pantry. This means that the cookies are not located in the pantry, which leaves only one possible location: the jar.\n3. Therefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
