The statement \"Either the phone is ringing in the kitchen or it is in the living room\" implies that the phone can only be in one of two places: the kitchen or the living room.\n2. The statement \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen\" means that the phone is not in the kitchen.\n3. If the phone is not in the kitchen, then it must be in the living room, since those are the only two options.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
