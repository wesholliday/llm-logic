(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\nIn this case, we are asked to determine whether we can logically conclude that Alex finished the race based on the given information. To do this, we need to evaluate whether the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Apply modus ponens to the premises to derive the conclusion.\nModus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises. It states that if \"If A then B\" and \"B,\" then we can conclude \"A.\" In this case, we have:\n\n* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. (Premise 1)\n* Chris finished the race. (Premise 2)\n\nTherefore, we can deduce:\n\n* Alex finished the race. (Conclusion)\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion to determine whether it is valid.\nBased on the premises provided, the conclusion \"Alex finished the race\" logically follows. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
