(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Identify the conclusion we want to draw:\n\nWe want to conclude that the apple was red.\n\nStep 3: Use modus ponens to deduce the conclusion:\n\nModus ponens: If A, then B. B, therefore A.\n\nIn this case, A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\". We have established that B is true (premise 2), so we can conclude that A is true, which means the apple was red.\n\nStep 4: Check for any contradictions or invalid assumptions:\n\nThere are no contradictions or invalid assumptions in this argument. The premises are logically consistent, and the conclusion follows validly from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
