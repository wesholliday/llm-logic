Therefore, Sam took a plane (conclusion)\n\nI can conclude that Sam took a plane based on the information provided because premise 1 states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train, and premise 2 confirms that Erin took a train. This means that the condition stated in premise 1 has been met, and therefore, the conclusion that Sam took a plane logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
