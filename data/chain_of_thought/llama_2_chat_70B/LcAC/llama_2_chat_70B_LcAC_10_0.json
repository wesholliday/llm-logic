The cat was outside (premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the dog was inside (conclusion)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion from the premises. The first premise states that if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside. The second premise states that the cat is indeed outside. Therefore, we can conclude that the dog must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
