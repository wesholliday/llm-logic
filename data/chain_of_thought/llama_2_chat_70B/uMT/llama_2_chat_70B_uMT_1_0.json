(\u00acSue)\n\nStep 2: Assess the validity of the conclusion\n\nThe conclusion is \"Mary was not at the wedding.\" Let's evaluate this using the given information.\n\nStep 3: Apply Modus Tollens\n\nWe know that Sue was not at the wedding (\u00acSue). If we assume that Mary was at the wedding (Mary), then we can apply modus tollens to deduce that Sue would have been at the wedding (Sue), which contradicts our given information.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince our assumption (Mary) led to a contradiction, we must conclude that Mary was not at the wedding (\u00acMary).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
