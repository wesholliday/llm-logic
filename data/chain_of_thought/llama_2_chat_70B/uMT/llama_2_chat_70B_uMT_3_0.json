The book is not a mystery novel.\n\nStep 2: Let's analyze each part separately:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel: This statement implies that James only writes mystery novels.\n2. The book is not a mystery novel: This statement indicates that the book does not belong to the mystery genre.\n\nStep 3: Now, let's combine the two parts and consider the possibilities:\n\nIf the book was written by James, then it should be a mystery novel, but it's not. This means that either James didn't write the book or the book is not a mystery novel, which contradicts our first statement.\n\nStep 4: Conclusion: Based on the given information, we can infer that the book was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
