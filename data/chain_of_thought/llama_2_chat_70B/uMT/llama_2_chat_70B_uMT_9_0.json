To do this, we need to evaluate whether the given information logically leads to this conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Work backwards from the conclusion:\n\n* Suppose Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n* If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt (since the premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt).\n* Since Mark did not buy the blue shirt, this supports the idea that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 4: Check for any contradictions or inconsistencies:\n\n* There are no contradictions or inconsistencies in the reasoning above.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion:\n\nBased on the given information, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
