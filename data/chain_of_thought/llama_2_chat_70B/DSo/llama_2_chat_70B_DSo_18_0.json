The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it is sitting on the nightstand\" implies that the notebook can only be in one of two places: the drawer or the nightstand.\n2. We know that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, based on the statement \"The notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand.\"\n3. Therefore, since the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, it must be in the other possible location, which is the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
