The statement \"The phone isn't ringing in the kitchen\" implies that the phone is not in the kitchen.\n2. The statement \"Either the phone is in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen\" presents two exclusive options: the phone is either in the living room or it is ringing in the kitchen.\n3. Since we know that the phone is not in the kitchen (from step 1), we can conclude that the phone must be in the living room.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
