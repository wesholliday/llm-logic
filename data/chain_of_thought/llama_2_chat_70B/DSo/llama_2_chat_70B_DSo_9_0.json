The statement \"The missing puzzle piece isn't blending in on the floor\" implies that the missing puzzle piece is not camouflaged or hidden on the floor, but rather it is not present on the floor at all.\n2. The statement \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it is blending in on the floor\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the missing puzzle piece: it is either inside the box or it is blending in on the floor.\n3. Since we know that the missing puzzle piece is not blending in on the floor, we can eliminate the second option, leaving us with the first option: the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
