The statement \"The missing sock isn't under the bed\" implies that the speaker has checked under the bed and did not find the missing sock.\n2. The statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the missing sock.\n3. Since the speaker has already checked under the bed and did not find the missing sock, it means that the missing sock cannot be under the bed.\n4. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
