The premise \"Either the shoes are in the closet or they are lined up by the door\" implies that there are only two possible locations for the shoes: the closet or by the door.\n2. We know that the shoes are not lined up by the door, so we can eliminate that option.\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
