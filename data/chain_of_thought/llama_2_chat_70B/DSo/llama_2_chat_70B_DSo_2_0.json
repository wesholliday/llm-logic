The statement \"Either the book is on the shelf or it is resting on the table\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the book: either it is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n3. Since the book is not resting on the table, according to the first statement, it must be on the shelf, as it is the only remaining option.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion that can be drawn from the two premises is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
