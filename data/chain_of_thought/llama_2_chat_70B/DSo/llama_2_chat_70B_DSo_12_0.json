The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet\" implies that the jacket is either draped over the chair or it is hanging in the closet, but not both.\n2. We know that the jacket isn't hanging in the closet, so the only remaining option is that it is draped over the chair.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the jacket is draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
