The statement \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" means that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n2. The statement \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the cookies: either they are in the jar or they are hidden in the pantry.\n3. Since we know that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry (from step 1), we can eliminate the second option, which means that the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given statements is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
