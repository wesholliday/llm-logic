            "content": "\nYes, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. The statement \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" means that the keys are not located in the cabinet.\n2. The statement \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the keys: either they are in the drawer or they are dangling in the cabinet.\n3. Since we know that the keys are not dangling in the cabinet (from step 1), we can conclude that they must be in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
