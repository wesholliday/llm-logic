'Either Fido is inside or Fido is in the garden' is a disjunction that states that Fido can be in one of two places: inside or in the garden.\n3. Since Fido is not in the garden, according to premise 1, we can eliminate the second option 'Fido is in the garden'.\n4. Therefore, by process of elimination, Fido must be inside, which means that 'Fido is inside' is a valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
