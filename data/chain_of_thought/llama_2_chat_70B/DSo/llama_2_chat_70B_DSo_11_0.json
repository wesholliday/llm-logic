The statement \"The newspaper isn't sitting on the porch\" means that the newspaper is not located on the porch.\n2. The statement \"Either the newspaper is in the driveway or it is sitting on the porch\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the newspaper: the driveway or the porch.\n3. Since we know that the newspaper is not located on the porch (from step 1), we can conclude that it must be located in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
