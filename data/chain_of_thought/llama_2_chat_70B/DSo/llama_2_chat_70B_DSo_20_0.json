The sentence \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\" tells us that the sunglasses are not located on her head.\n2. The sentence \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they are perched on her head\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the sunglasses: either they are in her bag or they are perched on her head.\n3. Since we know that the sunglasses are not perched on her head (from step 1), we can conclude that they must be in her bag, which is the only remaining option.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: Yes",
