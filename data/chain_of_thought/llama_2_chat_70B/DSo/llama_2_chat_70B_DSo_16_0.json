The statement \"Either the pen is in my bag or it is on my desk\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the pen: either it's in the bag or it's on the desk.\n3. Since we know that the pen is not on the desk (from step 1), we can conclude that it must be in the bag, as it's the only remaining option.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The pen is in my bag\" logically follows from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
