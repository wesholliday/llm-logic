The second statement says that either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it is draped on the coat rack.\n3. Since the scarf isn't draped on the coat rack, according to premise 1, it must be true that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack, as per the second statement.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is that the scarf is indeed stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
