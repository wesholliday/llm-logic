(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\nIn this case, we are trying to deduce whether \"The apple was red\" can be logically concluded from the given premises.\n\nStep 3: Apply modus ponens to the premises to derive a conclusion.\nModus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to conclude that if \"If A then B\" and \"B\", then \"A\".\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n* If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. (Premise 1)\n* The banana was yellow. (Premise 2)\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that:\n\n* The apple was red.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion for validity.\nThe conclusion \"The apple was red\" logically follows from the premises \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and \"The banana was yellow\". Therefore, the conclusion is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
