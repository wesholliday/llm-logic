(condition)\n* ...Lucy went to the zoo. (consequence)\n\nStep 3: Consider the truth of the consequence.\n\n* Lucy went to the zoo (given).\n\nStep 4: Use modus ponens to deduce the truth of the condition.\n\n* If the consequence is true, then the condition must be true.\n* Therefore, Joe went to the park.\n\nStep 5: Verify the answer.\n\n* Answer: Yes.\n\nNote: Modus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the truth of a statement from the truth of its consequence. It is a fundamental rule in propositional logic and can be used to build more complex arguments.",
