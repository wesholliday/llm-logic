The book is a mystery novel. (Given)\n3. Therefore, the book was written by James. (Conclusion)\n\nThe argument follows the form of modus ponens, where we have a conditional statement (\"If the book was written by James, then it's a mystery novel\") and its consequent (\"the book is a mystery novel\"), which allows us to deduce the antecedent (\"the book was written by James\").",
