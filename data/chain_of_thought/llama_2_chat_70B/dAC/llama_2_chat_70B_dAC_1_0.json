Therefore, Mary was at the wedding (conclusion)\n\nI have used modus ponens to deduce the conclusion from the two given premises. Modus ponens is a valid form of reasoning that allows us to conclude that if a hypothesis (in this case, \"Mary was at the wedding\") leads to a conclusion (in this case, \"Sue was at the wedding\"), and the conclusion is known to be true, then the hypothesis must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
