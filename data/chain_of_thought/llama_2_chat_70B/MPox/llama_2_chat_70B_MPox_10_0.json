It suggests that whenever the wug is sproinged, it will always be garpled.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the reasoning\n\nBased on the given information, we can infer that the wug was indeed sproinged (since we are told so in the first statement). Therefore, applying the conditional statement, we can conclude that the wug was garpled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nAnswer: Yes. We can infer \"It was garpled\" based on the given information.",
