The statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" implies that the missing sock can only be in one of two places: the laundry basket or under the bed.\n2. The phrase \"might not be under the bed\" suggests that the possibility exists that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n3. If the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket, as it is the only other possible location.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
