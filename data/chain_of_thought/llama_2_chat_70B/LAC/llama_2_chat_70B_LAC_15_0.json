In this case, the statement implies that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. However, it does not guarantee that Sam took a plane.\n\nStep 3: Consider the second statement and determine whether it provides enough evidence to support the conclusion.\n\nThe second statement simply states that Erin took a train. This information does not directly relate to Sam's mode of transportation.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether the combination of the two statements provides sufficient evidence to logically infer the conclusion.\n\nSince the first statement does not guarantee that Sam took a plane, and the second statement does not provide any information about Sam's mode of transportation, there is insufficient evidence to logically infer that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: No",
