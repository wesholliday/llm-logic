            "content": "\nStep 1: Write down the given information in a clear and concise way.\n\n* If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\n* Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the first statement.\n\n* The first statement is a conditional statement with an if-then structure. It implies that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the second statement.\n\n* The second statement simply states that Lucy went to the zoo. This information doesn't directly relate to Joe's whereabouts.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether we can logically infer \"Joe went to the park\" based on the given information.\n\n* Since the first statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo, and we know that Lucy went to the zoo (from the second statement), we can conclude that the condition \"Joe went to the park\" must have been true. Therefore, we can logically infer \"Joe went to the park.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
