This means that Amy played tennis, which is consistent with the second statement.\n* Scenario 2: Jeff did not play basketball.\n\t+ In this scenario, the premise of the first statement is false, which means that the conclusion (Amy played tennis) does not have to be true. However, the second statement still states that Amy played tennis, which means that this scenario is also consistent with the given information.\n\nStep 4: Based on the analysis, determine whether the conclusion can be logically inferred.\n\n* Since both scenarios are consistent with the given information, we cannot logically infer that Jeff played basketball. The conclusion is not necessarily true, and we need more information to make a definitive statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
