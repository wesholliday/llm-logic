(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises.\n\n* Premise 1 states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue. This means that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n* Premise 2 states that the truck was blue. This means that the truck satisfies the condition of being blue, which was stated in Premise 1 as a consequence of the car being red.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\n* Since Premise 2 states that the truck was blue, and Premise 1 states that if the car was red, then the truck was blue, we can logically infer that the car was red.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
