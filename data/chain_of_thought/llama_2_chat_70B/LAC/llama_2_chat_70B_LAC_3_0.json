If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (This is the first premise.)\n2. The book is a mystery novel. (This is the second premise.)\n3. Therefore, the book was written by James. (Conclusion)\n\nThe reasoning is based on modus ponens, which is a basic rule of logic that states: If A implies B, and B is true, then A must be true. In this case, A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel\". Since we know that B is true, we can conclude that A must also be true, therefore the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
