The cat was outside (premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the dog was inside (conclusion)\n\nThe argument follows the form of a valid deductive argument, Modus Ponens, which has the following form:\n\n1. If A, then B\n2. B\n3. Therefore, A\n\nIn this case, A is \"the dog was inside\" and B is \"the cat was outside\". Premise 1 states that if A is true, then B must be true. Premise 2 asserts that B is indeed true. Therefore, we can logically conclude that A must be true, which means the dog was inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
