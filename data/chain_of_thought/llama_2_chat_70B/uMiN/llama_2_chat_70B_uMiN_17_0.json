If it were certain that the scarf must be in your backpack, then the phrase \"might not\" would not be used. Instead, we would say \"is not\" or \"cannot be.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the language used, we can infer that it's possible that the scarf is not in your backpack, and thus we cannot conclude that it must be there.",
