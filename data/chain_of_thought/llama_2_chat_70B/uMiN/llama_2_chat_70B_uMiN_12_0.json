If it's possible that the jacket is not draped over the chair, then it's also possible that the jacket must be draped over the chair (i.e., the negation of \"the jacket might not be draped over the chair\" is \"the jacket must be draped over the chair\").\n3. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: No",
