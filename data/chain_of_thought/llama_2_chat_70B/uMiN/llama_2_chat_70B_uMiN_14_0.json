The statement \"the milk might not be on the counter\" implies that the milk's location is uncertain or unknown.\n2. If the milk's location were certain, we would know whether it's on the counter or not.\n3. Since we don't know whether the milk is on the counter, we can infer that it's not necessarily on the counter.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that it's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.",
