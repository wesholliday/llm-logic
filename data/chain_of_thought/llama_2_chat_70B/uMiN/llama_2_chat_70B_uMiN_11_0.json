In other words, there is a possibility that the newspaper might not be in the driveway.\n\nIf the newspaper must be in the driveway, then its absence would be impossible or contradictory. However, since we know that the newspaper might not be in the driveway, it means that its absence is possible, and therefore, it's not necessary for the newspaper to be in the driveway.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that it's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.",
