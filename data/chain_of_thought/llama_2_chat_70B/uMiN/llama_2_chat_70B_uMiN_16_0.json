If the speaker is uncertain about the location of the pen, it means that they have not checked their bag to confirm whether the pen is inside.\n3. If the speaker has not checked their bag, then they cannot know for certain whether the pen is in their bag or not.\n4. Therefore, based on the statement \"the pen might not be in my bag,\" we can infer that the speaker does not have certain knowledge about the location of the pen.\n5. Since the speaker does not have certain knowledge about the location of the pen, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the pen must be in their bag.\n\nAnswer: No",
