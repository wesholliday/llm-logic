In this case, we cannot infer that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nStep 4: Consider alternative possibilities.\nThere are other possible reasons why the alien might not have visited Mars, such as the alien not existing or not having the capability to travel to Mars.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\nSince there are alternative possibilities that explain why the alien might not have visited Mars, and since we cannot infer that the alien must have visited Mars, the answer is no, we cannot infer that it's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: No",
