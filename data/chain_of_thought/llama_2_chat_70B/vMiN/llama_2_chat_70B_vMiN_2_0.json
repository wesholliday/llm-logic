The word \"might\" indicates possibility, which means that the statement is not necessarily true or false.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.\"\n4. The word \"must\" implies necessity, which means that the statement is definitely true or false.\n5. Since the premise states that the griffin might not have been in the forest, it does not necessarily mean that it must not have been in the forest.\n6. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
