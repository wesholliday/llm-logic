The premise of the argument is \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt.\" This means that it's possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but it's also possible that she did.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt.\" This means that it's not necessarily true that Lisa bought the red shirt, but it's also possible that she did.\n3. The argument is structured as a modus tollens, with the premise being the possibility that Lisa didn't buy the red shirt, and the conclusion being the negation of the necessity that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n4. Modus tollens is a valid logical form, so if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
