The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that the milk must be on the counter.\"\n3. The argument is structured as a modus tollens, with the premise being the antecedent and the conclusion being the consequent.\n4. Modus tollens is a valid logical form, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must be true.\n5. The premise \"The milk might not be on the counter\" is ambiguous and could be interpreted in two ways:\n\t* It might be true that the milk is not on the counter (in which case the conclusion would also be true).\n\t* It might be false that the milk is not on the counter (in which case the conclusion would be false).\n6. Therefore, without additional information or context, it's impossible to determine whether the argument is logically valid or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
