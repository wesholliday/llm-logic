In other words, if the premise is true, does it guarantee that the conclusion is also true?\n\nIf the vampire might not have been awake (premise), then it's possible that the vampire was not awake. If the vampire was not awake, then it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake (conclusion). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the argument is valid.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
