The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.\"\n3. The argument is structured as a modus tollens, with the premise being the antecedent and the conclusion being the consequent.\n4. Modus tollens is a valid logical form, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must be true.\n5. The premise \"The pen might not be in my bag\" is a possibility claim, which means that it asserts the existence of a possible world where the pen is not in the speaker's bag.\n6. The conclusion \"It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag\" can be interpreted as a negation of a necessity claim, which means that it asserts the non-existence of a necessary connection between the pen being in the speaker's bag and some other fact or proposition.\n7. Since possibility claims and necessity claims are contradictory, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
