            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The premise of the argument is \"Mary might not have been at the wedding.\" This means that it's possible that Mary did not attend the wedding.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\" This means that it's not necessary or certain that Mary attended the wedding.\n3. The argument is structured as a modus tollens, with the premise being the possibility that Mary didn't attend the wedding and the conclusion being the negation of the necessity that Mary attended the wedding.\n4. Modus tollens is a valid logical form, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because if the premise \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" is true, then the conclusion \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
