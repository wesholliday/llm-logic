The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James.\"\n3. The argument is structured as a modus tollens, with the premise being the antecedent and the conclusion being the consequent.\n4. Modus tollens is a valid logical form, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n5. The premise \"The book might not have been written by James\" is ambiguous and could be interpreted in two ways:\n\t* It might not have been written by James (i.e., it was written by someone else).\n\t* It might not have been written at all (i.e., it doesn't exist).\n6. If we interpret the premise as \"It might not have been written by James (i.e., it was written by someone else),\" then the conclusion \"It's not the case that the book must have been written by James\" follows logically.\n7. However, if we interpret the premise as \"It might not have been written at all (i.e., it doesn't exist),\" then the conclusion does not follow logically, because the absence of evidence for the book's existence does not necessarily mean that it was not written by James.\n8. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid, because the premise is ambiguous and can be interpreted in multiple ways, leading to different conclusions.\n\nAnswer: No",
