The premise of the argument is \"Sue might not have chosen pizza.\" This means that it's possible that Sue did not choose pizza, but it's also possible that she did choose pizza.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that Sue must have chosen pizza.\" This means that it's not necessarily true that Sue chose pizza, but it's also possible that she did choose pizza.\n3. The argument is structured as a modus tollens, with the premise being the possibility that Sue might not have chosen pizza, and the conclusion being the negation of the necessity that Sue must have chosen pizza.\n4. Modus tollens is a valid logical form, so if the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
