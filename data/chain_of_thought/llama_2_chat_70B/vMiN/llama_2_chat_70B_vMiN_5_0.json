The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that Jeff must have played basketball.\" This means that it's not necessary or certain that Jeff played basketball.\n3. The conclusion follows logically from the premise. If it's possible that Jeff didn't play basketball, then it's not necessary that he did play basketball.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
