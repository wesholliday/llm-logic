The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\"\n3. The argument is structured as a modus tollens, with the premise being the possibility that the newspaper might not be in the driveway, and the conclusion being the negation of the necessity that the newspaper must be in the driveway.\n4. Modus tollens is a valid logical form, where if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
