The conclusion of the argument is \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\"\n3. The argument is structured as a modus tollens, with the premise being the antecedent and the conclusion being the consequent.\n4. Modus tollens is a valid logical form, which means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must be true.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
