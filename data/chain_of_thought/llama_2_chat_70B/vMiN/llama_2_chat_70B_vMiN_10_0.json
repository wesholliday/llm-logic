In other words, is it impossible for the conclusion to be true if the premise is true?\n\nIf the dog might not have been inside (premise), then it's possible that the dog was not inside. If it's possible that the dog was not inside, then it's not necessary that the dog must have been inside (conclusion).\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premise, the argument is valid.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
