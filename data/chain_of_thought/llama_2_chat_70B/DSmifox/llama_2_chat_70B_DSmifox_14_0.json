However, \"Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked\" implies that if the clug is not snugged, then it must be fleeked.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the two statements, we can infer that if the clug is not snugged, then it is fleeked. Therefore, \"The clug is fleeked\" can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
