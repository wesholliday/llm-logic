However, if we combine this statement with \"Either the shank must be nugged or it is plooked,\" we can infer that if the shank isn't nugged, then it must be plooked.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that \"The shank is plooked\" can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
