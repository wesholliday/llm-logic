The first statement, on the other hand, suggests that the sneg might not have the property of being sproted.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that if the sneg is not sproted, then it must be crampled. This is because the second statement eliminates the possibility of the sneg having neither property, leaving only the option of being crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
