It could be smoogled, or it might not be.\n* \"Either the zinger must be smoogled or it is fraggled\" indicates that there are only two possible states for the zinger: smoogled or fraggled. There is no middle ground.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\nIf the zinger might not be smoogled, then it means that there is a possibility that it is not smoogled. In that case, according to the second statement, the zinger must be fraggled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the zinger is fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
