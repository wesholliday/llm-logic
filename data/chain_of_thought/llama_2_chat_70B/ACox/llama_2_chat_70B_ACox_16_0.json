However, we can use the conditional statement to infer that if the grommet was plopped, then it must have been sploffed beforehand. This is because the conditional statement implies that sploffing precedes plopping.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the grommet was sploffed before it was plopped. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
