In other words, if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have been crinked.\n\nStep 3: Use modus ponens to draw a conclusion\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that if the fribble was crinked (premise 1), and if the fribble was snurgled, then it was crinked (premise 2), then we can infer that the fribble was snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
