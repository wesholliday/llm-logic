            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"The splat was quanked\" - This statement indicates that the splat was in a certain state or condition, specifically quanked.\n* \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat was quanked\" - This statement is a conditional sentence that implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the splat being morphed and the splat being quanked.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nBased on the given information, we can identify a logical connection between the two statements. The second statement provides a condition (the splat was morphed) that leads to a conclusion (the splat was quanked), which is consistent with the first statement (the splat was quanked).\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nUsing modus ponens, a form of logical inference, we can conclude that the splat was indeed morphed. This is because we know that the splat was quanked (from the first statement), and if the splat was morphed, then it would be quanked (from the second statement). Therefore, the premises suggest that the splat was morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
