            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"The fribble crinked\" - This statement indicates that the fribble is in a crinked state.\n* \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" - This statement implies that snurgling the fribble leads to the fribble being in a crinked state.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nBased on the second statement, we can infer that snurgling the fribble is sufficient to cause the fribble to crink. In other words, if the fribble was snurgled, then it must have crinked.\n\nStep 3: Use modus ponens to draw a conclusion\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that the fribble was snurgled. Modus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises:\n\n1. If A implies B, and\n2. B is true,\nthen A must be true.\n\nIn this case, A is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and B is \"the fribble crinked\". Since we know that the fribble crinked (B), and we have a statement that implies snurgling the fribble leads to the fribble crinked (A implies B), we can deduce that the fribble was snurgled (A).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
