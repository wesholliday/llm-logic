This means that if the dreb was not vroombed, then it's possible that it wasn't spended.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed, because if it was, then it must have been spended, but we know that it might or might not have been spended. Therefore, the conclusion is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
