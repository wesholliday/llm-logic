However, the first statement only tells us that the shank being nugged is not a necessary condition. It doesn't provide any information about the possibility of the shank being plooked.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we cannot infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from the given statements. The first statement does not provide enough information to make any conclusions about the shank being plooked or not. The second statement only tells us that if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged, but we don't know whether the shank was actually plooked or not. Therefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
