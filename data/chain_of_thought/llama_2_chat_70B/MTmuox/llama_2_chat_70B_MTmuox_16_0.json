The first statement, on the other hand, is a negation of a necessity statement, which means it asserts that the sneg did not necessarily sprot the frink.\n\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion\n\nWe can infer the conclusion \"The sneg was not crampled\" by combining the two statements. If the sneg was crampled, then according to the second statement, it must have sproted the frink. However, the first statement asserts that it's not the case that the sneg must have sproted the frink. Therefore, we can conclude that the sneg was not crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
