However, the first statement only tells us that the fleeg not being surned is a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the fleeg was bluttered.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that if the fleeg was not bluttered, then it's possible that it was not surned. However, we cannot conclusively say that the fleeg was not bluttered based on the given statements. Therefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
