This means that if we assume the first statement is true, then the second statement's antecedent becomes false, which makes the entire conditional statement false.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the relationship between the two statements.\n\nSince the second statement is false, we can conclude that its antecedent (Sploffed Grommet) must be false as well. This means that the grommet was not sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
