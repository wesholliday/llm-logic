However, the first statement states that the smonk's plagging is not necessary, which means that the smonk might not have plagged even if it was vreebled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled. If the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged according to the second statement. However, since the first statement states that the smonk's plagging is not necessary, it means that the smonk might not have plagged even if it was vreebled. Therefore, the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
