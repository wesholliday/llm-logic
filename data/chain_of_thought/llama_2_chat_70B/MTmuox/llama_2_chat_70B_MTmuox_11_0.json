If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed, which means that the flug not being zimmed is not a possibility. Therefore, the first statement is true.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the flug was not blummed. If the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed, but since the flug not being zimmed is not a possibility, the flug must not have been blummed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
