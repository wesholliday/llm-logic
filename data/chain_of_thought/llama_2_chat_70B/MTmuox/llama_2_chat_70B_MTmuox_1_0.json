However, the first statement states that the flugel not being zargled is not a necessary condition, which means that the flugel could still have been blimmed even if it wasn't zargled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed, because if it had been blimmed, then it must have also been zargled, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, the flugel must have not been blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
