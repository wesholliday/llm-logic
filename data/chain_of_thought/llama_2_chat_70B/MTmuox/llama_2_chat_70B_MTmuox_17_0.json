However, the first statement states that the flob's movement is not necessary.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled, because if it were, then it would have moved, but since its movement is not necessary, it must not have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
