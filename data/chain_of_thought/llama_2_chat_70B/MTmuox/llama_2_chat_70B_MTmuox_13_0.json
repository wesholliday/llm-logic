Now, let's consider two possible scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The glip was slogged\nIn this scenario, the glip must have tragged, according to the second statement. But this contradicts the first statement, which says that it's not necessary that the glip tragged. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.\n\nScenario 2: The glip was not slogged\nIn this scenario, the glip may or may not have tragged, according to the first statement. This scenario is consistent with both statements, as the glip may have tragged or not tragged, and we don't know whether it was slogged or not.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the glip was not slogged. This is because Scenario 1 is impossible, and Scenario 2 is consistent with both statements. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
