However, the first statement states that it's not necessary for the sprocket to have been daggled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the relationship between the statements, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked. If the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled, but since it's not necessary for the sprocket to have been daggled, it means that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
