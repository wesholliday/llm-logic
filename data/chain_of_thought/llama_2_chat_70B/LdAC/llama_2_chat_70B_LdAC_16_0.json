If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (given statement)\n2. The pants were denim (given statement)\n3. Therefore, the shirt was cotton (conclusion)\n\nThe argument follows the form of a valid deductive argument, Modus Ponens, which states that if \"If A then B\" and \"B\", then \"A\". In this case, A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim\". The first statement implies that whenever the shirt is cotton, the pants are denim. The second statement confirms that the pants are indeed denim. Therefore, we can logically deduce that the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
