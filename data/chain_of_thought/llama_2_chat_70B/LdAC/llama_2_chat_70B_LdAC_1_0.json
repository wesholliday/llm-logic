(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two premises.\n\nPremise 1 states that Mary's presence at the wedding implies Sue's presence. Premise 2 confirms that Sue was indeed present at the wedding.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce that if Premise 1 implies Premise 2, and Premise 2 is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the conclusion is \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
