(Premise 1)\n* The robot visited Jupiter. (Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two premises.\n\n* Premise 1 states a conditional relationship between the alien visiting Mars and the robot visiting Jupiter.\n* Premise 2 asserts that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible scenarios that could have occurred.\n\n* Scenario 1: The alien visited Mars, which means the robot visited Jupiter (according to Premise 1). In this scenario, both premises are true.\n* Scenario 2: The alien did not visit Mars, which means the robot did not visit Jupiter (according to Premise 1). In this scenario, Premise 2 is false.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\n* Since both premises are true in Scenario 1, and Scenario 2 leads to a contradiction (Premise 2 is false), we can conclude that the alien visited Mars.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
