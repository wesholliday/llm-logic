(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises.\n\n* Premise 1 states a conditional relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den.\n* Premise 2 states that the wolf was indeed in the den.\n\nStep 3: Use modus ponens to deduce a conclusion.\n\n* Modus ponens: If A implies B, and B is true, then A must be true.\n* In this case, A is \"the bear was in the cave\" and B is \"the wolf was in the den\".\n* Since Premise 2 states that B is true, we can deduce that A must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
