(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two premises.\n\n* Premise 1 states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. This means that if we know Alex finished the race, we can conclude that Chris finished the race.\n* Premise 2 states that Chris finished the race. This gives us information about Chris's status, but it doesn't directly relate to Alex's status.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether we can logically deduce the conclusion from the premises.\n\n* Based on Premise 1, if we know that Alex finished the race, then we can conclude that Chris finished the race. However, we don't have direct information about Alex's status.\n* Premise 2 only provides information about Chris's status and doesn't help us deduce anything about Alex's status.\n* Therefore, we cannot logically deduce \"Alex finished the race\" from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
