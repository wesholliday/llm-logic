The truck was blue (given statement)\n3. Therefore, the car was red (logical deduction)\n\nThe first statement establishes a conditional relationship between the car's color and the truck's color. The second statement confirms that the truck's color is blue. By modus ponens, we can conclude that the car's color is red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
