(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two premises.\n\nPremise 1 states that the vampire's awakeness is dependent on the mummy's awakeness. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake.\n\nPremise 2 directly states that the mummy was awake.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nUsing Modus Ponens, we can deduce that if Premise 1 is true and Premise 2 is true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, the conclusion is \"The vampire was awake.\"\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
