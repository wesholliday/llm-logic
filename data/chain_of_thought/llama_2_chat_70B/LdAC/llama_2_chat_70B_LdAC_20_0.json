The banana was yellow (premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the apple was red (conclusion)\n\nThe reasoning is based on modus ponens, a basic rule of logic that states: If A implies B, and B is true, then A must be true. In this case, A is \"the apple was red\" and B is \"the banana was yellow\". Premise 1 states that A implies B, and premise 2 states that B is true. Therefore, we can conclude that A is true, which means the apple was red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
