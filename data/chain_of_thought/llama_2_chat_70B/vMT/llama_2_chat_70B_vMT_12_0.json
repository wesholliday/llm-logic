            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\nPremise 2: Lucy did not go to the zoo.\nConclusion: Joe did not go to the park.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\n\nThis argument is a modus tollens, which is a type of deductive argument that uses the first premise to reach a conclusion by negating the second premise. The formula for modus tollens is:\n\nModus Tollens:\n\n1. If A, then B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, not A.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument's validity\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true.\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. This means that if Joe went to the park, Lucy's going to the zoo is guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise: Lucy did not go to the zoo. This statement negates the guarantee established by the first premise. If Lucy didn't go to the zoo, then it's possible that Joe didn't go to the park, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nGiven these two premises, we can conclude that Joe did not go to the park. This conclusion logically follows from the premises because if the first premise guarantees Lucy's presence at the zoo given Joe's presence at the park, and the second premise states that Lucy didn't go to the zoo, then it's reasonable to infer that Joe didn't go to the park.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
