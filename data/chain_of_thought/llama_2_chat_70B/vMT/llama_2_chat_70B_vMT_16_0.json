This means that if the shirt was cotton, we can conclude that the pants were denim.\n2. The second premise states that the pants were not denim. This means that we know the pants were not denim, regardless of whether the shirt was cotton or not.\n3. The conclusion is that the shirt was not cotton. This follows logically from the first premise and the second premise. If the shirt was cotton, then the pants would have been denim, but since the pants were not denim, we can conclude that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
