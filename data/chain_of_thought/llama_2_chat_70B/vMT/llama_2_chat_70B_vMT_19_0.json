The argument is a conditional argument, with the first premise stating a conditional relationship between Tom watching football and Jen watching basketball.\n2. The second premise states that Jen did not watch basketball.\n3. If the first premise is true, then the conclusion must be true, because if Tom watched football, then Jen would have watched basketball, but since she didn't, Tom cannot have watched football.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
