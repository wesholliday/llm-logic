This means that if the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then the condition \"Kate ate salad\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Kate did not eat salad. This means that the condition \"Kate ate salad\" is false.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that Ben did not eat pasta. This is logically deduced from the first premise and the second premise. If the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then according to the first premise, the condition \"Kate ate salad\" must also be true. However, since we know that Kate did not eat salad (from the second premise), it means that the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" cannot be true, and therefore Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
