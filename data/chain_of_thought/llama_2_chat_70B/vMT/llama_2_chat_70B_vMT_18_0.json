This means that if the doll was plastic, we can conclude that the truck was metal.\n2. The second premise states that the truck was not metal. This means that we know the truck was not made of metal.\n3. The conclusion is that the doll was not plastic. This is based on the first premise and the fact that the truck was not metal. If the doll was plastic, then the truck would have been metal, but since the truck is not metal, we can conclude that the doll was not plastic.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the argument is logically valid. The conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
