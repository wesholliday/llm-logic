This means that if the car was red, we can conclude that the truck was blue.\n2. The second premise states that the truck was not blue. This means that we know the truck's color is not blue.\n3. The conclusion is that the car was not red. This is based on the first premise and the fact that the truck's color is not blue. If the car was red, then the truck would have been blue, but since the truck is not blue, we can conclude that the car was not red.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the argument is logically valid because it follows a logical pattern and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
