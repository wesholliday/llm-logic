This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\n2. The second premise states that Chris did not finish the race. This means that the condition in the first premise, \"if Alex finished the race,\" is false.\n3. Therefore, using modus tollens, we can conclude that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
