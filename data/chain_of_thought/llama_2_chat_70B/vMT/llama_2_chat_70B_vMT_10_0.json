This means that if the dog was inside, the cat must be outside.\n2. The second premise states that the cat was not outside. This means that the cat cannot be outside.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that the dog was not inside. This is logically valid because if the cat cannot be outside (second premise), and the dog cannot be inside if the cat is outside (first premise), then the dog must not be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
