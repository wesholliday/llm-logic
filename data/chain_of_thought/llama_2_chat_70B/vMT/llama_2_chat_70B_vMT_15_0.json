This means that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Erin did not take a train. This means that the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" cannot be true.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that Sam did not take a plane. This follows logically from the first premise and the second premise, since if Erin did not take a train, then the condition \"Sam took a plane\" cannot be true, and therefore the conclusion \"Sam did not take a plane\" must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
