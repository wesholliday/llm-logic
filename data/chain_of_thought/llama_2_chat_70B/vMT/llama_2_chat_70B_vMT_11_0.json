The basic structure of a modus tollens argument is:\n\nIf A, then B.\nNot B.\nTherefore, not A.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument for logical validity\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true: If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry. This means that if the cake was chocolate, then it is necessarily true that the muffins were blueberry.\n\nNow, consider the second premise: The muffins were not blueberry. This statement negates the conclusion of the first premise, which means that the muffins being blueberry is impossible.\n\nGiven these two premises, we can conclude that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins would have been blueberry, but since they were not blueberry, it is impossible for the cake to have been chocolate. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
