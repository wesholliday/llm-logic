            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the argument format\nThe argument has the following format:\n\nIf A, then B\nNot B\nTherefore, not A\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the premises\n\nPremise 1: If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den\nThis premise states a conditional relationship between the bear being in the cave and the wolf being in the den. It does not guarantee that the bear was actually in the cave or that the wolf was actually in the den, but rather establishes a logical connection between the two statements.\n\nPremise 2: The wolf was not in the den\nThis premise states a fact about the wolf's location, asserting that it was not in the den.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion\nThe conclusion is logically deduced from the premises using modus tollens, which is a valid form of reasoning. Modus tollens states that if \"If A, then B\" and \"not B,\" then \"not A.\" In this case, the argument follows this format, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument\nBased on the above analysis, the argument is logically valid because its conclusion follows logically from its premises using a valid form of reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
