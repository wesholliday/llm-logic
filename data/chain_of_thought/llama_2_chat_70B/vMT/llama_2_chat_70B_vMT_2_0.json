In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true: If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nIf the second premise is false, then the unicorn was in the forest, which means that the griffin must also be in the forest (according to the first premise). This would contradict the conclusion that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nTherefore, the only way for the conclusion to be true is if the second premise is true, which means that the unicorn was not in the forest. In this case, the conclusion that the griffin was not in the forest logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
