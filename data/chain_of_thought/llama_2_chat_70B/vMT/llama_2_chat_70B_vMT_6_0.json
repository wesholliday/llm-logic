This means that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Bob did not choose pasta. This means that the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" from the first premise cannot be true.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that Sue did not choose pizza. This follows logically from the first premise and the second premise, since if Sue chose pizza, then Bob would have chosen pasta, but Bob did not choose pasta. Therefore, Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
