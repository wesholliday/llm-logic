            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt.\nPremise 2: Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\nConclusion: Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\n\nThis argument is a conditional argument, specifically a modus tollens argument. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Lisa buying the red shirt and Mark buying the blue shirt. The second premise states that the condition in the first premise (Mark buying the blue shirt) did not occur. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument for validity\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to assess whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does logically follow from the premises. If the first premise is true and Mark did not buy the blue shirt (as stated in the second premise), then it is impossible for Lisa to have bought the red shirt, as the first premise states that if she did, Mark would have bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
