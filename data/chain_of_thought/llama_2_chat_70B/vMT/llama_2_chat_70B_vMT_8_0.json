            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the argument format\nThe argument has the following format:\n\nIf A, then B\nNot B\nTherefore, not A\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the premises\n\nPremise 1: If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\nThis premise is stating a conditional relationship between the vampire and mummy's state of being awake. It implies that if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\n\nPremise 2: The mummy was not awake\nThis premise states the negation of the second part of the conditional statement in Premise 1. It means that the mummy was not awake.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion\nThe conclusion is logically deduced from the two premises. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must be awake (Premise 1). However, the mummy was not awake (Premise 2), therefore, the vampire cannot be awake.\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument\nThe argument follows the format of a modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
