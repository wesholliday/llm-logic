In other words, is it impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true?\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true: \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow.\" If this premise is true, then it means that whenever the apple is red, the banana must be yellow.\n\nNow, let's consider the second premise: \"The banana was not yellow.\" This premise states that the banana did not have the property of being yellow.\n\nGiven these two premises, we can conclude that the apple cannot be red because if it were, the banana would have to be yellow, which contradicts our second premise. Therefore, the conclusion \"The apple was not red\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
