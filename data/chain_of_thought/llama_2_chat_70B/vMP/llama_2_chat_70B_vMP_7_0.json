This means that if the condition \"Alex finished the race\" is true, then the conclusion \"Chris finished the race\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Alex finished the race. This means that the condition in the first premise is satisfied, and therefore the conclusion should logically follow.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that Chris finished the race. Since the first premise states that if Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race, and the second premise states that Alex did finish the race, it logically follows that Chris finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
