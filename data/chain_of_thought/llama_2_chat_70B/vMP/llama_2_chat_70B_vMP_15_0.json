The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that it has the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"Sam took a plane\" and B is \"Erin took a train.\"\n3. The second premise is a simple statement, asserting that Sam took a plane.\n4. The conclusion is a conditional statement, asserting that Erin took a train.\n5. Since the argument follows the modus ponens structure and the first premise is a conditional statement, it is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
