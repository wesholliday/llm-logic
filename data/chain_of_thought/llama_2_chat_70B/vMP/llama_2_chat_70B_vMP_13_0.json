This means that if the car's color is red, then the truck's color is necessarily blue.\n2. The second premise states that the car was red. This means that the car's color is indeed red.\n3. Based on the first premise and the second premise, we can logically conclude that the truck's color is blue.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows a logical pattern of reasoning. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
