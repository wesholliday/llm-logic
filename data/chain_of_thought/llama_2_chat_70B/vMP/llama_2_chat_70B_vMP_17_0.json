This means that if the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then the conclusion \"Kate ate salad\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Ben ate pasta. This means that the condition in the first premise is satisfied, and therefore the conclusion should follow logically.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that Kate ate salad. Based on the first premise and second premise, this conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
