This means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Lisa bought the red shirt. This means that the first premise is satisfied, and therefore the conclusion must be true.\n3. The conclusion states that Mark bought the blue shirt. Since the premises are true, this conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
