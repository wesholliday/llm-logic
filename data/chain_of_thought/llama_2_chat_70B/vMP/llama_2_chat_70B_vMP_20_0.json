This means that if the apple had a certain property (being red), then the banana must have a different property (being yellow).\n2. The second premise states that the apple was red. This means that the apple has the property of being red.\n3. The conclusion states that the banana was yellow. This means that the banana has the property of being yellow.\n4. Based on the first premise, if the apple has the property of being red, then the banana must have the property of being yellow.\n5. Since the apple does have the property of being red (according to the second premise), it follows that the banana must have the property of being yellow (according to the first premise).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because if the premises are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
