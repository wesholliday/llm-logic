            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. This means that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n2. The second premise states that the griffin was indeed in the forest. This means that the condition stated in the first premise, namely the presence of the griffin in the forest, is satisfied.\n3. Therefore, based on the first premise and the second premise, we can logically conclude that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
