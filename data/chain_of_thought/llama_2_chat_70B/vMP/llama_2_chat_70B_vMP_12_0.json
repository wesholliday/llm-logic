This means that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Joe did go to the park. This means that the condition in the first premise has been satisfied, and therefore the conclusion should logically follow.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that Lucy went to the zoo. Based on the first two premises, this conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
