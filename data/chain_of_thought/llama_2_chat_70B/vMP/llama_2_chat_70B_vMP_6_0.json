This means that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Sue chose pizza. This means that the condition in the first premise is satisfied, and therefore the conclusion should follow logically.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is \"Bob chose pasta\". Based on the first two premises, this conclusion logically follows.\n\nTherefore, the form of the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
