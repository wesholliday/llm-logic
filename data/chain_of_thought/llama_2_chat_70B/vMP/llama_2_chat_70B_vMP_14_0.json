This means that if we know the bear was in the cave, we can conclude that the wolf was in the den.\n2. The second premise states that the bear was in the cave. This means that we have established that the bear was in the cave.\n3. Based on the first premise and the second premise, we can logically conclude that the wolf was in the den.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
