This means that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n2. The second premise states that the doll was plastic. Therefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that the truck was metal.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is indeed 'The truck was metal', which follows logically from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the form of this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
