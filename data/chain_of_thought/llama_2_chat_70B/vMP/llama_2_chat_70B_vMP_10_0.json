This means that if the dog was inside, the cat must be outside.\n2. The second premise states that the dog was inside. This means that the condition in the first premise (the dog being inside) is met.\n3. Therefore, based on the first premise and second premise, we can logically conclude that the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
