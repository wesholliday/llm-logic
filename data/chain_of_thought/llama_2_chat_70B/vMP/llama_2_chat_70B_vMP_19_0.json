            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, with the first premise being \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\" This means that if the antecedent (Tom watching football) is true, then the consequent (Jen watching basketball) must also be true.\n2. The second premise is \"Tom watched football,\" which means that the antecedent of the first premise is true.\n3. Therefore, based on the logic of the conditional statement, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true. In this case, since Tom did watch football, it follows that Jen must have watched basketball.\n4. The conclusion of the argument is \"Jen watched basketball,\" which logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
