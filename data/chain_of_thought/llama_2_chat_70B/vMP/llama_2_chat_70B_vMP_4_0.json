This means that the visit to Mars by the alien is sufficient to conclude that the robot visited Jupiter.\n2. The second premise states that the alien visited Mars. This means that the condition stated in the first premise has been met.\n3. Therefore, based on the first premise and second premise, it logically follows that the robot visited Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
