This means that the vampire's being awake is sufficient to conclude that the mummy was also awake.\n2. The second premise states that the vampire was awake. This means that the condition stated in the first premise has been met.\n3. Therefore, based on the first premise and the second premise, we can logically conclude that the mummy was awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
