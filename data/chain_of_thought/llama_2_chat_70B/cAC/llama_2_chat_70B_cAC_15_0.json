Therefore, Sam took a plane (conclusion)\n\nI have used modus ponens, a logical rule that allows me to conclude that the antecedent of a conditional statement is true if the consequent is true. In this case, the antecedent is \"Sam took a plane\" and the consequent is \"Erin took a train\". Since we know that Erin took a train, we can conclude that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
