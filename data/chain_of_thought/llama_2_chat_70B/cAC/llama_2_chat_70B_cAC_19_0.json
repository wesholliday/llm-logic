Modus Ponens states that if \"If A, then B\" and \"B,\" then we can conclude \"A.\"\n\nStep 3: Check for any assumptions or unstated premises.\n\nThere don't appear to be any unstated premises or assumptions in this argument.\n\nStep 4: Consider counterexamples or alternative scenarios that might refute the conclusion.\n\nOne possible counterexample could be if Tom did not watch football, despite Jen watching basketball. In this case, the conclusion \"Tom watched football\" would not logically follow from the premises.\n\nStep 5: Based on the above analysis, determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nSince we found a possible counterexample in Step 4, we cannot conclude that \"Tom watched football\" logically follows from the premises. The argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
