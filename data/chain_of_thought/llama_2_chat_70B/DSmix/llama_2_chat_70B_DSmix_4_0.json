The second statement introduces a possibility that the fribble might not be in the crinked state.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions and make inferences\n\nBased on the information provided, we can conclude that if the fribble is not crinked, then it must be snurgled, since those are the only two possible states according to the first statement. Therefore, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
