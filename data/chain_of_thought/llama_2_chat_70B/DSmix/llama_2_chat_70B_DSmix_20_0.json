If the fleeg might not be surned (from the second statement), then it means that it is possible that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince we know that if the fleeg is not bluttered, then it must be surned, and it is possible that the fleeg is not surned, we can infer that the fleeg might be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
