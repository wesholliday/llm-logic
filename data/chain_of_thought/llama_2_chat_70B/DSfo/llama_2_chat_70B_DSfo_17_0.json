The premise \"Either the scarf is draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\" implies that there are only two possible locations for the scarf: the coat rack or the backpack.\n2. We know that the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, according to the first premise.\n3. Therefore, if the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, it must be in the other possible location, which is the backpack.\n4. So, we can conclude that the scarf is stuffed in your backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
