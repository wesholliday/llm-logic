The statement \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" implies that the keys are not in the cabinet.\n2. The statement \"Either the keys are dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the keys: either they are in the cabinet, or they are in the drawer.\n3. Since we know that the keys are not in the cabinet (from step 1), the only remaining option is that they are in the drawer.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
