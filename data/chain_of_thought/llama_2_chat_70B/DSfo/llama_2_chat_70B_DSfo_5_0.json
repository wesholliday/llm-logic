The statement \"The cookies aren't hidden in the pantry\" implies that the cookies are not located in the pantry.\n2. The statement \"Either the cookies are hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the cookies - either they are in the pantry (hidden or not) or they are in the jar.\n3. Since we know that the cookies are not located in the pantry (from step 1), we can conclude that they must be in the jar, as it's the only remaining option.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
