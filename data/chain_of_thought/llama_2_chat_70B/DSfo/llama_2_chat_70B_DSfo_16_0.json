The statement \"The pen isn't on my desk\" means that the pen is not located on the speaker's desk.\n2. The statement \"Either the pen is on my desk or it is in my bag\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the pen: either it's on the desk or it's in the bag.\n3. Since we know that the pen isn't on the desk (from step 1), we can conclude that the pen must be in the bag, as it's the only remaining option.\n\nTherefore, the statement \"The pen is in my bag\" can be inferred from the given premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
