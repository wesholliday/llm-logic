Therefore, the second statement becomes:\nEither the watch is charging on the dresser or it is not on his wrist.\n\nStep 3: Conclude based on the modified statement\n\nSince the watch isn't on his wrist and the only other option is that it is charging on the dresser, we can conclude that the watch is indeed charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
