The statement \"Either the newspaper is sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway\" implies that the newspaper cannot be in any other location besides the porch or the driveway.\n2. We know that the newspaper isn't sitting on the porch, so we can eliminate that option.\n3. Since the newspaper cannot be in any other location besides the porch or the driveway, and it's not on the porch, it must be in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
