The statement \"The sunglasses aren't perched on her head\" means that the sunglasses are not located on her head.\n2. The statement \"Either the sunglasses are perched on her head or they are in her bag\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the sunglasses: either they are on her head or they are in her bag.\n3. Since we know that the sunglasses are not on her head (from step 1), we can conclude that they must be in her bag (from step 2).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
