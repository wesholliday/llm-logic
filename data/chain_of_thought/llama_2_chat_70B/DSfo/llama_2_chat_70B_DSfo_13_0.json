It suggests that the toy can be in one of two places: the shelf or the toy box.\n\nStep 3: Consider the first statement\n\n* The toy isn't sitting on the shelf. This means that the toy is not in the first place mentioned in the second statement (the shelf).\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\n* Since the toy is not in the first place (the shelf), it must be in the second place (the toy box). Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
