The statement \"Either the notebook is sitting on the nightstand or it is in the drawer\" implies that the notebook is either on the nightstand or in the drawer, but not both.\n2. We know that the notebook isn't sitting on the nightstand, so the only remaining possibility is that it is in the drawer.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
