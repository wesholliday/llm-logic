If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nStep 2: Assess the relationship between the two premises.\nIn this case, we have a conditional statement (If-Then) followed by a negation (not). The conditional statement implies that if the bear is in the cave, then the wolf must be in the den. The negation states that the wolf was not in the den.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion that can be drawn from the premises.\nGiven the relationship between the premises, we can infer that if the wolf was not in the den, then the bear must not have been in the cave. This is a logical contrapositive of the original conditional statement.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\nAnswer: Yes.",
