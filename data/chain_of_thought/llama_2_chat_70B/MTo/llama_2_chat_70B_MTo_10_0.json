Specifically, if the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to draw a conclusion based on the information.\n\n* Since we know that the cat was not outside, we can infer that the dog must have been inside. This is because if the dog were outside, then the cat would have to be outside as well, which contradicts our given information. Therefore, the only possible location for the dog is inside, and we can conclude that the dog was indeed inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
