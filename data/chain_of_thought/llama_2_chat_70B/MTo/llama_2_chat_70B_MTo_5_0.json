            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"Amy did not play tennis\" - This means that Amy did not engage in the activity of playing tennis.\n* \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" - This is a conditional statement that implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis. It means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\nLet's assume that Jeff did play basketball. If that's the case, then according to the conditional statement, Amy must have played tennis. However, we know that Amy did not play tennis, which means that the assumption that Jeff played basketball leads to a contradiction.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball. If he had played basketball, then Amy would have played tennis, but she didn't. Therefore, the statement \"Jeff did not play basketball\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
