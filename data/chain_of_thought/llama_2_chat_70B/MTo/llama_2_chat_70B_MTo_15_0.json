To determine if this conclusion logically follows from the given information, we need to evaluate the premises and their relationships.\n\nStep 3: Apply logical reasoning\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that Erin did not take a train. The second premise states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train. This means that if Sam did take a plane, Erin would have taken a train. Since Erin did not take a train, it implies that the condition in the second premise (Sam taking a plane) did not occur. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nStep 4: Confirm the conclusion\n\nBased on the logical reasoning above, we can confirm that the conclusion \"Sam did not take a plane\" logically follows from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
