This means that the truck could have had any other color except blue.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if the car was red, then the truck would have been blue. This means that if the car had the color red, then the truck would have had the color blue, but since the truck was not blue, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
