If that's the case, then according to the second statement, Kate must have eaten the salad. However, we know that Kate did not eat the salad, which means that our assumption that Ben ate pasta must be false.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
