If that's the case, then according to the second statement, Lucy must have gone to the zoo. However, we know that Lucy did not go to the zoo, which means that our assumption that Joe went to the park must be false.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
