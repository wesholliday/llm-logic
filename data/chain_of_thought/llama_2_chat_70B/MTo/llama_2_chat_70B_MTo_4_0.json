This contradicts the first premise that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\t+ Therefore, this scenario leads to a logical contradiction, and we can conclude that the alien did not visit Mars.\n* Scenario 2: The alien did not visit Mars\n\t+ If the alien did not visit Mars, then the condition in the second premise is not met, and the conclusion that the robot visited Jupiter does not follow.\n\t+ In this scenario, the first premise still holds, as the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the alien did not visit Mars.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
