In this case, the statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 3: Consider the negation of the conclusion\n\nTo determine whether we can infer \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt,\" we need to consider the negation of the conclusion. In other words, we need to ask ourselves what would happen if Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 4: Apply modus tollens\n\nIf Lisa bought the red shirt, then according to the second statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. However, we know that Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that the hypothesis \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" leads to a logical contradiction, which implies that it is false.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
