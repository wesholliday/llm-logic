In this case, the hypothesis is \"the shirt was cotton,\" and the consequence is \"the pants were denim.\"\n\nStep 3: Consider the negation of the conclusion.\nIf we want to infer \"The shirt was not cotton,\" we need to negate the conclusion of the second statement. In other words, we need to assume that the pants were not denim (which is given in the first statement).\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the argument.\nGiven the negation of the conclusion, we can now evaluate the argument:\n\n* The pants were not denim (given).\n* If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim (hypothesis).\n* The pants were not denim (negation of the conclusion).\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the evaluation, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
