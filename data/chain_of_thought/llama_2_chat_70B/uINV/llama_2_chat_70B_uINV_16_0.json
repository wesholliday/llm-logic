So, the negated statement would be \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the negated statement\nThe negated statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the shirt being cotton implies that the pants are denim, then the shirt not being cotton implies that the pants are not denim.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
