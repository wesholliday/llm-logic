In this case, the hypothesis is \"the cake was not chocolate\" and the conclusion is \"the muffins were not blueberry.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nTo determine if we can infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry, we need to evaluate the contrapositive statement.\n\nIf the cake was not chocolate, then it is possible that the muffins were still blueberry, as there is no direct relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffin. In other words, the fact that the cake was not chocolate does not necessarily mean that the muffins were not blueberry.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry. The absence of a direct relationship between the type of cake and the type of muffin means that we cannot make any conclusions about the muffins based solely on the type of cake.\n\nAnswer: No",
