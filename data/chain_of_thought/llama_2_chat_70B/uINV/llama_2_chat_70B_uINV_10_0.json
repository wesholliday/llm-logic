In this case, the inverse statement does follow logically because if the dog is not inside, then it must be outside, and if the dog is outside, then the cat must be inside (based on the original statement).\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.",
