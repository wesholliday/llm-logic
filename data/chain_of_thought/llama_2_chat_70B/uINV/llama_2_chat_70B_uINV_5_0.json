Amy played tennis.\n2. Amy did not play tennis.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate each case:\n\n1. If Amy played tennis, then the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is still true, which means that the negated hypothesis \"Jeff did not play basketball\" leads to a contradiction.\n2. If Amy did not play tennis, then the statement \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" is false, which means that the negated hypothesis \"Jeff did not play basketball\" does not lead to a contradiction.\n\nStep 5: Based on the evaluation in step 4, determine whether the conclusion follows logically:\n\nSince the negated hypothesis leads to a contradiction in one of the cases, we can infer that if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
