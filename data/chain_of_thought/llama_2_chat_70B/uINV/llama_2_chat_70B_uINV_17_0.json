            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad.\" This means that if Ben consumed pasta, it follows that Kate consumed salad.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the contrapositive\nTo determine if we can infer the negation of the consequent (Kate did not eat salad) from the negation of the antecedent (Ben did not eat pasta), we need to create the contrapositive statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" is:\n\n\"If Kate did not eat salad, then Ben did not eat pasta.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the contrapositive\nNow we need to determine if the contrapositive statement is true.\n\nIf Kate did not eat salad, it does not necessarily mean that Ben did not eat pasta. There is no direct relationship between Kate's food choices and Ben's food choices. Ben could still have eaten pasta even if Kate did not eat salad.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the evaluation of the contrapositive, we cannot infer that if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. The statement \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\" is not necessarily true.\n\nAnswer: No",
