            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the premise\nThe premise is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter.\" This means that if the alien went to Mars, it necessarily follows that the robot went to Jupiter.\n\nStep 2: Negate the premise\nTo negate the premise, we need to reverse the order of the clauses. So, the negated premise would be \"If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion\nThe conclusion we want to draw is \"If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter.\" This is the contrapositive of the negated premise.\n\nStep 4: Check for logical equivalence\nWe can use a truth table to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise. Here's a simplified truth table:\n\n| Premise | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| T | T |\n| F | F |\n\nAs we can see, the conclusion logically follows from the premise. Therefore, if the alien did not visit Mars, then we can infer that the robot did not visit Jupiter.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
