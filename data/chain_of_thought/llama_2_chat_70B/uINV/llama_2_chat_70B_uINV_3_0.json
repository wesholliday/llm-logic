In other words, if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion cannot be true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the argument\nSince the given information is a conditional statement, we can use modus tollens to evaluate the argument. Modus tollens states that if \"If A, then B\" is true, and not-A is true, then not-B must be true. In this case, A is \"the book was written by James,\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel.\"\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that if the book was not written by James (not-A), then it cannot be a mystery novel (not-B). Therefore, the conclusion \"the book is not a mystery novel\" logically follows from the hypothesis \"the book was not written by James.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
