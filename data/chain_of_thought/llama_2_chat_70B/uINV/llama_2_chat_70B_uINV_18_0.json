Therefore, the negated conclusion \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal\" is false.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the original conclusion follows logically from the premises\nSince the negated conclusion is false, we can conclude that the original conclusion \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
