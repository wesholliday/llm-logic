Modus ponens states that if \"If A, then B\" is true, and A is true, then B must be true. In this case, A is \"Mary was at the wedding,\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the conclusion\nSince we know that Mary was not at the wedding (hypothetical situation), we can deduce that Sue was not at the wedding either. This conclusion follows logically from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
