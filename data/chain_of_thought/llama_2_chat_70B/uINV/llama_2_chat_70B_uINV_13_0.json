            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is a conditional statement of the form \"If A, then B.\" In this case, A is \"the car was red\" and B is \"the truck was blue.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the contrapositive statement would be \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the truth of the contrapositive statement\nTo determine if we can infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue, we need to evaluate the truth of the contrapositive statement.\n\nIf the truck was not blue, then the hypothesis of the original statement is false, which means that the conclusion (the car was red) is also false. Therefore, the contrapositive statement \"If the truck was not blue, then the car was not red\" is true.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the truth of the contrapositive statement, we can infer that if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
