If Tom does not watch football, it does not necessarily mean that Jen did not watch basketball. There could be other factors influencing Jen's decision to watch basketball. Therefore, the negated premise does not logically follow from the original premise.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question:\n\nAnswer: No",
