If Sam did not take a plane, then the statement \"Erin took a train\" is still true. This is because the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" does not imply that Sam taking a plane is a necessary condition for Erin to take a train. It only states that if Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. This is because the statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" does not provide any information about the possibility of Erin taking a train if Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: No",
