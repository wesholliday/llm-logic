In this case, the contrapositive statement would be \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the truth of the contrapositive statement\nIn this case, the contrapositive statement is \"If not yellow, then not red.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, meaning that if the banana is not yellow, then the apple is not red.\n\nStep 4: Infer the conclusion\nBased on the contrapositive statement, we can infer that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
