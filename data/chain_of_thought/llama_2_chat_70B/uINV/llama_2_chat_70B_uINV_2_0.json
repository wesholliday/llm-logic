So, the negated premise would be \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the negated premise\nThe negated premise is logically equivalent to \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\" This means that if we know the griffin was not in the forest, we can conclude that the unicorn was also not in the forest.\n\nStep 4: Answer\nAnswer: Yes.",
