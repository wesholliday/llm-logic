In this case, the premise is \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" which means that if the premise is false, then the conclusion must also be false.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that if Joe did not go to the park, then Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
