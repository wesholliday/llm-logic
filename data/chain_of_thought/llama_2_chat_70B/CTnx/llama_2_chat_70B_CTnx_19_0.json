In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk did not plagged\" would be \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\".\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the contrapositive implies the desired inference\n\nThe desired inference is \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\". This inference is equivalent to the contrapositive of the given statement. Therefore, we can infer \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
