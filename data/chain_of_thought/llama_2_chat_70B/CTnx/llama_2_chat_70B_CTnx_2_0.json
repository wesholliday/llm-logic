In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint\" would be \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nStep 3: Check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement\n\nThe contrapositive we obtained in step 2 is \"If the wug did not bim the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement because if the wug did not bim the zoint, then it must have been flooped.\n\nStep 4: Infer the desired conclusion\n\nNow that we know that the contrapositive of the given statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can infer the desired conclusion, which is \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was not flooped.\" This follows logically from the contrapositive because if the wug did bim the zoint, then it must have been flooped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
