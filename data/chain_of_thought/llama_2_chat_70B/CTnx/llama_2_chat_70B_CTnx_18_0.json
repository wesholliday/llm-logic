In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" would be \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was plooked.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the statement\n\nNegating the statement gives us \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was nugged.\"\n\nStep 4: Check if the negated statement is equivalent to the original statement\n\nThe negated statement \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was nugged\" is not equivalent to the original statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\" The two statements have different hypotheses and conclusions.\n\nStep 5: Determine if the negated statement implies the contrapositive\n\nThe negated statement \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was nugged\" does not imply the contrapositive \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was plooked.\" The two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nStep 6: Answer the question\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" from the given statement \"If the shank was plooked, then the shank was not nugged.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
