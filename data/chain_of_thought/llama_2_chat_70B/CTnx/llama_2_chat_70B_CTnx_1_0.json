In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was blimmed.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the statement\nNegating the statement gives us \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nStep 4: Check if the negated statement is equivalent to the original statement\nThe negated statement is not equivalent to the original statement. The original statement asserts that blimming implies non-zargling, while the negated statement asserts that non-blimming implies zargling. These are not the same thing.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
