In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was not garpled\" would be \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was sproinged.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the statement\n\nNegating the statement gives us \"If the wug was garpled, then it was not sproinged.\"\n\nStep 4: Check if the negated statement is true\n\nSince we have already identified the contrapositive of the original statement, we can use it to check if the negated statement is true. The contrapositive is \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was sproinged,\" which implies that if the wug was garpled, it was not sproinged.\n\nTherefore, the negated statement \"If the wug was garpled, then it was not sproinged\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
