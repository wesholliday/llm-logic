            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the statement\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion and negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" would be \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was vroombed.\"\n\nStep 3: Check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement\nThe contrapositive we obtained in step 2 is \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was vroombed.\" This is logically equivalent to the original statement because if the dreb was not spened, then it must have been vroombed, and vice versa.\n\nStep 4: Infer the conclusion\nBased on the logical equivalence of the contrapositive and the original statement, we can infer that \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was not vroombed\" is a logically valid conclusion.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
