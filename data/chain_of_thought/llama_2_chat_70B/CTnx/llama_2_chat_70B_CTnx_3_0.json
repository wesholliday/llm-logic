This is because the original statement \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat did not quank\" implies that if the splat was morphed, then it cannot quack. Therefore, if the splat does quack, it must mean that it was not morphed.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that \"If the splat quank, then the splat was not morphed\" is a logically valid statement. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
