            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished.\"\n\nThis statement is in the form of a conditional tautology, which means that the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the premise is \"the twonk was plinked,\" and the conclusion is \"it was not varnished.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, while keeping the logical relationship between them intact. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was not varnished\" would be \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was plinked.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the contrapositive implies the desired inference.\n\nThe desired inference is \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\" This inference is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the given statement, which we derived in step 2. Therefore, we can infer \"If the twonk was varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
