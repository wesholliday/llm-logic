In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug did not snugged\" would be \"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\".\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the contrapositive implies the desired inference\n\nThe desired inference is \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\". This inference is equivalent to the contrapositive of the given statement. Therefore, we can infer \"If the clug snugged, then the clug was not fleeked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
