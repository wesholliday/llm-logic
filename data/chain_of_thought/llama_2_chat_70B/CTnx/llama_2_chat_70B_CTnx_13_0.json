In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" would be \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was slogged\".\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the contrapositive implies the desired inference\n\nThe desired inference is \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged\". This inference is equivalent to the contrapositive of the given statement. Therefore, we can infer \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
