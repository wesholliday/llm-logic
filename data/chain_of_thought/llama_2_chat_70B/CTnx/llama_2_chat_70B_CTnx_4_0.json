In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink\" would be \"If the fribble did not crink, then the fribble was snurgled.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the hypothesis and conclusion of the contrapositive\nNegating the hypothesis and conclusion of the contrapositive gives us \"If the fribble did crink, then the fribble was not snurgled.\"\n\nStep 4: Check if this statement is logically equivalent to the original statement\nThe negated statement \"If the fribble did crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" is logically equivalent to the original statement \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble did not crink.\" Both statements convey the same meaning, that snurgling and crinking are mutually exclusive.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If the fribble crink, then the fribble was not snurgled\" from the given statement.",
