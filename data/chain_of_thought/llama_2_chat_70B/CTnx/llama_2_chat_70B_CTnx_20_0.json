            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it did not surn.\"\n\nThis statement is in the form of a conditional tautology, where the antecedent is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and the consequent is \"it did not surn\". This means that if the antecedent is true, then the consequent must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the antecedent and consequent and negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the fleeg did not surn, then it was bluttered.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the contrapositive implies the desired inference.\n\nThe desired inference is \"If the fleeg surned, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\" This is equivalent to saying that if the negation of the consequent (surn) is true, then the antecedent (bluttered) must be false.\n\nStep 4: Check whether the contrapositive implies the negation of the consequent.\n\nThe contrapositive states that if the fleeg did not surn, then it was bluttered. This means that if the fleeg surned, then it was not bluttered, which is equivalent to saying that the negation of the consequent (surn) implies the antecedent (bluttered) is false.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion based on the above analysis.\n\nSince the contrapositive implies the negation of the consequent, we can infer that if the fleeg surned, then it was not bluttered. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
