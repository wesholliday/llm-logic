In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was shripped.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the contrapositive\nNegating the contrapositive gives us \"If the smip did lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n\nStep 4: Check if this statement is equivalent to the original statement\nThe negated contrapositive \"If the smip did lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\" is logically equivalent to the original statement \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip did not lup the zoint.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was not shripped\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
