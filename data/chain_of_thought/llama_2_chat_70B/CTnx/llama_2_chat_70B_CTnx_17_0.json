In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the flob did not movate, then the flob was skizzled.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the contrapositive\nNegating the contrapositive gives us \"If the flob did movate, then the flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nStep 4: Check if this statement is equivalent to the original statement\nThe negated contrapositive and the original statement are logically equivalent. This means that we can infer \"If the flob movated, then the flob was not skizzled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
