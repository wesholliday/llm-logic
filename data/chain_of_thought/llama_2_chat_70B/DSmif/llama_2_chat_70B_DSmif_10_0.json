The first premise states that the missing sock must be either under the bed or in the laundry basket. This means that there are only two possible locations for the missing sock.\n2. The second premise states that the missing sock isn't under the bed. This means that the only remaining possibility is that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n3. Therefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the missing sock is indeed in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
