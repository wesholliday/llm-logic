If the book is on the table, then the first statement (\"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\") would be true. However, the second statement (\"The book might not be resting on the table\") would suggest that this possibility is uncertain.\n* Consider the possibility that the book is on the shelf. If the book is on the shelf, then both statements would be true. The first statement (\"Either the book must be resting on the table or it is on the shelf\") would be true because the book is on the shelf, and the second statement (\"The book might not be resting on the table\") would be true because the book is not on the table.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the book is on the shelf. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the first statement suggests the book must be in one of two places, and the second statement indicates that it might not be on the table. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
