The statement \"Either the keys must be dangling in the cabinet or they are in the drawer\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the keys.\n2. The phrase \"The keys aren't dangling in the cabinet\" rules out one of those options, leaving only the second option: \"they are in the drawer.\"\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the keys are in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
