However, we don't know whether the alien actually visited Mars.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nWe cannot infer \"The alien did not visit Mars\" based on the given information. The second statement provides a conditional relationship between the alien's visit to Mars and the robot's visit to Jupiter, but we don't have enough information to determine whether the condition is true or false. Therefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
