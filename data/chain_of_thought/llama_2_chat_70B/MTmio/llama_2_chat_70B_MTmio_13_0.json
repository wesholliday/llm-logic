From the second statement, we know that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. However, we don't know the actual color of the car or the truck.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\n\nWe can infer that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue, based on the second statement. However, we cannot infer the color of the car or the truck from the given information. We also cannot infer that the car was not red because the first statement only suggests that the truck might not have been blue, and it doesn't provide any information about the car's color.\n\nStep 4: Answer\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the car was not red from the given information.",
