            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statements\n\n* \"The banana might not have been yellow\" means that the banana could have been any color other than yellow, including green, blue, red, etc.\n* \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" means that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow, and not any other color.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement is a conditional statement, where the premise is \"the apple was red\" and the conclusion is \"the banana must have been yellow\". The first statement is a statement of possibility, indicating that the banana could have been any color other than yellow.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer 'The apple was not red'\n\nIf we assume that the banana might not have been yellow, then the conditional statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow\" does not provide enough information to conclude that the apple was not red. This is because, even if the banana might not have been yellow, it's still possible for the apple to be red.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer 'The apple was not red' from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: No",
