If that's the case, then according to the second statement, the wolf must have been in the den.\n\nStep 3: Now, let's consider the first statement again. It says that the wolf might not have been in the den. This means that there's a possibility that the wolf was not in the den, even if the bear was in the cave.\n\nStep 4: If the wolf was not in the den, and the bear was in the cave, then we can infer that the bear was not in the den.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
