From the second statement, we know that if the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. This means that if the shirt was not cotton, then the pants could still be denim or some other material.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to draw a conclusion based on the information provided.\n\nSince we know that the pants might not have been denim and the shirt was not cotton, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton. Therefore, the statement \"The shirt was not cotton\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
