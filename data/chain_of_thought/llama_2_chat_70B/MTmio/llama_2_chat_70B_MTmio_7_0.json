He might have finished the race, or he might not have finished it.\n\nBased on the second statement, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished it too. This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris might still have finished it.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nWe want to infer whether Alex did not finish the race. Based on the information provided, we can see that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris might still have finished it (since Chris's status is uncertain). This means that we cannot conclusively say that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
