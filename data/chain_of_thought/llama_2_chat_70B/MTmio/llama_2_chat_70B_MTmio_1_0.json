However, based on the second statement, we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there too.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince we cannot say for certain whether Sue was at the wedding, and we know that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there too, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding. If Mary had been at the wedding, then Sue would have been there as well, but since Sue's presence is uncertain, it means that Mary cannot have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
