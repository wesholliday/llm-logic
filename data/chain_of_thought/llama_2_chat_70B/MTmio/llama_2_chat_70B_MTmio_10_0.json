From the second statement, we know that if the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside. However, we don't know the location of the dog.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\n\nWe can conclude that if the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside. But we don't know whether the dog was inside or not. Therefore, we cannot infer whether the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: No",
