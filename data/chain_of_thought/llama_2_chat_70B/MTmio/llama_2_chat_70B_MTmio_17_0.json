If that's the case, then according to the second statement, Kate must have eaten salad. But we know that Kate might not have eaten salad, so we have a contradiction. This means that our assumption that Ben ate pasta must be false, and therefore Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
