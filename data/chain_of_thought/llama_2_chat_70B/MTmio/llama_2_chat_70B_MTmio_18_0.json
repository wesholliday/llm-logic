            "content": "\nStep 1: Write down the given information in a clear and concise way.\n\n* The truck might not have been metal.\n* If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information and identify any patterns or relationships between the statements.\n\n* The first statement suggests that the truck may not have been made of metal, but it doesn't provide any information about the doll.\n* The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between the doll and the truck. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible scenarios that could satisfy both statements.\n\n* Scenario 1: The doll was not plastic, and the truck was not metal. This scenario satisfies both statements, as the doll is not plastic, and the truck is not metal.\n* Scenario 2: The doll was plastic, and the truck was metal. This scenario also satisfies both statements, as the doll is plastic, and the truck is metal.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the possibilities and determine which one is more likely or relevant to the problem at hand.\n\n* Since we have two possible scenarios, we need to consider which one is more likely or relevant. In this case, scenario 1 is more relevant because it does not require the doll to be plastic, which is consistent with the first statement.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion based on your analysis and answer the question.\n\n* Answer: Yes, we can infer that the doll was not plastic. This inference is based on the fact that if the doll were plastic, then the truck would have to be metal, which contradicts the first statement. Therefore, the only possible scenario consistent with both statements is that the doll was not plastic.",
