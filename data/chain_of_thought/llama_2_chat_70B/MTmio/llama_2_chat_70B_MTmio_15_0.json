            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"Erin might not have taken a train\" means that Erin's mode of transportation is not certain, and it's possible that she didn't take a train.\n* \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train\" means that if Sam took a plane, then Erin's mode of transportation is determined to be a train.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\nLet's assume that Sam did take a plane. If that's the case, then according to the second statement, Erin must have taken a train. However, we know that Erin might not have taken a train, which means that this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane. If Sam had taken a plane, it would have implied that Erin took a train, but since Erin might not have taken a train, it's impossible for Sam to have taken a plane.\n\nAnswer: No",
