The second statement implies that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nIf we combine the two statements, we can infer that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob did not choose pasta. This is because if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta according to the second statement, but this contradicts the first statement which states that Bob might not have chosen pasta. Therefore, the only possibility is that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
