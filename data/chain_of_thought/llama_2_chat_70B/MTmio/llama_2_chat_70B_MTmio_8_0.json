However, based on the second statement, if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake. This means that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy might not have been awake either.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that if the vampire was not awake, then the mummy might not have been awake either. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
