In this case, the premise of the second statement is false, so the conclusion (Jen watching basketball) does not necessarily follow. This means that we cannot infer anything about Tom's actions based on the given information.\n* Scenario 2: Tom watched football. In this case, the premise of the second statement is true, which means that Jen must have watched basketball. However, this scenario is incompatible with the first statement, which suggests that Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\n* Since we cannot infer anything about Tom's actions based on the given information, and since the second statement implies that Jen must have watched basketball if Tom watched football, we can conclude that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
