            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" means that Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is uncertain.\n* \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" means that if Lisa purchased the red shirt, then Mark's purchase of the blue shirt becomes necessary.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nThe second statement implies that Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is dependent on Lisa's purchase of the red shirt. If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is not necessary, and it becomes uncertain again.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nSince Mark's purchase of the blue shirt is uncertain, and it is dependent on Lisa's purchase of the red shirt, we can infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
