In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the statement\nNegating the statement gives us \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\nStep 4: Determine if the negated statement is equivalent to the original statement\nThe negated statement is not equivalent to the original statement. The original statement asserts that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled, while the negated statement asserts that if the zinger was not fraggled, then it was not smoogled. These two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nStep 5: Determine if the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement\nThe contrapositive of the statement is \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, as both assert that the zinger's state (fraggled or smoogled) is linked to its opposite state.\n\nStep 6: Answer the question\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"If the zinger was smoogled, then the zinger was fraggled\" from the given statement. The contrapositive of the statement is equivalent to the original statement, but the negated statement is not. Therefore, the statement is not logically implied by the given statement.",
