In this case, they are not logically equivalent because the original statement implies that blimming implies zargling, while the inverted statement implies that zargling implies blimming.\n\nStep 5: Determine the answer\nSince the statements are not logically equivalent, we cannot infer \"If the flugel was zargled, then the flugel was blimmed\" from \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
