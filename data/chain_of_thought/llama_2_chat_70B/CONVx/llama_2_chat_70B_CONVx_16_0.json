However, we cannot conclude with certainty that the sneg was crampled because there could be other reasons why the sneg sproted the frink.\n\nStep 5: Determine if the inverted statement is logically equivalent to the original statement\nThe inverted statement \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled\" is not logically equivalent to the original statement \"If the sneg was crampled, then the sneg sproted the frink.\" The original statement implies a causal relationship between the sneg being crampled and the sneg sproting the frink, while the inverted statement does not necessarily imply a causal relationship.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the sneg sproted the frink, then the sneg was crampled\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
