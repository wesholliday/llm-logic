In other words, if the condition is true, then the consequence must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Determine the inverse of the statement\nTo determine the inverse of the statement, we need to switch the condition and consequence. The inverse of \"If the smip was shripped, then the smip lupped the zoint\" would be \"If the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped.\"\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the inverse\nThe inverse statement is also a conditional tautology, which means that it is logically sound. If the consequence (the smip lupped the zoint) is true, then the condition (the smip was shripped) must also be true.\n\nStep 6: Answer the question\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that if the smip lupped the zoint, then the smip was shripped. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
