In this case, the negated statement and its contrapositive are not equivalent because they have different truth values. The negated statement \"If the shank was not plooked, then the shank was not nugged\" is true only if the shank was not plooked, whereas the contrapositive \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked\" is true regardless of whether the shank was plooked or not.\n\nStep 5: Infer the conclusion\nSince the negated statement and its contrapositive are not equivalent, we cannot infer \"If the shank was nugged, then the shank was plooked\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
