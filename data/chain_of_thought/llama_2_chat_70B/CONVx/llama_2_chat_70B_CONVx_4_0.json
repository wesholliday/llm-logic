In this case, if the fribble was indeed snurgled, it makes sense that it would crinkle.\n\nStep 4: Determine the inverse\nTo determine the inverse, we need to switch the hypothesis and conclusion.\nHypothesis: The fribble crinked\nConclusion: The fribble was snurgled\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the inverse\nThe inverse is also a conditional statement, and it makes sense that if the fribble crinked, then it must have been snurgled.\n\nStep 6: Answer the question\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If the fribble crinked, then the fribble was snurgled\" from the given statement.",
