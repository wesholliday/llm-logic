In this case, if the smonk was indeed vreebled, it makes sense that it would plaggle.\n\nStep 4: Determine the inverse\nTo determine the inverse, we need to switch the hypothesis and conclusion.\nHypothesis: The smonk plagged\nConclusion: The smonk was vreebled\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the inverse\nThe inverse is also a conditional statement, and it makes sense that if the smonk plagged, then it must have been vreebled.\n\nStep 6: Answer the question\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled\" from the given statement.",
