            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the wug was flooped, then the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the parts of the statement\nThe statement contains two parts:\n\n1. \"If the wug was flooped\" - This is the if-clause or the premise.\n2. \"then the wug bimmed the zoint\" - This is the then-clause or the conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Invert the if-clause\nTo invert the if-clause, we need to change the order of the words and negate the verb. So, \"If the wug was flooped\" becomes \"If the wug was not flooped.\"\n\nStep 4: Negate the conclusion\nNegating the conclusion means changing \"bimmed\" to its opposite, which is \"did not bim.\"\n\nStep 5: Form the inverted statement\nNow, we have the inverted statement: \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nStep 6: Check for logical equivalence\nWe need to check if the inverted statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, we need to check if the two statements have the same meaning.\n\nThe original statement says that whenever the wug is flooped, it bims the zoint. The inverted statement says that whenever the wug is not flooped, it does not bim the zoint. These two statements have the same meaning, as one implies the other.\n\nStep 7: Answer the question\nCan we infer \"If the wug bimmed the zoint, then the wug was flooped\"?\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
