The statement \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" does not necessarily mean that \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged.\"\n\nStep 5: Determine the answer\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the glip was tragged, then the glip was slogged\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
