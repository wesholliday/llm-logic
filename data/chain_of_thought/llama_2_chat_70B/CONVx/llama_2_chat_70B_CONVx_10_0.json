So, \"If the wug was sproinged\" becomes \"If the wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nStep 4: Negate the conclusion\nNegating the conclusion means changing \"then it was garpled\" to \"then it was not garpled.\"\n\nStep 5: Combine the inverted if-clause and negated conclusion\nCombining the two parts, we get: \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\n\nStep 6: Check for logical equivalence\nWe need to check if the resulting statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, we need to ensure that the truth value of the two statements is the same.\n\nThe original statement \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" implies that whenever the wug is sproinged, it is garpled. The inverted statement \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled\" implies that whenever the wug is not sproinged, it is not garpled.\n\nSince both statements convey the same meaning and have the same truth value, we can infer that \"If the wug was garpled, then it was sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
