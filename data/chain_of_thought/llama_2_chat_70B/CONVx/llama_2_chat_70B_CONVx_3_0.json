The original statement asserts that if the splat was morphed, then it quanked, while the inverted contrapositive asserts that if the splat was not morphed, then it did not quank. These two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the splat quanked, then the splat was morphed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
