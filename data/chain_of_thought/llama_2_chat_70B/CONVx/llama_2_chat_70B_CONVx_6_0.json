In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the statement\nNegating the statement gives us \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nStep 4: Convert the statement to its equivalent form\nThe statement can be rephrased as \"If the grommet was not sploffed, then the grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nStep 5: Check if the resulting statement is logically equivalent to the original statement\nThe resulting statement and the original statement are not logically equivalent. The original statement asserts that the grommet being sploffed implies that it plopped the frink, while the resulting statement asserts that the grommet not being sploffed implies that it did not plop the frink. These two statements are not logically equivalent because they do not have the same implications.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the grommet plopped the frink, then the grommet was sploffed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
