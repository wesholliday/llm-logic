The second premise states that the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, which means it's not in the second option.\n3. By process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the notebook is in the drawer.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the notebook is in the drawer logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
