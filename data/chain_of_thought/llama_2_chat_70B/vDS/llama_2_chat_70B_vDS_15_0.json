This means that if the shoes are not lined up by the door, then they must be in the closet.\n2. The second premise states that the shoes are not lined up by the door. This means that the first premise's second option (lined up by the door) is false, leaving only the first option (in the closet) as true.\n3. Based on the above reasoning, the conclusion logically follows that the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
