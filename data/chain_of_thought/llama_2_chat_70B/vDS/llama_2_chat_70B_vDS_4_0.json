The second premise states that the cat is not playing in the bedroom, which means that the cat is not in the bedroom.\n3. If the cat is not in the bedroom, then it must be in another room, such as the living room or the couch.\n4. Since the first premise states that the cat is either napping on the couch or playing in the bedroom, and we've established that it's not playing in the bedroom, then it must be napping on the couch.\n5. Therefore, the conclusion that the cat is napping on the couch logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
