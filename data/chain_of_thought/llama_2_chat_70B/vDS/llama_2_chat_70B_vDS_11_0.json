The second premise states that the newspaper is not sitting on the porch, which means it cannot be in that location.\n3. Based on the first premise and the fact that the newspaper cannot be in the porch, the only remaining option is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the newspaper is in the driveway logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
