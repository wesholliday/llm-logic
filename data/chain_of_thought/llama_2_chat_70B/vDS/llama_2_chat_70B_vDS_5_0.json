The second premise states that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, which means they cannot be in the pantry.\n3. Based on the first premise and the fact that the cookies cannot be in the pantry, the only remaining option is that the cookies are in the jar.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the cookies are in the jar logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
