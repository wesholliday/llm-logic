The second premise states that the phone isn't ringing in the kitchen, which means it's not in the kitchen.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the phone isn't in the kitchen, then it must be in the living room.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
