The second premise states that the remote control is not hiding under the couch, which means it's not in the second location.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the remote control is not in the second location, it must be in the first location, which is the coffee table.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the remote control is on the coffee table logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
