The second premise states that the jacket is not hanging in the closet.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: the jacket is indeed draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
