The second premise states that the missing sock is not under the bed.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the missing sock is not under the bed, then it must be in the laundry basket.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
