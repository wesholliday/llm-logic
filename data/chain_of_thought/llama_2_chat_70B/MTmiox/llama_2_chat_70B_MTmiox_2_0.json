However, the first statement suggests that it is possible that the wug did not bim the zoint, even if it was flooped.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the two statements, we can infer that if the wug was not flooped, then it did not bim the zoint. This is because if the wug was flooped, then it must have bimmed the zoint, according to the second statement. Therefore, if the wug was not flooped, then it did not bim the zoint.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
