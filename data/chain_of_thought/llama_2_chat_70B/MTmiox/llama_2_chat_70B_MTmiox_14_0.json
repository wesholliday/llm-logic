This means that if the clug was not fleeked, then it is possible that it was not snugged.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the clug was not fleeked. If the clug was not fleeked, then it is possible that it was not snugged. Therefore, we can conclude that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
