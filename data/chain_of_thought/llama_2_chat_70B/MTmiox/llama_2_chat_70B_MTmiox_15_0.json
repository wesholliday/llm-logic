            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"The dreb might not have been spened\" means that the dreb's state of being spened is uncertain.\n* \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb must have been spened\" means that if the dreb was in a state of being vroombed, then it must have also been in a state of being spened.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement implies that being vroombed is a sufficient condition for being spened. In other words, if the dreb was vroombed, then it must have been spened.\n\nStep 3: Use modus tollens to draw a conclusion\n\nWe can use modus tollens to deduce the negation of the conclusion from the premises. Modus tollens states that if \"If A, then B\" and \"not B,\" then \"not A.\" In this case, we have:\n\n* A: The dreb was vroombed\n* B: The dreb was spened\n* Not B: The dreb might not have been spened (given)\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can deduce:\n\n* Not A: The dreb was not vroombed\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"The dreb was not vroombed\" from the given premises.",
