The second statement provides a conditional relationship between the sprocket being cranked and being daggled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked. This is because if the sprocket was cranked, it must have been daggled, but since it was not daggled, it cannot have been cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
