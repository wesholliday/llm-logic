This means that if the flob was not skizzled, then it might not have moved.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the flob was not skizzled. If it had been skizzled, it would have moved, but since it might not have moved, it must not have been skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
