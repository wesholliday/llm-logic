However, the first statement only suggests that the fleeg might not have been surned, but does not provide any information about whether it was bluttered or not.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we cannot infer \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" from the given statements. The first statement does not provide enough information to make any conclusions about whether the fleeg was bluttered or not, and the second statement only tells us that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned, but we do not know whether it was bluttered in the first place.\n\nAnswer: No",
