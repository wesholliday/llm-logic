This means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it is certain that it was smoogled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer with certainty whether the zinger was fraggled or not. However, we can infer that if the zinger was not fraggled, then it might not have been smoogled. This is because if the zinger was not fraggled, then it is possible that it was not smoogled, as stated in the first statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
