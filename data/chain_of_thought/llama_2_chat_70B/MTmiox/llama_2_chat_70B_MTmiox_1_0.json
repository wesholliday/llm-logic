However, the first statement only suggests that the flugel might not have been zargled, but does not provide any information about whether it was blimmed or not.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the two statements, we cannot infer with certainty whether the flugel was blimmed or not. However, we can conclude that if the flugel was not zargled, then it must not have been blimmed, since the second statement implies that if it was blimmed, then it would have been zargled.\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer 'The flugel was not blimmed' from the given statements.",
