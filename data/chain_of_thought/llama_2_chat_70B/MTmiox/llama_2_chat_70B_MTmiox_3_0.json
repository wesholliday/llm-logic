This means that if the splat was not morphed, then it might not have quanked.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the splat was not morphed. If it had been morphed, then it would have quanked, but since it might not have quanked, it must not have been morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
