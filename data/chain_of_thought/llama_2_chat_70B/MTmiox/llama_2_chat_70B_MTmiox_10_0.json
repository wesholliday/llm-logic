            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"The wug might not have been garpled\" means that the state of being garpled is uncertain for the wug.\n* \"If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled\" means that if the wug was sproinged, then it necessarily follows that it was garpled.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement implies a causal relationship between being sproinged and being garpled. If the wug was sproinged, then it must have been garpled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if the wug was not garpled, then it must not have been sproinged. This is because if the wug was sproinged, then it would necessarily have been garpled, but since it was not garpled, it must not have been sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
