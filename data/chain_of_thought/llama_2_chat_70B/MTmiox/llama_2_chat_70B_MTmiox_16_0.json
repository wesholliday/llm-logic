If the sneg was crampled, then it must have sprot the frink.\n\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion\n\nIf we combine the two statements, we can infer that if the sneg was not crampled, then it might not have sprot the frink. This is because if the sneg was crampled, it would have sprot the frink, but since it might not have sprot the frink, it must not have been crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
