However, based on the second statement, if the shank was plooked, then it must have been nugged.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince we cannot say for sure whether the shank was nugged or not, and if it was plooked, then it must have been nugged, we can infer that the shank was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
