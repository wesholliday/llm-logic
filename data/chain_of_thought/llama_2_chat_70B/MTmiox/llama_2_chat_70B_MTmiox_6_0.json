To do this, we need to show that the conclusion follows logically from the given information.\n* We know that if the grommet was sploffed, it must have plopped the frink.\n* We also know that the grommet might not have plopped the frink.\n* If the grommet did not plop the frink, then it cannot be the case that it was sploffed (since we know that if it was sploffed, it must have plopped the frink).\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that \"The grommet was not sploffed\". This follows logically from the given information, since if the grommet was sploffed, it would have plopped the frink, but we know that it might not have plopped the frink.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
