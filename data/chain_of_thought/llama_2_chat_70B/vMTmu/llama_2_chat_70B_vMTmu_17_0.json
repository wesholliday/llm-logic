This means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion that Ben did not eat pasta follows logically.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad. This means that the conclusion that Ben did not eat pasta is not necessarily true.\n3. If the first premise is true and the second premise is false, then the conclusion that Ben did not eat pasta would be false.\n4. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
