            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball. This means that if the condition \"Tom watched football\" is true, then the conclusion \"Jen must have watched basketball\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that the conclusion \"Jen must have watched basketball\" from the first premise cannot be true.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is \"Tom did not watch football\". This conclusion follows logically from the first premise and the second premise. If Tom did watch football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but since it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball, it means that Tom did not watch football.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
