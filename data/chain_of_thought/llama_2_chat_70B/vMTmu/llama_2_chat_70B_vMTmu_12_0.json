            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nConclusion: Joe did not go to the park.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\n\nThis argument is a modus tollens, which is a type of deductive argument that uses the contrapositive form of a conditional statement to reach a conclusion. The basic structure of a modus tollens argument is:\n\nIf A, then B.\nNot B.\nTherefore, not A.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the premises\n\nPremise 1 is a conditional statement that asserts a causal relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. It's unclear whether this premise is true or false without additional information.\n\nPremise 2 is a negation of a modal statement, which asserts that it's not necessary that Lucy went to the zoo. This premise is equivalent to saying that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises if they are both true. If Premise 1 is true, then the contrapositive (not B) implies that Joe did not go to the park (not A). Additionally, Premise 2 asserts that Lucy did not go to the zoo, which means that the antecedent of the conditional statement in Premise 1 (Joe went to the park) cannot be true.\n\nStep 5: Determine the validity of the argument\n\nThe argument is logically valid because if both premises are true, the conclusion necessarily follows. The argument uses the contrapositive form of a conditional statement correctly, and the negation of a modal statement in Premise 2 is equivalent to an assertion of the opposite.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
