The second premise states that it's not necessary for Sue to be present at the wedding.\n3. The conclusion is that Mary was not at the wedding.\n4. If we negate the conclusion, we get \"Mary was at the wedding.\"\n5. Using modus tollens, we can deduce that if the premises are true, then the negation of the conclusion must be false.\n6. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
