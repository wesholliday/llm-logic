The formula for modus tollens is:\n\n\u00acC \u2192 \u00acP\n\nWhere C is the conclusion and P is the premise.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true: If the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. This means that if the apple was red, then it's necessary that the banana was yellow.\n\nNow let's consider the second premise: It's not the case that the banana must have been yellow. This means that it's not necessary that the banana was yellow.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that if it's not necessary that the banana was yellow, then it's not necessary that the apple was red. In other words, \u00ac(banana must have been yellow) \u2192 \u00ac(apple was red).\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes. The argument is logically valid because if the premises are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.",
