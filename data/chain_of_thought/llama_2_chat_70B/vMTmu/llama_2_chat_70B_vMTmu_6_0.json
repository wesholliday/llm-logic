            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument is as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta.\nConclusion: Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\n\nThis argument is a modus tollens, which is a type of deductive argument that uses the contrapositive form of a conditional statement to reach a conclusion. The basic structure of a modus tollens argument is:\n\nIf A, then B.\nNot B.\nTherefore, not A.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the premises\n\nPremise 1 is a conditional statement that implies a causal relationship between Sue's choice and Bob's choice. It suggests that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. Premise 2 is a negation of a modal statement, which asserts that it is not necessary that Bob chose pasta.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion\n\nThe conclusion is a negation of a proposition, which asserts that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nStep 5: Determine the validity of the argument\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion does logically follow from the premises. If Premise 1 is true and Premise 2 is false, then the conclusion must be true. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
