This means that if the cake was chocolate, then it's necessary that the muffins were blueberry.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the muffins must have been blueberry. This means that it's not necessary that the muffins were blueberry.\n3. The conclusion is that the cake was not chocolate.\n4. If the cake was not chocolate, then it's not necessary that the muffins were blueberry (since the first premise states that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry).\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
