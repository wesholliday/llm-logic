This means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion that Lisa did not buy the red shirt would also be true.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that the opposite of the first premise is true, which would mean that Lisa did buy the red shirt.\n3. The conclusion is that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, which is contradictory to the second premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically invalid because the conclusion contradicts one of the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
