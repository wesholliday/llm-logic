            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument is as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis\nPremise 2: It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis\nConclusion: Jeff did not play basketball\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\n\nThis argument is a modus tollens, which is a type of deductive argument that uses the contrapositive form of a conditional statement to reach a conclusion. The formula for modus tollens is:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\nP\n\u2234 \u00acQ\n\nWhere P is the first premise, Q is the second premise, and \u00ac represents negation.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis. This means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy playing tennis is a necessary condition.\n\nNow let's consider the second premise: It's not the case that Amy must have played tennis. This means that Amy playing tennis is not a necessary condition.\n\nIf we combine these two premises, we can see that the conclusion logically follows: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy must have played tennis (premise 1), but it's not the case that Amy must have played tennis (premise 2), therefore Jeff did not play basketball (conclusion).\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
