This means that if the bear was not in the cave, then it's possible that the wolf was not in the den.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the wolf must have been in the den. This means that it's possible that the wolf was not in the den.\n3. The conclusion is that the bear was not in the cave. This follows logically from the first two premises, as if the bear was not in the cave, then it's possible that the wolf was not in the den, and therefore the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
