            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument is as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside.\nPremise 2: It's not the case that the cat must have been outside.\nConclusion: The dog was not inside.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\n\nThis argument is a modus tollens, which is a type of deductive argument that uses the contrapositive of a conditional statement to reach a conclusion. The formula for modus tollens is:\n\n\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA\n\nWhere C is the condition and A is the antecedent. In this case, the condition is \"the cat must have been outside\" and the antecedent is \"the dog was inside\".\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nPremise 1 states that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside. This means that if the dog was inside, the condition (the cat must have been outside) is satisfied.\n\nPremise 2 states that it's not the case that the cat must have been outside. This means that the condition (the cat must have been outside) is not satisfied.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that if the condition (the cat must have been outside) is not satisfied, then the antecedent (the dog was inside) cannot be true. Therefore, the conclusion \"The dog was not inside\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
