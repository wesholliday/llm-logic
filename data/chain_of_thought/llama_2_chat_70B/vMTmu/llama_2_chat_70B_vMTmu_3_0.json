This means that if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel. This means that the book may or may not be a mystery novel, but it's not necessarily one.\n3. The conclusion states that the book was not written by James. This follows logically from the first two premises, as if the book is not a mystery novel, then it cannot have been written by James, according to the first premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
