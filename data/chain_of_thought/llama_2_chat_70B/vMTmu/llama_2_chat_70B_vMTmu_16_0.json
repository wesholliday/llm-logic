This means that if the shirt was cotton, then it's necessary that the pants were denim.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the pants must have been denim. This means that it's not necessary that the pants were denim.\n3. The conclusion is that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nBy modus tollens, we can deduce the negation of the conclusion from the premises. Modus tollens states that if \"if A then B\" and \"not B,\" then \"not A.\" In this case, A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim.\" The first premise states that if A then B, and the second premise states that not B. Therefore, we can deduce not A, which means the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
