This means that if the vampire was awake, then it's necessary that the mummy was also awake.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake. This means that it's possible that the mummy was not awake.\n3. The conclusion is that the vampire was not awake. This follows logically from the first two premises. If the vampire was awake, then the mummy must have been awake (first premise), but it's not the case that the mummy must have been awake (second premise). Therefore, it's not possible for the vampire to have been awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
