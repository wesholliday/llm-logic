This means that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" cannot be true.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that Sam did not take a plane. This is logically deduced from the first premise and second premise. If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train, but since it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train, it means that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because if the premises are true, then the conclusion necessarily follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
