This premise can be translated as \"The milk is not necessarily on the counter.\"\n3. The conclusion of the argument is \"The milk might not be on the counter.\"\n4. This conclusion can be translated as \"The milk is possibly not on the counter.\"\n5. The argument is structured as a modus tollens, with the premise being the antecedent and the conclusion being the consequent.\n6. Modus tollens is a valid logical form, where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n7. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
