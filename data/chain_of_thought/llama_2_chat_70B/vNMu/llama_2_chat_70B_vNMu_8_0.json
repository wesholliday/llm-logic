In other words, if the premise is true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nIn this case, the premise states that it's not the case that the vampire must have been awake. This means that there is no necessity for the vampire to have been awake. From this, we can conclude that it's possible for the vampire not to have been awake.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid. The conclusion follows necessarily from the premise, and therefore, the argument is sound.",
