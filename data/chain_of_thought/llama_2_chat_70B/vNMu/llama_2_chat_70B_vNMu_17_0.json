In other words, if the premise is true, does it necessarily mean that the conclusion is true?\n\nIn this case, the premise states that the scarf must not be stuffed in the backpack. If this is true, then it means that there is no requirement or necessity for the scarf to be stuffed in the backpack. This does not necessarily mean that the scarf might not be stuffed in the backpack, but it does make it a possibility. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
