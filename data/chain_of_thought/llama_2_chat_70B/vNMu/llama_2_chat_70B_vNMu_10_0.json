In other words, we need to see if it's impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premise is true.\n\nIf the premise is \"It's not the case that the dog must have been inside,\" then the negation of the antecedent is \"the dog must have been inside.\" If this negated antecedent is true, then the consequent \"the dog might not have been inside\" must also be true. In other words, if it's not necessary for the dog to have been inside, then it's possible for the dog not to have been inside.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
