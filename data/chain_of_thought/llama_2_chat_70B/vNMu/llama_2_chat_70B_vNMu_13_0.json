In other words, if the premise is true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nIf the premise \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box\" is true, it means that there is no requirement or necessity for the toy to be in the toy box. This does not necessarily mean that the toy might not be in the toy box, but it does open up the possibility that the toy might not be in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The toy might not be in the toy box\" follows logically from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
