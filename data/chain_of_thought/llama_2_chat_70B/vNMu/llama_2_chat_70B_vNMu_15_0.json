In other words, if the premise is true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nIn this case, the premise states that it's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet. This means that there is no requirement or necessity for the shoes to be in the closet. From this, we can conclude that it's possible for the shoes not to be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" logically follows from the premise, and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
