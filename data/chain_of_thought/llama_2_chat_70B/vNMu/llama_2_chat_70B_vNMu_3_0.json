This premise can be translated as \"It's possible that the book was not written by James.\"\n3. The conclusion of the argument is \"The book might not have been written by James.\"\n4. This conclusion is logically equivalent to the premise, since \"might not have been\" implies possibility.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid, as its conclusion follows necessarily from its premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
