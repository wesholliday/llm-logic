In other words, if it's true that the sunglasses must be in her bag, then it follows necessarily that the sunglasses are in her bag. However, the premise of this argument states that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag, which means that the antecedent does not imply the consequent. Therefore, this modus tollens argument is logically invalid.\n\nStep 4: Explain the reasoning\n\nThe reasoning behind this argument is flawed because it relies on a false premise. The fact that it's not the case that the sunglasses must be in her bag does not necessarily mean that the sunglasses might not be in her bag. There are other possible reasons why the sunglasses might not be in her bag, such as if she left them at home or gave them to someone else. Therefore, the conclusion of this argument is not logically supported by the premise.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: No, this form of argument is not logically valid.",
