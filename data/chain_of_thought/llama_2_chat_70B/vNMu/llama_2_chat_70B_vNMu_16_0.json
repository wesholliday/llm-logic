In other words, if the premise is true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nLet's assume that the premise is true: It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag. This means that there is no requirement or necessity for the pen to be in my bag.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: The pen might not be in my bag. This statement suggests that it's possible or conceivable that the pen is not in my bag. Given the truth of the premise, it indeed makes sense that the pen might not be in my bag, as there is no requirement for it to be there.\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument\n\nBased on our analysis, we can see that the conclusion logically follows from the premise. Since the premise is true, it's reasonable to conclude that the pen might not be in my bag. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
