In other words, could the conclusion be true if the premise is true?\n\nIf the premise is \"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt,\" then the conclusion \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" logically follows. This is because if it's not necessary that Lisa bought the red shirt, then it's possible that she didn't buy it.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
