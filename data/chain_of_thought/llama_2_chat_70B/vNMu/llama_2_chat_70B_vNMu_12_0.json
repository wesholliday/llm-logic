The conclusion of the argument is \"The jacket might not be draped over the chair.\"\n3. The argument is structured as a modus tollens, with the premise being a negation of a necessity and the conclusion being a possibility.\n4. Modus tollens is a valid logical form, as long as the premise is true, the conclusion follows necessarily.\n5. In this case, if the premise \"It's not the case that the jacket must be draped over the chair\" is true, then it means that the jacket is not necessarily draped over the chair, which implies that it might not be draped over the chair.\n6. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
