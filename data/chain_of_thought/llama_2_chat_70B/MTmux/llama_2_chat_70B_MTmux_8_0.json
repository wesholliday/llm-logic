Premise 2 denies the necessity of daggling, which means that daggling is not a certain outcome of cranking the sprocket.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis:\n\nSince premise 2 rejects the idea that daggling is a necessary consequence of cranking the sprocket, it implies that cranking the sprocket may not result in daggling. Therefore, we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
