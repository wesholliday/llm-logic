            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk must have plagged\" - This is a conditional statement, where the truth of the antecedent (\"the smonk was vreebled\") implies the truth of the consequent (\"the smonk must have plagged\").\n* \"It's not the case that the smonk must have plagged\" - This statement negates the possibility that the consequent of the conditional statement is true. In other words, it means that the smonk did not plag.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe know that if the smonk was vreebled, then it must have plagged. However, we also know that it's not the case that the smonk must have plagged. This means that the antecedent of the conditional statement (\"the smonk was vreebled\") cannot be true.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
