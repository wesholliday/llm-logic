The second statement states that the dreb was not spended.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the two statements, we can infer that the dreb was not vroombed. If the dreb was not spended, and if being vroombed implies being spended, then it logically follows that the dreb was not vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
