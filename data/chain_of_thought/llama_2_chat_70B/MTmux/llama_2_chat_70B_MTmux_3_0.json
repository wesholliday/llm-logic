The second statement, on the other hand, states that the splat does not necessarily have to quank.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the two statements, we can infer that if the splat was not morphed, then it does not have to quank. In other words, the absence of morphing implies the absence of quanking.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"The splat was not morphed\" from the given statements.",
