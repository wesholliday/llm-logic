However, the second statement indicates that zargling is not a necessary condition. This means that even if the flugel was blimmed, it's possible that it wasn't zargled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nSince zargling is not a necessary condition for blimming, and we know that the flugel was not zargled, we can infer that the flugel was not blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
