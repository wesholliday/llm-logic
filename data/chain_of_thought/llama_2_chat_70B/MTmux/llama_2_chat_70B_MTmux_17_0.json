In other words, if a flob is skizzled, then it must have moved.\n* \"It's not the case that the flob must have movated\" - This statement suggests that the flob did not move.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\nWe know that skizzling a flob leads to movation. If the flob did not move, then it cannot be the case that it was skizzled. In other words, if the flob did not movate, then it must not have been skizzled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that if the flob did not move, then it must not have been skizzled. Therefore, the statement \"The flob was not skizzled\" logically follows from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
