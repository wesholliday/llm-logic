In other words, if the twonk was not varnished, then it cannot be the case that it was plinked.\n* \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been varnished\" - This statement implies that it is not necessary that the twonk was varnished. In other words, it is possible that the twonk was not varnished.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\nWe can see that the first statement implies that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished. The second statement, on the other hand, states that it is not necessary that the twonk was varnished.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that if the twonk was not varnished, then it cannot be the case that it was plinked. In other words, if the twonk was not varnished, then it must not have been plinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
