Premise 2 states that it's not the case that the shank must have been nugged. This means that we can infer that the shank was not plooked, because if it had been, it would have been nugged, and that's not the case.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nAnswer: Yes. We can infer \"The shank was not plooked\" from the given premises.",
