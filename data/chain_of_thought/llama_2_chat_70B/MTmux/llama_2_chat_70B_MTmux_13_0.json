Premise 2 states that it's not the case that the glip must have tragged. This means that we can infer that the glip was not slogged, as the possibility of it having tragged is denied by premise 2.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nAnswer: Yes. We can infer \"The glip was not slogged\" from the given premises.",
