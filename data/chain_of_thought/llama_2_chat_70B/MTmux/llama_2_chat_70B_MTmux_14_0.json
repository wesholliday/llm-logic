Premise 2 states that it's not the case that the clug must have been snugged. This means that we can infer that the clug was not fleeked, because if it were, it would have to be snugged, and we know that it's not snugged.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nAnswer: Yes. We can infer \"The clug was not fleeked\" from the given premises.",
