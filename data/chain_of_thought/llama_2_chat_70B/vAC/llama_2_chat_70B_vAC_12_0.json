This means that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Lucy went to the zoo. This means that the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is already known to be true.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is \"Joe went to the park\". This conclusion follows logically from the first premise and the second premise, because if Lucy went to the zoo (as stated in the second premise), then it must be the case that Joe went to the park (as stated in the first premise).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, because the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
