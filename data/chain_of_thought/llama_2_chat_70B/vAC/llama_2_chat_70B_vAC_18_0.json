This means that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\n2. The second premise states that the truck was metal. This means that the truck was not not metal, which is the same as saying that the truck was metal.\n3. The conclusion states that the doll was plastic. This follows logically from the first premise and the second premise. If the truck was metal, and the doll was not plastic, then the doll must have been plastic.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
