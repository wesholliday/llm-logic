This means that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\n2. The second premise states that the wolf was in the den.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the wolf was in the den, then the bear must have been in the cave.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the bear was in the cave logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
