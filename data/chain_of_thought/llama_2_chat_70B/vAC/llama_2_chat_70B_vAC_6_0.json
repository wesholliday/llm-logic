This means that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Bob chose pasta. This means that the condition \"Bob chose pasta\" is true.\n3. The conclusion states that Sue chose pizza. This is logically deduced from the first premise and second premise. Since the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then according to the first premise, Bob must have chosen pasta, which is indeed true according to the second premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because if all the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
