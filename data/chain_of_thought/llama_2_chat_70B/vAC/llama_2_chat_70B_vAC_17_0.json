This means that if the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then the conclusion \"Kate ate salad\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Kate ate salad. This means that the condition \"Kate ate salad\" is true.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that Ben ate pasta. This follows logically from the first premise and second premise, since if Kate ate salad (true), then Ben must have eaten pasta (true).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because if all the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
