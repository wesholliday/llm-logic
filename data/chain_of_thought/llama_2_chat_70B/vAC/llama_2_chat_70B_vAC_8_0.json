            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the argument format\nThe argument has the following format:\n\nIf A, then B\nB\nTherefore, A\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the premises\nThe first premise \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\" is a conditional statement. It asserts that the state of the vampire (awake) implies the state of the mummy (awake). The second premise \"The mummy was awake\" is a simple statement asserting the state of the mummy.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion\nThe conclusion \"The vampire was awake\" follows logically from the premises. If the first premise is true, and the second premise is true, then it makes sense to conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity\nSince the argument follows the logical form of a modus ponens, and all the premises are true, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
