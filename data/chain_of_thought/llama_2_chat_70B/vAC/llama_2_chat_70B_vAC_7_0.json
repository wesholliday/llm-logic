The second premise is \"Chris finished the race is true.\"\n3. The conclusion is \"Alex finished the race.\"\n4. The argument is logically valid if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, if it is impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true, then the argument is logically valid.\n5. In this case, if the first premise is true, then the second premise must also be true, since Chris finishing the race implies that Alex finished the race.\n6. Therefore, if both premises are true, it is impossible for the conclusion to be false. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n7. Hence, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
