This means that the robot's visit to Jupiter is a consequence of the alien's visit to Mars.\n2. The second premise states that the robot visited Jupiter. This means that the condition for the conclusion to be true has been met, since the robot did visit Jupiter.\n3. The conclusion states that the alien visited Mars. Since the robot visited Jupiter, and the first premise states that this implies the alien visited Mars, it logically follows that the alien did indeed visit Mars.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, since the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
