In this case, A is \"Sam took a plane\" and B is \"Erin took a train\".\n3. The first premise states that if A (Sam took a plane) is true, then B (Erin took a train) must also be true.\n4. The second premise states that B (Erin took a train) is indeed true.\n5. Therefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that A (Sam took a plane) must also be true.\n6. So, the argument is logically valid because it follows the correct form of modus ponens and the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
