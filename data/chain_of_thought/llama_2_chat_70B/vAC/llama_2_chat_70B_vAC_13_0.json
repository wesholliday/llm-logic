The second premise states that the truck was blue. This means that the truck fulfills the condition of being blue, which was stated in the first premise as a consequence of the car being red.\n3. The conclusion is that the car was red. This follows logically from the first premise and second premise, since if the truck was blue (as stated in the second premise), then the car must have been red (according to the first premise).\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
