            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The argument is in the form of a modus ponens, with the first premise being \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" and the second premise being \"The banana was yellow\".\n2. The conclusion of a modus ponens argument is logically implied by its premises, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.\n3. In this case, the first premise states that if the apple was red, then the banana was yellow. This means that if the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\n4. The second premise states that the banana was yellow. This means that the apple must have been red, since the banana being yellow implies that the apple was red.\n5. Therefore, the conclusion \"The apple was red\" logically follows from the premises, making the argument logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
