This means that if the dog was inside, the cat must be outside.\n2. The second premise states that the cat was outside. This means that the condition mentioned in the first premise, that is, the cat being outside, has been met.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that the dog was inside. This follows logically from the first premise and second premise. If the cat was outside, as stated in the second premise, and if the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside, as stated in the first premise, therefore, the dog must have been inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
