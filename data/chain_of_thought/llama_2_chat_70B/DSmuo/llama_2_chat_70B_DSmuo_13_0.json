It could be somewhere else or not present at all.\n* \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two exclusive options for the toy's location: the toy box or the bookshelf.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\nIf the toy is not necessarily sitting on the bookshelf (first statement), then it could be in the toy box or somewhere else. The second statement narrows down the options to either the toy box or the bookshelf. Since the toy is not on the bookshelf, the only remaining option is that it's in the toy box.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
