This conclusion follows from the principle of exhaustive alternatives, where the two options presented in the second premise exhaust all possible cases. Therefore, if the watch is not on his wrist, it must be charging on the dresser.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
