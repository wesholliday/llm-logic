We know that it's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch.\n2. We also know that either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch.\n3. Since it's not hiding under the couch, the only remaining option is that it's on the coffee table.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
