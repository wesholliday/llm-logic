It's possible that Fido is somewhere else or not in the garden at all.\n* \"Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden\" means that there are only two possibilities: Fido is either inside or must be in the garden.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\nIf Fido is not necessarily in the garden (according to the first statement), then it's possible that Fido is inside. However, we can't conclude that Fido is inside yet because there's still a possibility that Fido must be in the garden, even if Fido is not necessarily in the garden.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince we can't conclude that Fido is inside based on the first two statements, we need to consider the third statement. The third statement says that either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden. Since we've already established that Fido is not necessarily in the garden, it means that Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
