If it's not in the driveway (second statement), then it must be sitting on the porch, but we know that's not the case (first statement). Therefore, the only possibility left is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
