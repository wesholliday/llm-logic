    "user_prompt": "Suppose a flinker, a dringen, and a n\u00fcffen have the best projections to have a breakout season next year. Talent scouts believe it's highly probable the flinker will have a breakout season, followed closely by the dringen, while the n\u00fcffen is an outside shot. Since these are the only top prospects, if the dringen doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, then if the flinker doesn\u2019t have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season. Moreover, scouts think the flinker will likely have a breakout season and hence the dringen likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, the n\u00fcffen will?",

The dringen has a lower probability of having a breakout season than the flinker, but it is still considered likely.\n3. The n\u00fcffen has an outside shot at having a breakout season.\n4. If the dringen doesn't have a breakout season, then the n\u00fcffen will have a breakout season, according to the given information.\n5. The flinker's probability of having a breakout season is higher than the dringen's, and the dringen's probability is higher than the n\u00fcffen's.\n6. Therefore, if the flinker doesn't have a breakout season, it is likely that the n\u00fcffen will, given the probabilities and the condition stated in point 4.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
