Experts think the garplex is most likely to win, followed closely by the beelhet, with the peedonk having a much lower chance. Since these are the only domer candidates, if the beelhet doesn\u2019t become domer, then if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will become domer. Moreover, it is likely the garplex will become domer and hence the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the garplex doesn\u2019t become domer, the peedonk will?",

This is because the garplex has a high chance of becoming domer, and if it doesn\u2019t, then the beelhet likely won\u2019t become domer, which means the peedonk will become domer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
