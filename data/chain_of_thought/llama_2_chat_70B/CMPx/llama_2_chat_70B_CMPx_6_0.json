    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jentil, a lomfry, and a darsal are the leading gardam suppliers this quarter. Industry analysts expect the jentil likely will sell the most gardam, followed by the lomfry, with the darsal significantly lower. These dominate gardam sales, so if the lomfry doesn\u2019t sell the most gardam, then if the jentil doesn\u2019t, the darsal will. Moreover, the jentil likely will lead gardam sales and hence the lomfry likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, the darsal will?",

This implies that jentil and lomfry cannot both lead gardam sales.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, it follows that if jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, then darsal will. This is because if jentil doesn\u2019t lead gardam sales, then lomfry likely will, and if lomfry leads gardam sales, then darsal will not. Therefore, the conclusion is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
