    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a jantiz, a cramen, and a sulect are applying for one open zulision. The jantiz is considered the most qualified applicant, followed by the cramen, with the sulect having weaker qualifications. These are the only applicants, so if the cramen doesn\u2019t get the zulision, then if the jantiz doesn\u2019t, the sulect will. Moreover, the jantiz likely will get it and hence the cramen likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if the jantiz doesn\u2019t get the zulision, the sulect will?",

This is because:\n\n* Jantiz is likely to get the position, which means cramen won't get it.\n* If cramen doesn't get the position, then sulect will, according to the problem statement.\n* Therefore, if jantiz doesn't get the position, then sulect will, following the same logic.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
