Therefore, Sam took a plane (conclusion)\n\nI can infer the conclusion from the premises using modus ponens, which states that if \"If A then B\" and \"B\" are true, then \"A\" must be true. In this case, \"A\" is \"Sam took a plane\" and \"B\" is \"Erin took a train\". Since both premises are true, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
