(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument:\nThis is a modus ponens argument, where we are trying to infer the conclusion \"The apple was red\" from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logic:\nModus ponens states that if \"If A then B\" and \"B\", then we can conclude \"A\". In this case, \"A\" is \"the apple was red\" and \"B\" is \"the banana was yellow\".\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion:\nSince we have applied the rules of logic correctly, we can infer that \"The apple was red\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
