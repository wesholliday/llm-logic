It implies that if the condition \"Joe went to the park\" is true, then the conclusion \"Lucy went to the zoo\" must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Consider the second statement.\n\n* The second statement simply states that Lucy went to the zoo. This information doesn't directly relate to Joe's whereabouts.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether we can infer \"Joe went to the park\" based on the given information.\n\n* Since we know that Lucy went to the zoo (from the second statement), and we know that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy would have gone to the zoo (from the first statement), we can conclude that Joe must have gone to the park.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
