The pants were denim (given)\n3. Therefore, the shirt was cotton (conclusion)\n\nThe argument follows the form of a valid deductive argument, Modus Ponens, which states that if \"If A then B\" and \"B\", then \"A\". In this case, A is \"the shirt was cotton\" and B is \"the pants were denim\". Since we know that B is true, we can conclude that A is also true, therefore the shirt was cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
