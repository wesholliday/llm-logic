Modus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises, where one premise is in the form of \"if A, then B\" and the other premise is \"B.\" In this case, our premises are \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" (premise 1) and \"The truck was metal\" (premise 2). Therefore, we can conclude that the doll was plastic.\n\nStep 3: Check for any assumptions or unstated premises.\n\nIn this case, there don't appear to be any unstated premises or assumptions. The argument seems valid.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the reasoning.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
