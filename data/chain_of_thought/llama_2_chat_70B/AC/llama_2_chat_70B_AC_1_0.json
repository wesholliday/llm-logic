            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" - This is a conditional statement, meaning that the presence of Mary at the wedding implies the presence of Sue at the wedding.\n* \"Sue was at the wedding\" - This is a declarative sentence stating that Sue was present at the wedding.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\n* The first statement implies that Mary's presence at the wedding would guarantee Sue's presence, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee Mary's presence.\n* The second statement confirms that Sue was present at the wedding, but it doesn't provide any information about Mary's presence.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nBased on the given information, we can infer that Mary was at the wedding. This is because if Sue was at the wedding, as stated in the second sentence, then according to the first sentence, Mary must have been at the wedding too, since her presence implies Sue's presence.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
