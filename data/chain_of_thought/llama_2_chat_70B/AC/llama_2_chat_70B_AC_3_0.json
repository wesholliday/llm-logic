If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel. (This is the first premise.)\n2. The book is a mystery novel. (This is the second premise.)\n3. Therefore, the book was written by James. (Conclusion)\n\nThe reasoning is based on modus ponens, which is a basic rule of logic that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises. In this case, the first premise states that if the book was written by James, then it's a mystery novel. The second premise says that the book is indeed a mystery novel. Therefore, we can conclude that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
