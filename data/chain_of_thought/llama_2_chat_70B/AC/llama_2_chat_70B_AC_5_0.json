Therefore, we can infer that Amy played tennis.\n* Scenario 2: Jeff did not play basketball.\n\t+ In this scenario, the premise of the first statement is false, which means that the conclusion (Amy played tennis) does not have to be true. Therefore, we cannot infer that Amy played tennis.\n\nStep 4: Based on the analysis, determine whether the conclusion can be inferred.\n\n* Since we have shown that the conclusion (Amy played tennis) can be inferred in at least one scenario (Scenario 1), we can conclude that the statement \"Jeff played basketball\" can be inferred from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
