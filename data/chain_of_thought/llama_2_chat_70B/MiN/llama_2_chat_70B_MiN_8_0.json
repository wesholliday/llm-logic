If the vampire's state of being awake is uncertain, then it's possible that the vampire was not awake.\n3. If it's possible that the vampire was not awake, then it's not necessarily the case that the vampire must have been awake.\n4. Therefore, we can infer \"It's not the case that the vampire must have been awake\" from \"The vampire might not have been awake\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
