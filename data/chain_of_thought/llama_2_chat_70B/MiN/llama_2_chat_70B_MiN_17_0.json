If it were certain that the scarf must be in the backpack, then the phrase \"might not\" would not be used. Instead, we would say \"is not\" or \"cannot be.\"\n\nTherefore, from the given statement, we can infer that it's not necessary for the scarf to be in the backpack, and thus, the statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be stuffed in my backpack\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
