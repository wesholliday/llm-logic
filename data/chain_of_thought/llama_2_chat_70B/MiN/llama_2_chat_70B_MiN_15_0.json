This means that it's not necessary for the shoes to be in the closet, and therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\"\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:\n\n1. \"The shoes might not be in the closet\" implies that the shoes could be somewhere else or not in the closet at all.\n2. If the shoes could be somewhere else or not in the closet at all, then it's not necessary for them to be in the closet.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that the shoes must be in the closet.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
