If it were certain that the notebook must be in the drawer, then the phrase \"might not be\" would not be appropriate. Instead, we would use a phrase like \"is not\" or \"cannot be\" to indicate a definite absence.\n\nTherefore, the use of \"might not be\" suggests that the speaker considers it possible that the notebook is not in the drawer, which implies that it's not the case that the notebook must be in the drawer.",
