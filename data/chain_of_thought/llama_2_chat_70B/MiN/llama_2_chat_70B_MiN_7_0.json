This means that we cannot say with certainty that Alex must have finished the race. In other words, the possibility that Alex did not finish the race contradicts the idea that Alex must have finished the race. Therefore, we can infer that it's not the case that Alex must have finished the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
