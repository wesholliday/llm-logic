This means that the statement \"The watch must be charging on the dresser\" is not necessarily true, and therefore we can infer that \"It's not the case that the watch must be charging on the dresser.\"\n\nIn other words, if there is a possibility that the watch is not charging on the dresser, then it cannot be the case that it must be charging on the dresser. Therefore, we can conclude that the negation of \"The watch must be charging on the dresser\" follows logically from the premise \"The watch might not be charging on the dresser.\"",
