In other words, there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nIf there is a possibility that the griffin was not in the forest, then it cannot be the case that the griffin must have been in the forest. The phrase \"must have been\" implies logical necessity or certainty, which is contradictory to the idea that the griffin might not have been in the forest.\n\nTherefore, we can infer from the given statement that it's not the case that the griffin must have been in the forest.",
