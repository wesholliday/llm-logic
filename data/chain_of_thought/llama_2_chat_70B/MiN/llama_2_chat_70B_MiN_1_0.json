This means that we cannot say with certainty that Mary must have been at the wedding.\n\nIn other words, the possibility that Mary might not have been at the wedding implies that we cannot deduce that Mary must have been at the wedding. Therefore, we can infer that \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
