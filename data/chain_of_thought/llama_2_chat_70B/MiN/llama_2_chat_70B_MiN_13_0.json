In other words, there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box.\n\nIf there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box, then it cannot be the case that the toy must be in the toy box. The phrase \"must be\" implies necessity or obligation, which means that something has to happen or be true without any possibility of exception.\n\nTherefore, if there is a possibility that the toy is not in the toy box, then it cannot be necessary or obligatory for the toy to be in the toy box, and we can infer \"It's not the case that the toy must be in the toy box.\"",
