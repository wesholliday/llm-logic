The statement \"Either the shank is nugged or it is plooked\" implies that the shank can only be in one of two states: nugged or plooked.\n2. We know that the shank is not nugged, based on the second statement.\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the shank is plooked.\n\nSo, the conclusion we can draw from the two statements is that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
