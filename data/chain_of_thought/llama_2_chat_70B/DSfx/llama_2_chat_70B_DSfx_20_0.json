Thus, we can simplify the statement to: \"Either the fleeg is surned or it is bluttered\".\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\n* Since we've simplified the statement to a disjunction (either-or) with only one possible outcome (\"the fleeg is surned\"), we can conclude that the other outcome (\"it is bluttered\") is false. Therefore, we can infer \"The fleeg is bluttered\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
