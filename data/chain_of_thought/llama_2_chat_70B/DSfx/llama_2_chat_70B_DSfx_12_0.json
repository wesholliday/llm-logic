The statement \"Either the smip is lupped or it is shripped\" implies that the smip can only be in one of two states: lupped or shripped.\n2. We know that the smip is not lupped, based on the second statement.\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the smip is shripped.\n\nSo, the conclusion we can draw from the two statements is that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
