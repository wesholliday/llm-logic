If the premise \"the glip was slogged\" is true, then the conclusion \"the glip was tragged\" must also be true.\n* \"The glip was not slogged\" - This is a negation of the premise of the first statement.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe know that if the glip was slogged, then it was tragged. However, we also know that the glip was not slogged. This means that the condition for the conclusion \"the glip was tragged\" to be true is not met.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the glip was not tragged. Since the premise \"the glip was slogged\" is false, the conclusion \"the glip was tragged\" cannot be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
