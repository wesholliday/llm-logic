If the wug was flooped, then it necessarily follows that the wug bimmed the zoint.\n* \"The wug was not flooped\" - This is a statement that negates the possibility of the wug being flooped.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\n* The first statement implies that if the wug was flooped, then it bimmed the zoint.\n* The second statement asserts that the wug was not flooped.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that since the wug was not flooped (second statement), it is impossible for the wug to have bimmed the zoint (first statement). In other words, the negation of the premise (the wug was not flooped) leads to the negation of the conclusion (the wug did not bim the zoint).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
