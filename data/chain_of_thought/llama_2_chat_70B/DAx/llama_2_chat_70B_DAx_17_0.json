In other words, skizzling implies movating.\n* \"The flob was not skizzled\" means that the flob was not in a state of being skizzled.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between skizzling and movating\n\nBased on the first statement, we know that skizzling implies movating. This means that if the flob was skizzled, it would have moved.\n\nStep 3: Apply the given information to the analysis\n\nWe know that the flob was not skizzled. Therefore, it did not move, since skizzling implies movating.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the flob was not movated.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
