This means that if something is blummed, then it must be zimmed.\n\nStep 3: Apply the given information to the analysis\n\nWe know that the flug was not blummed. Using the relationship between blumming and zimming, we can infer that since the flug was not blummed, it must not be zimmed either.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that \"The flug was not zimmed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
