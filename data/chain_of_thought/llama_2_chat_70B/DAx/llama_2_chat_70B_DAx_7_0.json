If the condition \"the whiffle was shanked\" is true, then the conclusion \"the whiffle tinked\" must also be true.\n* \"The whiffle was not shanked\" - This statement negates the condition of the first statement.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\nSince the condition of the first statement is negated, we can conclude that the conclusion of the first statement cannot be true. In other words, if the whiffle was not shanked, then it did not tink.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The whiffle did not tink\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
