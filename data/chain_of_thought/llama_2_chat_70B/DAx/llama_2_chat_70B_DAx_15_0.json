In other words, vroombing implies spening.\n* \"The dreb was not vroombed\" means that the dreb was not in a state of being vroombed.\n\nStep 2: Apply Modus Tollens\n\nUsing Modus Tollens, we can infer the negation of the consequent (spened) given the negation of the antecedent (vroombed). In other words, if the dreb was not vroombed, then it cannot be spened.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The dreb was not spened\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
