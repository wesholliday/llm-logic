If the premise \"the clug was fleeked\" is true, then the conclusion \"the clug snugged\" must also be true.\n* \"The clug was not fleeked\" - This statement negates the premise of the first sentence.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nSince the second statement negates the premise of the first statement, we can conclude that the conclusion of the first statement cannot be true. In other words, if the clug was not fleeked, then it did not snug.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"The clug was not snugged\" based on the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
