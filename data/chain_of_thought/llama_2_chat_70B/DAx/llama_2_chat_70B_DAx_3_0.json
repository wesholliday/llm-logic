In other words, the condition of being morphed is sufficient to conclude that the splat quanked.\n* \"The splat was not morphed\" - This statement asserts that the splat did not undergo morphing.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe have a conditional statement and a negated premise. The conditional statement implies that if the splat was morphed, it would have quanked. However, we know that the splat was not morphed. Therefore, we can infer that the splat did not quank.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that \"The splat did not quank.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
