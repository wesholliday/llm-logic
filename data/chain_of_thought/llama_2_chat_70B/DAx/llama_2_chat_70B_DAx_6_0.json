If the premise \"the grommet was sploffed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the grommet plopped the frink\" must also be true.\n* \"The grommet was not sploffed\" - This is a statement that negates the premise of the first sentence.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nSince the second statement negates the premise of the first statement, we can conclude that the conclusion of the first statement cannot be true. In other words, if the grommet was not sploffed, then it did not plop the frink.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer \"The grommet did not plop the frink\" from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
