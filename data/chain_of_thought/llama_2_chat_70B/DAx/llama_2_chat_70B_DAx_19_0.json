If the premise \"the smonk was vreebled\" is true, then the conclusion \"the smonk plagged\" must also be true.\n* \"The smonk was not vreebled\" - This is a statement that negates the premise of the first sentence.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nSince the second statement negates the premise of the first statement, we can conclude that the conclusion of the first statement cannot be true. In other words, if the smonk was not vreebled, then it is impossible for the smonk to have plagged.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that \"The smonk was not plagged\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
