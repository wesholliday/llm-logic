This means that if we know the shank was not plooked, we can conclude that it was not nugged.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nSince premise 2 states that the shank was not plooked, we can use the information from premise 1 to infer that the shank was not nugged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
