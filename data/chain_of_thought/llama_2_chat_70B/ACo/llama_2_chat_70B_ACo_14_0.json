This part is not given in the problem statement.\n* The second part of the condition is \"then the wolf was in the den\". This part is given in the problem statement as \"The wolf was in the den\".\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\n* Since the second part of the condition is true, we can infer that the first part of the condition is also true. In other words, if the wolf was in the den, then the bear must have been in the cave.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes",
