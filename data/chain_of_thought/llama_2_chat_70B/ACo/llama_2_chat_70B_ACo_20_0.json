The conclusion is already given in the first statement, so we can deduce the premise.\n\nStep 3: Deduce the premise\n\n* The apple was red\n\nSince we know that the banana was yellow, and the conditional statement implies that the apple was red, we can deduce that the apple was indeed red.\n\nStep 4: Answer\n\nAnswer: Yes",
