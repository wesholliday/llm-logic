In other words, if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must also be awake.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that the vampire was awake. This is because we know that the mummy was awake (from the first statement), and if the vampire was awake, then the mummy must also be awake (from the second statement). Therefore, the vampire must have been awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
