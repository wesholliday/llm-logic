It only tells us about the type of muffins that were available.\n* The statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" is a conditional statement. It tells us that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry. However, it does not explicitly state that the cake was chocolate.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer that the cake was chocolate. The statement \"The muffins were blueberry\" does not provide any information about the cake, and the conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" does not explicitly state that the cake was chocolate.\n\nAnswer: No",
