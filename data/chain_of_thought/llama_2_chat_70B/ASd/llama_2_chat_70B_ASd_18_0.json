            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the original statement \"If I water the plants, they will grow.\" This statement implies that watering the plants is sufficient to cause them to grow.\n\nStep 2: Consider the additional condition \"and there is no sunlight.\" This condition states that the plants are not receiving sunlight, which is necessary for photosynthesis and growth.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the additional condition affects the conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the absence of sunlight would prevent the plants from growing, even if they are watered.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the conclusion of the original statement still holds true when the additional condition is applied. Since the plants need sunlight to grow, and there is no sunlight, it is not possible for them to grow even if they are watered.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question. Answer: No, we cannot infer that \"If I water the plants and there is no sunlight, they will grow\" from the original statement \"If I water the plants, they will grow.\"",
