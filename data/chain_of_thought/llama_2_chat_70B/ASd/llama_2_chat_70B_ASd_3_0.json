Even if the garage is flooding, the car being in the garage still implies that it is safe.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the additional information allows us to infer the conclusion \"it is safe\" from the premise \"the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding.\"\nSince the original statement remains true even when the garage is flooding, we can still infer that the car is safe. The flooding of the garage does not provide any information that would make the car unsafe.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If the car is in the garage and the garage is flooding, then it is safe\" from the given statement.",
