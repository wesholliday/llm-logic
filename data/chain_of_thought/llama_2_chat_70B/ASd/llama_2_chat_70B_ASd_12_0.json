            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the original statement\nThe original statement is a conditional sentence with two parts: \"If I finish my homework\" and \"I can play video games.\" It means that playing video games is a consequence of finishing homework.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the additional information\nThe additional information is \"my computer catches on fire.\" This introduces a new situation where the computer, which is presumably needed to play video games, is no longer functional due to a fire.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference\nIn this case, we cannot infer that \"If I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games\" because the additional information introduces a new obstacle that prevents playing video games. The original statement only guarantees the possibility of playing video games if homework is finished, but it doesn't account for unforeseen circumstances like a computer catching fire.\n\nAnswer: No",
