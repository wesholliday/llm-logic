The second part adds a new condition, which means that the statement as a whole is only true if both conditions are met. In other words, the statement \"If the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship\" is only true if the order is placed and the item is out of stock.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\nBased on our evaluation, we can infer that the statement \"If the order is placed and the item is out of stock, then it will ship\" is indeed true. This means that if an order is made and the item requested is out of stock, then it will still be shipped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
