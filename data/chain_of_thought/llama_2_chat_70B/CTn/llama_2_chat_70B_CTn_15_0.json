If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane (proposed inference)\n3. Consider the truth of the statements:\n\t* If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train (true)\n\t* If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane (false)\n4. Since the truth of the proposed inference (step 3) is different from the given statement (step 1), we cannot infer \"If Erin took a train, then Sam did not take a plane\" from \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin did not take a train\".\n\nAnswer: No",
