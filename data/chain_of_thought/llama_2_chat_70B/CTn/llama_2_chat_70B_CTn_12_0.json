It means that if A (Joe went to the park) is true, then B (Lucy did not go to the zoo) must also be true.\n\nStep 2: Identify the parts of the statement\nA = Joe went to the park\nB = Lucy did not go to the zoo\n\nStep 3: Invert A and B\nTo invert the statement, we need to switch the positions of A and B. So, the inverted statement would be:\nIf Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nStep 4: Check if the inverted statement is equivalent to the original statement\nThe inverted statement is not equivalent to the original statement. The original statement asserts that Joe's presence at the park implies Lucy's absence from the zoo, while the inverted statement asserts that Lucy's absence from the zoo implies Joe's absence from the park. These are not the same statements.\n\nStep 5: Determine if we can infer the converse\nSince the inverted statement is not equivalent to the original statement, we cannot infer the converse. In other words, we cannot conclude that if Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: No",
