This statement implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is sufficient to conclude that Sue was not present.\n3. Now, let's consider the converse situation: \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding.\"\n4. This statement implies that Sue's presence at the wedding is sufficient to conclude that Mary was not present.\n5. However, this implication does not logically follow from the original statement. Just because Mary's presence excludes Sue's, it does not mean that Sue's presence excludes Mary's.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was not at the wedding\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
