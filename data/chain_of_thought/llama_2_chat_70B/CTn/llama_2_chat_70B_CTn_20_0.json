Specifically, if the apple is red, then the banana cannot be yellow.\n\nStep 4: Consider the inverse hypothesis and conclusion\nInverse Hypothesis: The banana was yellow\nInverse Conclusion: The apple was not red\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the inverse conclusion logically follows from the inverse hypothesis\nIf the banana was yellow, then it is possible that the apple was not red. However, it is also possible that the apple was still red despite the banana being yellow. Therefore, the inverse conclusion does not logically follow from the inverse hypothesis.\n\nStep 6: Answer the question\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was not red\" from the given statement.",
