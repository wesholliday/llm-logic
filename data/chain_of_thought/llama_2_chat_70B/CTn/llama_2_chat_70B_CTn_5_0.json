            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". It means that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nStep 2: Identify the parts of the statement\nA = Jeff playing basketball\nB = Amy not playing tennis\n\nStep 3: Invert the parts\nTo invert the statement, we need to switch the positions of A and B. So, the inverted statement would be:\n\nIf B, then A\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the inverted statement\nThe inverted statement is \"If Amy did not play tennis, then Jeff played basketball\". This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nStep 5: Check for symmetry\nTo check for symmetry, we need to see if the inverted statement is equal to the original statement. Since the inverted statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can say that the statement is symmetric.\n\nStep 6: Infer the converse\nSince the statement is symmetric, we can infer the converse of the statement. The converse of \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" is \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
