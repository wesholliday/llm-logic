In other words, if Lisa bought the red shirt, Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the conclusion follows logically from the hypotheses\nBased on the relationship established in Step 3, we can infer that if Hypothesis 2 (Mark bought the blue shirt) is true, then Hypothesis 1 (Lisa bought the red shirt) cannot be true. In other words, if Mark bought the blue shirt, Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" from the given statement.",
