If the truck was blue, then the car was not red (proposed inference)\n3. Consider a hypothetical scenario where the car is red and the truck is blue.\n4. In this scenario, the given statement would be true because the car is red and the truck is not blue.\n5. However, the proposed inference would be false because the truck is blue and the car is red.\n6. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the truck was blue, then the car was not red\" from \"If the car was red, then the truck was not blue\".\n\nAnswer: No",
