In other words, \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\" means that the presence of the unicorn in the forest implies the absence of the griffin, which is the same as saying that the absence of the unicorn implies the presence of the griffin.\n\nStep 4: Infer the conclusion\nBased on the given statement and its contrapositive, we can infer that \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest.\" This is because if the unicorn was in the forest, then by the contrapositive, the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
