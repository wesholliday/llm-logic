In this case, A is \"Tom watched football\" and B is \"Jen did not watch basketball\".\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the statement\nTo find the contrapositive, we need to switch the positions of A and B and negate both parts. The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nStep 3: Determine if the contrapositive implies the inverse\nIn this case, the contrapositive is \"If Jen watched basketball, then Tom did not watch football\". This statement is the inverse of the original statement, so we can infer the inverse from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
