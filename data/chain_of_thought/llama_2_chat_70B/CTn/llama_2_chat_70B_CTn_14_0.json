            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the bear was in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the statement\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion and negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the wolf was not in the den, then the bear was not in the cave.\"\n\nStep 3: Check if the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement\nThe contrapositive we derived is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement asserts that the presence of the bear in the cave implies the absence of the wolf in the den, while the contrapositive asserts that the absence of the wolf in the den implies the absence of the bear in the cave. These two statements are not logically equivalent because the first one implies a causal relationship between the presence of the bear and the absence of the wolf, while the second one only states that the absence of the wolf is sufficient to conclude that the bear is not in the cave.\n\nStep 4: Determine if we can infer the converse from the original statement\nSince the contrapositive is not logically equivalent to the original statement, we cannot infer the converse (i.e., \"If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was not in the cave\") directly from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
