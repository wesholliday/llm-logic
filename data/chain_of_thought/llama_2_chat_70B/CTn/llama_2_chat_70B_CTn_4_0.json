If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars (inference we want to make)\n3. We know that the alien visited Mars, so we can assume that the robot did not visit Jupiter (using modus ponens)\n4. Therefore, if the robot visited Jupiter, it would contradict our assumption that the robot did not visit Jupiter, which means that the inference is valid\n\nAnswer: Yes",
