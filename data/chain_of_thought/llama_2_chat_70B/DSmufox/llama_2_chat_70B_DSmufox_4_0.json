If the fribble must be crinked, then it cannot be snurgled (statement 2). Therefore, if the fribble is not crinked, it means that it cannot be snurgled either.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled. This is because if the fribble is not crinked, it cannot be snurgled, and since it does not have to be crinked, it must be snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
