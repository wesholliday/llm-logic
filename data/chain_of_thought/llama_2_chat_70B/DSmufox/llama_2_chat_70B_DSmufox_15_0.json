If the dreb must be spent, then it cannot be vroombed (since vroombed means it has already been spent). Therefore, if the dreb is not required to be spent, then it could still be vroombed.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed. This is because if the dreb is not required to be spent, then it could still be vroombed, and since it's not necessarily required to be spent, it means it could be vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
