And we also know that if the flugel is not zargled, then it must be blimmed (statement 2).\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the two statements, we can conclude that the flugel is blimmed. This is because if the flugel is not zargled (as stated in statement 1), then it must be blimmed (as stated in statement 2).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
