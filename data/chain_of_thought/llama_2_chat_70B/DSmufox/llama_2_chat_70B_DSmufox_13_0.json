In this case, if we assume \"The glip is not slogged,\" then we have:\n\n* \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged\" (given)\n* \"The glip is not slogged\" (assumed)\n\nThis implies that the glip must be tragged, since it is not slogged and there are only two possibilities. However, this contradicts the first statement, \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged.\"\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion:\n\nSince the negation of the conclusion leads to a contradiction, we can infer the original statement, \"The glip is slogged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
