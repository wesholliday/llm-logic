If the clug were snugged, it would contradict statement 1. Therefore, we can conclude that the clug is not snugged.\n\nSince the clug is not snugged, we can apply statement 2: \"Either the clug must be snugged or it is fleeked.\" Since the clug is not snugged, it must be fleeked.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the clug is fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
