And we also know that there are only two possibilities for the smonk: either it must be plagged or it is vreebled (statement 2).\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince the smonk is not necessarily required to be plagged, and the only other possibility is that it is vreebled, we can conclude that the smonk is vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
