If the splat were quanked, then it would have to be quanked (statement 2). However, since it's not necessarily quanked, we can infer that it might not be quanked.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince the splat might not be quanked, and the only other possibility is that it is morphed, we can conclude that the splat is morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
