If the sneg must be sproted, then it cannot be crampled (by definition of \"sproted\"). Therefore, if the sneg is not sproted, it can still be crampled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince the sneg is not necessarily sproted, and it can be crampled if it's not sproted, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
