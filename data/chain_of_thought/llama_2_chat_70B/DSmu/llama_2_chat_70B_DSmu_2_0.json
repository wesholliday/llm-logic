The book being on the shelf means that it's not resting on the table, which aligns with the second statement.\n* Scenario 2: This scenario is inconsistent with the first statement. If the book is not on the shelf, then it must be resting on the table, which contradicts the second statement.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the evaluation of the possible scenarios, we can conclude that the book must be on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
