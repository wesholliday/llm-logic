Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the milk is on the counter or it must be chilling in the fridge\" - This statement presents two exclusive options for the location of the milk.\n2. \"It's not the case that the milk must be chilling in the fridge\" - This statement negates the second option, meaning the milk cannot be in the fridge.\n3. By process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the milk is on the counter.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
