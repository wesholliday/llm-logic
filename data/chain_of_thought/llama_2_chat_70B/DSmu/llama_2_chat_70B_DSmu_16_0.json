Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk\" - This statement implies that the pen must be in one of two places: my bag or my desk.\n2. \"It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk\" - This statement rules out the possibility that the pen is on my desk.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the pen must be in my bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
