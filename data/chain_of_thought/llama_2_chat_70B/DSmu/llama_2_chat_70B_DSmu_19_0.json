Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the watch is charging on the dresser or it must be on his wrist\" implies that the watch cannot be in any other location besides the dresser or the man's wrist.\n2. \"It's not the case that the watch must be on his wrist\" means that the watch cannot be on the man's wrist.\n3. Since the watch cannot be on the man's wrist and it cannot be in any other location besides the dresser or the man's wrist, the only possible location left is the dresser.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The watch is charging on the dresser.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
