'Either Fido is inside or Fido must be in the garden' implies that Fido has to be either inside or in the garden.\n2. 'It's not the case that Fido must be in the garden' means that the possibility of Fido being in the garden is ruled out.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, Fido must be inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
