Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the keys are in the drawer or they must be dangling in the cabinet\" - This premise presents two exclusive options for the location of the keys.\n2. \"It's not the case that the keys must be dangling in the cabinet\" - This premise denies the second option, meaning the keys cannot be dangling in the cabinet.\n3. By process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the keys are in the drawer. Therefore, we can infer \"The keys are in the drawer\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
