The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" implies that there are only two possible locations for the sunglasses: in her bag or on her head.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the sunglasses must be perched on her head\" rules out the possibility that the sunglasses are on her head.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining possibility is that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
