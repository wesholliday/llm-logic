Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" - This premise presents two exclusive options for the location of the toy.\n2. \"It's not the case that the toy must be sitting on the bookshelf\" - This premise eliminates one of the options, leaving only the option that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nTherefore, based on the two premises, we can conclude that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
