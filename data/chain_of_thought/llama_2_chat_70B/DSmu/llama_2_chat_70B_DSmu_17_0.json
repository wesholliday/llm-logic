The statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the scarf.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" rules out one of those options, meaning that the scarf cannot be draped on the coat rack.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
