The statement \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the remote control.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" rules out one of those options, meaning that the remote control cannot be hiding under the couch.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
