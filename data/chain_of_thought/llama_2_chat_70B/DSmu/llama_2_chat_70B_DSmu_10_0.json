The statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it must be under the bed\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the missing sock.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the missing sock must be under the bed\" rules out one of those options, leaving only the option that the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the missing sock is indeed in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
