Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry\" - This statement presents two exclusive options for the location of the cookies.\n2. \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" - This statement negates the second option, meaning that the cookies cannot be hidden in the pantry.\n3. By process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion we can draw from the given premises is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
