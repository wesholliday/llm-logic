Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" - This premise states that the notebook can be in one of two places, either the drawer or the nightstand.\n2. \"It's not the case that the notebook must be sitting on the nightstand\" - This premise states that the notebook cannot be sitting on the nightstand.\n3. If the notebook cannot be sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer.\n4. Therefore, \"The notebook is in the drawer\" can be inferred.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
