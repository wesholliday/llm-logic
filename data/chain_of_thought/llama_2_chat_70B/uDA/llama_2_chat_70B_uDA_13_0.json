If the car is red, then the truck must be blue.\n\nStep 2: \"The car was not red\" - This statement tells us that the car does not have the color red.\n\nUsing the information from step 1 and step 2, we can infer that since the car is not red, the truck's color is not determined by the car's color. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the truck was not blue.\n\nAnswer: No",
