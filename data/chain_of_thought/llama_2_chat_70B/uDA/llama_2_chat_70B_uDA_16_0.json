In this case, we can infer that the pants are indeed denim.\n\nb) If the pants are not denim, then the statement \"the shirt was not cotton\" does not provide any information about the material of the pants. In this case, we cannot infer anything about the material of the pants.\n\nStep 4: Since we have already established that the shirt is not cotton, and the only possible option for the pants is denim, we can conclude that the pants are indeed denim.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
