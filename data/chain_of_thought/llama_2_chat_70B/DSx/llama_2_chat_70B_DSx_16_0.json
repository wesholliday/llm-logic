The statement \"Either the sneg is crampled or it is sproted\" implies that the sneg can only be in one of two states: crampled or sproted.\n2. We know that the sneg is not sproted, based on the second statement.\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nSo, the conclusion we can draw from the two statements is that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
