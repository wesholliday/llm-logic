The statement \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it is daggled\" implies that the sprocket can only be in one of two states: cranked or daggled.\n2. We know that the sprocket is not daggled, based on the second statement.\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nSo, the conclusion we can draw from the two statements is that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
