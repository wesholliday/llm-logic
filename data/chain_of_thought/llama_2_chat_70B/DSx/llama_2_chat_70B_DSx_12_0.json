Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the smip is shripped or it is lupped\" implies that the smip can only be in one of two states: shripped or lupped.\n2. \"The smip is not lupped\" means that the smip is not in the state of being lupped.\n3. Since the smip is not lupped, it must be in the other state, which is shripped.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the smip is shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
