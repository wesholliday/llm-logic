Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the wug is flooped or it is bimmed\" implies that the wug can only be in one of two states: flooped or bimmed.\n2. \"The wug is not bimmed\" means that the wug is not in the state of being bimmed.\n3. Since the wug is not in the state of being bimmed, it must be in the other state, which is flooped.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"The wug is flooped.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
