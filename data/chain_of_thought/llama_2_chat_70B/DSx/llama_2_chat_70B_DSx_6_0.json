The statement \"Either the grommet is sploffed or it is plopped\" implies that the grommet can only be in one of two states: sploffed or plopped.\n2. The statement \"The grommet is not plopped\" tells us that the grommet is not in the plopped state.\n3. Since the grommet is not in the plopped state, it must be in the sploffed state, according to the first statement.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the grommet is sploffed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
