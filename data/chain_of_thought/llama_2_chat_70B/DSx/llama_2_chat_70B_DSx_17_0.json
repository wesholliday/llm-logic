The statement \"Either the flob is skizzled or it is movated\" implies that the flob can be in one of two states: skizzled or movated.\n2. We know that the flob is not movated, based on the second statement.\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nSo, the conclusion we can draw from the two statements is that the flob is skizzled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
