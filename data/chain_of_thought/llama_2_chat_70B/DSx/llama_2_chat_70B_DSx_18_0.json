The statement \"Either the shank is plooked or it is nugged\" implies that the shank is either in a state of being plooked or in a state of being nugged.\n2. We know that the shank is not in a state of being nugged, since we've been given the information \"The shank is not nugged\".\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the shank is in a state of being plooked.\n4. Hence, we can infer that the shank is plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
