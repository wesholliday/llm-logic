Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the wug is sproinged or it is garpled\" implies that the wug is either in a state of being sproinged or in a state of being garpled. There are no other options besides these two.\n2. \"The wug is not garpled\" states that the wug is not in a state of being garpled.\n3. Since the wug is not garpled, it must be in the other state mentioned in the first statement, which is being sproinged.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The wug is sproinged\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
