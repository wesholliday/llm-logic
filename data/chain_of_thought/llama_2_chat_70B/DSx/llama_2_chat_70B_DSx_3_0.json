The statement \"Either the splat is morphed or it is quanked\" implies that the splat is either in a morphed state or a quanked state.\n2. We know that the splat is not quanked, so we can eliminate the possibility that it is in a quanked state.\n3. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the splat is in a morphed state, which means that it has undergone a transformation or change in shape.\n4. Hence, we can conclude that the splat is indeed morphed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
