The statement \"Either the dreb is vroombed or it is spened\" implies that the dreb can only be in one of two states: vroombed or spened.\n2. The statement \"The dreb is not spened\" tells us that the dreb is not in the state of being spened.\n3. Since the dreb is not spened, it must be in the other state, which is vroombed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the dreb is vroombed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
