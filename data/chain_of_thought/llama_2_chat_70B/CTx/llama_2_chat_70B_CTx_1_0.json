            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and the conclusion is \"the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the contrapositive statement\nNegating the contrapositive statement gives us \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nStep 4: Check for logical equivalence\nThe negated contrapositive statement should logically imply the original statement. In other words, if the negated contrapositive statement is true, then the original statement must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above steps, we can infer that \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed\" logically follows from the given statement \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
