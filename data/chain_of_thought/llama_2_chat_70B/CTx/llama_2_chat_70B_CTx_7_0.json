In this case, the hypothesis is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and the conclusion is \"the whiffle tinked.\"\n\nStep 3: Formulate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement would be \"If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\"\n\nStep 4: Check for logical equivalence\nWe need to check if the contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, we need to check if the truth of one statement implies the truth of the other statement.\n\nStep 5: Determine the truth of the contrapositive statement\nAssuming the truth of the original statement, we can deduce the truth of the contrapositive statement as follows:\n\n* If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked (given)\n* If the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked (contrapositive)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the whiffle did not tink, then the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
