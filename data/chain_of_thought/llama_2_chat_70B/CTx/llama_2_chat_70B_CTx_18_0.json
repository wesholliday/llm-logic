In this case, the hypothesis is \"the shank was plooked\" and the conclusion is \"the shank was nugged.\"\n\nStep 3: Formulate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement would be \"If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked.\"\n\nStep 4: Check for logical equivalence\nWe need to check if the contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, we need to check if the truth of one statement implies the truth of the other statement.\n\nStep 5: Determine the truth of the contrapositive statement\nAssuming the truth of the original statement, we can deduce the truth of the contrapositive statement as follows:\n\n* If the shank was plooked, then the shank was nugged (given)\n* If the shank was not nugged, then the shank was not plooked (contrapositive)\n\nTherefore, we can infer that if the shank was not nugged, then it was not plooked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
