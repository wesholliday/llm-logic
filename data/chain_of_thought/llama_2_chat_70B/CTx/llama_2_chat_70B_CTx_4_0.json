However, it is also possible that the fribble still crinked even though it was not snurgled. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the fribble did not crink based solely on the fact that it was not snurgled.\n\nStep 6: Determine if the argument is valid or not\nSince the negated hypothesis does not imply the negated conclusion, the argument is not valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
