In this case, the hypothesis is \"the grommet was sploffed\" and the conclusion is \"the grommet plopped the frink.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the hypothesis and conclusion\nNegating the hypothesis gives us \"the grommet was not sploffed,\" and negating the conclusion gives us \"the grommet did not plop the frink.\"\n\nStep 4: Form the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the conclusion of the original statement (the grommet plopped the frink) is false, then the hypothesis of the original statement (the grommet was sploffed) must also be false. Therefore, we can infer \"If the grommet did not plop the frink, then the grommet was not sploffed.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
