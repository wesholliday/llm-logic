            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" It means that if the smonk was in a certain state (vreebled), then it necessarily followed that the smonk was in another state (plagged).\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and the conclusion is \"the smonk plagged.\" To form the contrapositive, we switch these parts: \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement should logically follow from the original statement. In this case, if the smonk did not plagged, it means that the condition for the smonk to be vreebled (i.e., plagging) did not occur. Therefore, it makes sense that if the smonk did not plagged, then it was not vreebled.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If the smonk did not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled\" from the given statement.",
