In this case, the hypothesis is \"the smip was shripped\" and the conclusion is \"the smip lupped the zoint.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the hypothesis and conclusion\nNegating the hypothesis gives us \"the smip was not shripped,\" and negating the conclusion gives us \"the smip did not lup the zoint.\"\n\nStep 4: Form the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is \"If the smip did not lup the zoint, then the smip was not shripped.\"\n\nStep 5: Check for logical equivalence\nWe can see that the original statement and the contrapositive statement are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
