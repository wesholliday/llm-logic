            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n\nThis statement is in the form of a conditional tautology, where the condition is \"the twonk was plinked\" and the conclusion is \"it was varnished.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the condition and conclusion and negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive would be:\n\n\"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the contrapositive implies the desired inference.\n\nThe desired inference is \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked.\" This is the same as the contrapositive we derived in step 2.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer \"If the twonk was not varnished, then the twonk was not plinked\" from the given statement \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
