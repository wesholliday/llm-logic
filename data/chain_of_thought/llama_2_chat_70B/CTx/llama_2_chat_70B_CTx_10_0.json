In this case, the hypothesis is \"the wug was sproinged\" and the conclusion is \"it was garpled.\"\n\nStep 3: Formulate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement would be \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\"\n\nStep 4: Check if the contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement\nTo check if the contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, we can use the following criteria:\n\n* If the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement should be false.\n* If the original statement is false, then the contrapositive statement should be true.\n\nLet's apply these criteria to our case:\n\n* If the wug was sproinged (true), then it was garpled (true). This means that the contrapositive statement \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged\" should be false.\n* If the wug was not sproinged (false), then it was not garpled (false). This means that the contrapositive statement \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged\" should be true.\n\nSince the contrapositive statement satisfies these criteria, we can conclude that it is logically equivalent to the original statement. Therefore, we can infer \"If the wug was not garpled, then the wug was not sproinged.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
