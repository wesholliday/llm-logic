In this case, the contrapositive would be:\n\n\"If it did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the contrapositive implies the desired inference.\n\nThe desired inference is \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered.\" This is equivalent to the contrapositive we derived in step 2.\n\nTherefore, yes, we can infer \"If the fleeg did not surn, then the fleeg was not bluttered\" from the given statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
