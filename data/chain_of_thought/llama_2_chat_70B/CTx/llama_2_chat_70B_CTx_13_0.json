            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the glip was slogged\" and the conclusion is \"the glip was tragged.\" So, the contrapositive statement would be \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement must also be true. In other words, if \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged\" is true, then \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged\" must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above reasoning, we can infer that if the glip was not tragged, then it was not slogged. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
