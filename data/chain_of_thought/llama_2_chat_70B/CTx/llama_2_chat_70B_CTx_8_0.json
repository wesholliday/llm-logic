In this case, the hypothesis is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and the conclusion is \"the sprocket was daggled.\"\n\nStep 3: Formulate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement would be \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nStep 4: Check for logical equivalence\nWe need to check if the contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, we need to check if the truth of one statement implies the truth of the other statement.\n\nStep 5: Determine the truth of the contrapositive statement\nAssuming the original statement is true, let's consider the truth of the contrapositive statement. If the sprocket was not daggled, then it must mean that the sprocket was not cranked, since the original statement asserts that if the sprocket was cranked, it would be daggled. Therefore, the contrapositive statement is true.\n\nStep 6: Infer the conclusion\nSince the contrapositive statement is true, we can infer that \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
