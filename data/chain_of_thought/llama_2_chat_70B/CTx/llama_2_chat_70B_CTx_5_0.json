In this case, the hypothesis is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and the conclusion is \"the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the hypothesis and conclusion\nNegating the hypothesis gives us \"the zinger was not fraggled,\" and negating the conclusion gives us \"the zinger was not smoogled.\"\n\nStep 4: Form the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nStep 5: Check for logical equivalence\nWe can see that the original statement and the contrapositive statement are logically equivalent, meaning that they have the same truth value.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled\" from the given statement.",
