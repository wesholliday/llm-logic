            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\"\n\nThis statement is in the form of a conditional tautology, where the antecedent is \"the clug was fleeked\" and the consequent is \"the clug snugged\".\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the given statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the antecedent and consequent and negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive would be:\n\n\"If the clug did not snugged, then the clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nIn this case, we can see that the contrapositive is indeed logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the conclusion \"the clug snugged\" is false, then the premise \"the clug was fleeked\" must also be false. Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive statement from the given statement.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
