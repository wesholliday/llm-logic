            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the flug was blummed\" and the conclusion is \"the flug was zimmed.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the contrapositive statement\nNegating the contrapositive statement gives us \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\"\n\nStep 4: Check for logical equivalence\nThe negated contrapositive statement should be logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then the negated contrapositive statement should also be true, and vice versa.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed\" is logically equivalent to \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed.\" Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
