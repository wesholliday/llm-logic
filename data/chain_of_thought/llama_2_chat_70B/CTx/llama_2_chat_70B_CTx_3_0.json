            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\n\nThe given statement is \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the statement\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If the splat was morphed, then the splat quanked\" would be \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the contrapositive\n\nThe contrapositive statement \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if we can infer the conclusion \"the splat quanked\" from the premise \"the splat was morphed,\" then we should also be able to infer the conclusion \"the splat was not morphed\" from the premise \"the splat did not quank.\"\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can indeed infer \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed\" from the given statement. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
