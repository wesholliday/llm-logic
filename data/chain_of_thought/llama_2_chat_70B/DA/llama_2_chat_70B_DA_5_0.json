The second premise states that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the information provided.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can conclude that Amy did not play tennis. This is because if the antecedent (Jeff played basketball) is false, then the consequent (Amy played tennis) must also be false.\n\nStep 4: Verify the conclusion by checking if it makes sense in the context of the problem.\n\nThe conclusion that Amy did not play tennis makes sense in the context of the problem, as we know that Jeff did not play basketball, and therefore, the condition for Amy to play tennis did not occur.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
