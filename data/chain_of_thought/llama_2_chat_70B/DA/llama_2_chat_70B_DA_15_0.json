If Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not take a train. (Conclusion)\n\nI can infer the conclusion by using modus tollens on the first premise and the second premise. Modus tollens states that if \"If A then B\" and not-A, then not-B. In this case, A is \"Sam took a plane\" and B is \"Erin took a train\".\n\nTherefore, I can infer that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: No",
