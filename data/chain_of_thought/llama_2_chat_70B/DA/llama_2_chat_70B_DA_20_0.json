If the premise \"the apple was red\" is true, then the conclusion \"the banana was yellow\" must also be true.\n* \"The apple was not red\" - This statement negates the premise of the first sentence.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\n* The first statement implies that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n* The second statement states that the apple is not red.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the banana is not yellow. This is because the first statement implies that if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow, but since the apple is not red, it follows that the banana cannot be yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
