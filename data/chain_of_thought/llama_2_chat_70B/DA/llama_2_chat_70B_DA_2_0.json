If the griffin is in the forest, then it logically follows that the unicorn is also in the forest.\n* \"The griffin was not in the forest\" - This statement negates the possibility of the griffin being in the forest.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\n* The first statement establishes a logical connection between the presence of the griffin and the unicorn in the forest.\n* The second statement denies the possibility of the griffin being in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nBased on the given information, we can infer that if the griffin is not in the forest, then it is unlikely that the unicorn is in the forest as well. This is because the first statement implies that the presence of the griffin would ensure the presence of the unicorn, and since the griffin is not present, it is reasonable to assume that the unicorn is also not present.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
