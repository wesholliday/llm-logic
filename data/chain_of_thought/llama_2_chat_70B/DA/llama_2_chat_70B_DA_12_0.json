(Hypothetical situation)\n* Joe did not go to the park. (Fact)\n\nStep 2: Assess the relationship between the two pieces of information.\n\nThe first statement implies a causal relationship between Joe's action and Lucy's action. If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo. The second statement states that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the information provided.\n\nSince Joe did not go to the park, it means that the condition in the first statement (Joe going to the park) did not occur. Therefore, we can infer that Lucy did not go to the zoo, as her action was contingent upon Joe's action.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
