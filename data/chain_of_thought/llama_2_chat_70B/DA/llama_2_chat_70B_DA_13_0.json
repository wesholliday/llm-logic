If the premise \"the car was red\" is true, then the conclusion \"the truck was blue\" must also be true.\n* \"The car was not red\" - This statement negates the premise of the first sentence.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\n* Since the premise of the first statement is false, the conclusion must also be false. In other words, if the car was not red, then the truck was not blue.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\n* Based on the above analysis, we can infer that \"The truck was not blue.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
