(fact)\n\nStep 2: Assess the validity of the conditional statement\n\n* The conditional statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n* However, this statement is not necessarily true. It's possible that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, even though Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\n\n* Since the conditional statement is not necessarily true, we cannot infer that Mark bought the blue shirt based on the given information.\n* There is not enough evidence to support the conclusion that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
