This is because the conditional statement guarantees that whenever Mary is present, Sue will also be present.\n\nStep 3: Verify the conclusion\n\nWe have already established that Mary was at the wedding, and by applying the first statement, we have inferred that Sue must also have been at the wedding. Therefore, our conclusion is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
