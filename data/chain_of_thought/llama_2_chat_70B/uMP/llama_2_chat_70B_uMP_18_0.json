It means that if the doll being plastic is true, then the truck being metal must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Use the information to draw a conclusion\n\n* Since we know that the doll was plastic, we can infer that the truck was metal, based on the conditional relationship established in step 2.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
