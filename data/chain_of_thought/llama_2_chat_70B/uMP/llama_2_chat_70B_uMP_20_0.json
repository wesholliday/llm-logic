Specifically, if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the second premise\n\n* \"The apple was red\"\n\nThis premise states that the apple has the property of being red.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce that the banana must be yellow. This is because we know that the apple is red (premise 2), and if the apple is red, then the banana must be yellow (premise 1). Therefore, the banana is yellow.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
