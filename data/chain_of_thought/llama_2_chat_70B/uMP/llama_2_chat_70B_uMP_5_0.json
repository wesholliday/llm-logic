The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis. The second premise states that Jeff did play basketball. Therefore, we can conclude that Amy played tennis.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument for validity and soundness.\nThe argument is valid because it follows the logical form of modus ponens, where the antecedent (Jeff playing basketball) leads to the consequent (Amy playing tennis). The argument is also sound because both premises are true.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\nAnswer: Yes. We can infer that Amy played tennis.",
