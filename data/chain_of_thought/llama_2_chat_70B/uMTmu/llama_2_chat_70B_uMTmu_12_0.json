In this case, the first statement does not apply, and Lucy could have gone to the zoo or not. This scenario is consistent with the second statement.\n* Scenario 2: Joe went to the park. In this case, the first statement applies, and Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This scenario contradicts the second statement.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis:\n\n* Since the second statement negates the possibility of Lucy going to the zoo, and the first statement implies that Lucy would have gone to the zoo if Joe went to the park, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
