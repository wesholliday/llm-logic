This means that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen may or may not have watched basketball.\n* The second statement states that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. This means that Jen may or may not have watched basketball, but we can't be certain either way.\n\nStep 3: Consider possible scenarios and evaluate their likelihood:\n\n* Scenario 1: Tom watched football, and Jen watched basketball. In this scenario, both statements are true, and we can infer that Tom watched football.\n* Scenario 2: Tom did not watch football, and Jen did not watch basketball. In this scenario, the first statement is false, but the second statement is still true. This means that we can't infer that Tom did not watch football based on the given information.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on your analysis:\n\nBased on the two statements provided, we cannot infer with certainty whether Tom watched football or not. The first statement suggests that if Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but the second statement states that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. Therefore, we can't rule out the possibility that Tom watched football and Jen did not watch basketball.\n\nAnswer: No",
