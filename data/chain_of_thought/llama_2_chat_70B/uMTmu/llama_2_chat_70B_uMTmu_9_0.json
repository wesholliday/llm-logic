            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n* It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the first statement\n\n* The first statement implies that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not necessarily buy the blue shirt.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the second statement\n\n* The second statement states that it's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt. This means that Mark may or may not have bought the blue shirt, but we cannot infer with certainty that he did not buy it.\n\nStep 4: Combine the two statements\n\n* Since Lisa did not buy the red shirt (according to the second statement), and if she had bought the red shirt, Mark would have been forced to buy the blue shirt (according to the first statement), we can infer that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\n\n* Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
