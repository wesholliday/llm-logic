This means that if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not have to take a train.\n* The second statement states that it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train. This means that Erin could have taken a train, but it's also possible that she didn't.\n\nStep 3: Use the information to draw conclusions:\n\n* Based on the first statement, if Sam did not take a plane, then Erin did not have to take a train.\n* Since it's not the case that Erin must have taken a train (second statement), it's possible that she didn't take a train.\n\nStep 4: Check for any contradictions or inconsistencies in the reasoning:\n\n* There are no contradictions or inconsistencies in the reasoning.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question:\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that Sam did not take a plane. The information provided does not allow us to conclude whether Sam took a plane or not.",
