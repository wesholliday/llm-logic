The argument is a form of modus ponens, with the premise being \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry\" and the conclusion being \"If the muffins were blueberry, then the cake was chocolate\".\n2. Modus ponens is a valid form of argument, as it follows the logical rule that if a statement is true, then its contrapositive (i.e., the statement obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion) must also be true.\n3. Therefore, since the premise is true, the conclusion must also be true, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
