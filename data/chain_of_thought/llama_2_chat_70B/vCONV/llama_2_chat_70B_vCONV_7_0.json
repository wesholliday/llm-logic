A conditional statement is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premise.\n3. In this case, the premise is \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n4. The conclusion is \"If Chris finished the face, then Alex finished the race.\"\n5. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to ask ourselves if the conclusion necessarily follows from the premise.\n6. If Chris finished the face, then by the premise, Alex finished the race.\n7. Therefore, the conclusion \"If Chris finished the face, then Alex finished the race\" logically follows from the premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race.\"\n8. Since the conclusion logically follows from the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
