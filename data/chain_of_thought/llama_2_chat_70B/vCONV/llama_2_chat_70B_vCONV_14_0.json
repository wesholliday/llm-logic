            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument is a conditional statement with two parts:\n\nPremise: If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\nConclusion: If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\n\nThis argument is a form of modus ponens, which is a valid logical argument. Modus ponens is a rule of inference that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises, where the first premise is a conditional statement and the second premise is the antecedent (first part) of the conditional statement.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of modus ponens\n\nTo apply modus ponens, we need to invert the order of the premises. So, we start with the conclusion and work backward:\n\nConclusion: If the wolf was in the den, then the bear was in the case.\nPremise 2: The wolf was in the den.\nPremise 1: If the bear was in the case, then the wolf was in the den.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion from the two premises:\n\nConclusion: The bear was in the case.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
