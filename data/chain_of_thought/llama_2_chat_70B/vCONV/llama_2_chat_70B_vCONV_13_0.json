            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The argument is a conditional statement with a biconditional premise and conclusion.\n2. A biconditional statement is defined as \"if and only if\" or \"iff\" for short.\n3. The premise of the argument is \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue,\" which can be rewritten as \"Car red iff Truck blue.\"\n4. The conclusion of the argument is \"If the truck was blue, then the car was red,\" which can be rewritten as \"Truck blue iff Car red.\"\n5. By definition, a biconditional statement is logically equivalent to two conditional statements with reversed antecedents and consequents.\n6. Therefore, the argument can be rewritten as:\n\nCar red iff Truck blue\nTruck blue iff Car red\n7. These two statements are logically equivalent, meaning that they have the same truth value.\n8. Since the premise and conclusion of the argument are logically equivalent, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
