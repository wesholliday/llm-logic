A conditional statement is logically valid if and only if its contrapositive is also true.\n3. The contrapositive of the argument is 'If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal'.\n4. This contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original premise, 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal'.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
