The argument is a form of modus ponens, with the premise being \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" and the conclusion being \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\".\n2. Modus ponens is a valid form of argument, as it follows the logical rule that if A implies B, and B is true, then A must be true.\n3. Therefore, the argument \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest\" and the conclusion \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\" is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
