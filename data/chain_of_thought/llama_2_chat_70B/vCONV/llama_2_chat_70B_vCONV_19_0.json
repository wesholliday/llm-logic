A conditional statement is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises.\n3. In this case, the premise 'If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball' asserts that Tom watching football is sufficient reason for Jen to watch basketball.\n4. The conclusion 'If Jen watched basketball, then Tom watched football' asserts that Jen watching basketball is sufficient reason for Tom to watch football.\n5. These two statements are not logically equivalent. The first statement says that Tom watching football leads to Jen watching basketball, while the second statement says that Jen watching basketball leads to Tom watching football.\n6. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
