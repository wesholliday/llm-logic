A conditional statement is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premise.\n3. In this case, the premise is \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt,\" which means that if Lisa bought the red shirt, it is certain that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n4. The conclusion is \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt,\" which means that if Mark bought the blue shirt, it is certain that Lisa bought the red shirt.\n5. Since the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
