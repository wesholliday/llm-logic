            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The argument is a conditional statement with a reversed order of the premise and conclusion.\n2. A conditional statement is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premise.\n3. In this case, the premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\"\n4. The conclusion is \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding.\"\n5. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n6. Suppose the premise is true, that is, Mary was at the wedding. Then, by the premise, Sue must also have been at the wedding.\n7. Now, suppose for the sake of contradiction that the conclusion is false, that is, Sue was not at the wedding.\n8. If Sue was not at the wedding, then by the premise, Mary cannot have been at the wedding either, since the premise states that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n9. This leads to a contradiction, since we assumed that the premise was true and that Mary was at the wedding.\n10. Therefore, the conclusion must be true, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
