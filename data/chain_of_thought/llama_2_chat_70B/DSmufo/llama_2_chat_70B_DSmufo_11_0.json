It could be somewhere else or not present at all.\n* \"Either the newspaper must be sitting on the porch or it is in the driveway\" indicates that the newspaper has to be in one of two places: the porch or the driveway.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\nCombining the two statements, we can deduce that the newspaper cannot be sitting on the porch, as stated in the first sentence. Therefore, the only possible location left is the driveway.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the newspaper is indeed in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
