It's possible for Fido to be outside the garden.\n* \"Either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside\" is a disjunction statement. It means that one of the two conditions must be true: either Fido must be in the garden, or Fido is inside.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\nWe know that Fido is not necessarily in the garden, but we also know that either Fido must be in the garden or Fido is inside. This means that if Fido is not in the garden, then Fido must be inside.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that Fido is inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
