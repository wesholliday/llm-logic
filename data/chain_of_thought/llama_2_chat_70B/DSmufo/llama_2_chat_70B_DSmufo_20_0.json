This means that there is a possibility that the sunglasses are not perched on her head.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the second premise\n\n* The second premise states that the sunglasses must be either perched on her head or in her bag. Since we have established that the sunglasses are not necessarily perched on her head, it means that they could be in her bag.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\n* Based on the two premises, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
