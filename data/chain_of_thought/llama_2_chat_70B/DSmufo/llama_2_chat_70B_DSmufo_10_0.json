This conclusion is based on the fact that the two options presented in the second statement are mutually exclusive, meaning that if the missing sock is not under the bed, it must be in the laundry basket.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the statements, we can infer that the missing sock is indeed in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
