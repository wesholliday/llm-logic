From the second statement, we know that the phone must be in either the kitchen or the living room.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince the phone might not be ringing in the kitchen, and it must be in either the kitchen or the living room, we can infer that the phone is in the living room.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
