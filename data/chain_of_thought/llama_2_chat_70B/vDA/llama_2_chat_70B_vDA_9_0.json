This means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This means that the first premise cannot be true, since Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n3. If the first premise cannot be true, then the conclusion cannot be true either. Therefore, the conclusion 'Mark did not buy the blue shirt' is false.\n\nAnswer: No, the argument is not logically valid.",
