This means that if the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is true, then the conclusion \"Bob chose pasta\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Sue did not choose pizza. This means that the condition \"Sue chose pizza\" is false.\n3. If the condition in the first premise is false, then the conclusion in the first premise cannot be true. Therefore, Bob did not choose pasta.\n4. The conclusion of the argument is \"Bob did not choose pasta\", which follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
