This means that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck cannot be metal.\n2. The second premise states that the doll was not plastic. Therefore, using the first premise, we can conclude that the truck cannot be metal.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that the truck was not metal, which follows logically from the first two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
