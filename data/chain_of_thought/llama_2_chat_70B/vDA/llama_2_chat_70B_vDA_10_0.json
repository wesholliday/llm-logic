This means that if the dog was inside, the cat cannot be inside, and must be outside.\n2. The second premise states that the dog was not inside. This means that the dog is not in the inside location.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the dog is not inside, then the cat must be outside.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument, 'The cat was not outside', logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
