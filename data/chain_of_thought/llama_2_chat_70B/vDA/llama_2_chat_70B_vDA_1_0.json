This means that if the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true, then the conclusion \"Sue was at the wedding\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Mary was not at the wedding. This means that the condition \"Mary was at the wedding\" is false.\n3. Based on the first premise and the second premise, we can conclude that the conclusion \"Sue was not at the wedding\" must also be true.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows the correct form of modus ponens, where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
