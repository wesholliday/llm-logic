This means that if the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is true, then the conclusion \"Kate ate salad\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Ben did not eat pasta. This means that the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is false.\n3. If the condition \"Ben ate pasta\" is false, then the conclusion \"Kate ate salad\" cannot be logically deduced. In other words, we cannot conclude that Kate ate salad just because Ben did not eat pasta.\n4. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion \"Kate did not eat salad\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises.\n\nAnswer: No",
