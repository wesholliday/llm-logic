This means that if the apple had a certain property (being red), then the banana must have had a different property (being yellow).\n2. The second premise states that the apple was not red. This means that the apple did not have the property of being red.\n3. The conclusion is that the banana was not yellow. This follows logically from the first two premises, because if the apple was not red, then the banana cannot be yellow, since the two properties are mutually exclusive.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, as the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
