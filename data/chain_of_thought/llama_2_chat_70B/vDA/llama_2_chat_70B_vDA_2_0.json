            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The first premise states that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was also in the forest. This means that the presence of the griffin in the forest implies the presence of the unicorn in the forest.\n2. The second premise states that the griffin was not in the forest. This means that the condition stated in the first premise (the griffin being in the forest) is not met.\n3. The conclusion of the argument is that the unicorn was not in the forest. This follows logically from the second premise, since if the griffin was not in the forest, then the condition stated in the first premise (the griffin being in the forest) is not met, and therefore the unicorn cannot be in the forest either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
