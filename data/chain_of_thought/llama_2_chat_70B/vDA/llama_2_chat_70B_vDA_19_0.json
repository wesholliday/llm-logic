            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The argument is in the form of a modus tollens, with the first premise being \"If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball\" and the second premise being \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n2. The conclusion of a modus tollens argument is typically of the form \"Therefore, \u00acJ,\" where J is the consequent of the conditional premise. In this case, the conclusion is \"Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n3. For a modus tollens argument to be logically valid, the conclusion must follow necessarily from the premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n4. In this case, if we assume that the first premise is true, then we can deduce that Jen watched basketball. However, the second premise states that Tom did not watch football, which means that the antecedent of the conditional premise is false.\n5. When the antecedent of a conditional statement is false, the statement as a whole is automatically false. Therefore, the conclusion \"Jen did not watch basketball\" does not follow necessarily from the premises.\n6. Since the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
