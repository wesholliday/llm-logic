This means that if the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is true, then the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" must also be true.\n2. The second premise states that Sam did not take a plane. This means that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is false.\n3. If the condition \"Sam took a plane\" is false, then the conclusion \"Erin took a train\" cannot be logically deduced. In other words, we cannot assume that Erin took a train just because Sam did not take a plane.\n4. Therefore, the argument's conclusion \"Erin did not take a train\" cannot be logically deduced from the premises and is thus invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
