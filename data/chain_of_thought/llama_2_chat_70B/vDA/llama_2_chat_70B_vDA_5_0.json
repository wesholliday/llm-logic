In this case, A is \"Jeff played basketball\" and B is \"Amy played tennis\".\n3. The first premise is a conditional statement, which means that if the antecedent (A) is true, then the consequent (B) must also be true.\n4. The second premise states that the antecedent (A) is false.\n5. Using modus tollens, we can conclude that since the antecedent (A) is false, the consequent (B) must also be false.\n6. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument is logically valid: if Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
