This means that if the book was written by James, then it satisfies the condition of being a mystery novel.\n2. The second premise states that the book was not written by James. This means that the book does not satisfy the condition of being written by James.\n3. The conclusion states that the book is not a mystery novel. This follows logically from the first premise and second premise. If the book was not written by James, then it cannot be a mystery novel, since the first premise states that if it was written by James, it would be a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: Yes, this form of argument is logically valid.",
