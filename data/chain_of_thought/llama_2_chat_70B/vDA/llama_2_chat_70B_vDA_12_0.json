            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo.\nPremise 2: Joe did not go to the park.\nConclusion: Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\n\nThis argument is a conditional argument, specifically a modus tollens argument. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. The second premise states that the condition (Joe going to the park) is not met. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument for validity\n\nA modus tollens argument is valid if the premises are true and the conclusion logically follows from them. In this case, assuming the premises are true, it logically follows that Lucy did not go to the zoo. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
