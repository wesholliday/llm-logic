In this case, we are asked to determine whether the conclusion \"The apple was red\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use the rules of logic to determine the validity of the argument. In this case, we can use modus ponens, which states that if \"If A then B\" is true and \"B\" is true, then \"A\" must be true.\n\nStep 4: Apply the rules of logic to the premises and conclusion. Using modus ponens, we can conclude that \"The apple was red\" is true because \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true and \"The banana was yellow\" is true.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
