            "content": "\nStep 1: Write down the given information in a logical format:\n\n* If the car was red, then the truck was blue (premise 1)\n* The truck was blue (premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, we are asked to determine whether the conclusion \"The car was red\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use the rules of logic to determine the validity of the argument. In this case, we can use modus ponens, which states that if \"If A then B\" is true and \"B\" is true, then \"A\" must be true.\n\nStep 4: Apply the rules of logic to the premises and conclusion. Using modus ponens, we can conclude that \"The car was red\" is true because \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" is true and \"The truck was blue\" is true.\n\nStep 5: Check for any assumptions or unstated premises. In this case, there are no obvious assumptions or unstated premises that would affect the validity of the argument.\n\nStep 6: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis. Since the argument follows logically from the premises, we can conclude that \"The car was red\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
