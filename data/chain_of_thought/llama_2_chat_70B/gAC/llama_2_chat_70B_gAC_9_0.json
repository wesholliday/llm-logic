In this case, we are asked to determine whether \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. We can use modus ponens, which states that if A implies B, and B is true, then A must be true.\n\n* Premise 1: If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\n* Premise 2: Mark bought the blue shirt\n* Conclusion: Therefore, Lisa bought the red shirt\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion for validity. Since we have used a valid logical rule (modus ponens) and the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
