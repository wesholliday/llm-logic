In this case, we are asked to determine whether the conclusion \"The cake was chocolate\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to determine whether the conclusion follows. We can use modus ponens, which states that if \"If A then B\" is true and \"B\" is true, then \"A\" must be true. In this case, we have:\n\n* If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry (premise 1)\n* The muffins were blueberry (premise 2)\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that \"The cake was chocolate\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
