In this case, we are asked to determine whether the conclusion \"Alex finished the race\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. We can use Modus Ponens (MP) to deduce the conclusion. MP states that if \"If A then B\" and \"B\" are true, then \"A\" must be true. In this case, we have:\n\n* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (premise 1 - If A then B)\n* Chris finished the race (premise 2 - B)\n\nTherefore, using MP, we can deduce that:\n\n* Alex finished the race (conclusion - A)\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion. Since we have logically deduced that \"Alex finished the race\" is true, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
