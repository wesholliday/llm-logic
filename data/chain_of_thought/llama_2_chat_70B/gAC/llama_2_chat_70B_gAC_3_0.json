In this case, we are asked to determine whether the conclusion \"The book was written by James\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Apply modus ponens, a logical rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises. Modus ponens states that if \"If A then B\" is true, and \"B\" is true, then we can conclude that \"A\" is true. In this case, we have:\n\n* If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (premise 1)\n* The book is a mystery novel (premise 2)\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that:\n\n* The book was written by James (conclusion)\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion. Since we have logically deduced the conclusion from the premises using modus ponens, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
