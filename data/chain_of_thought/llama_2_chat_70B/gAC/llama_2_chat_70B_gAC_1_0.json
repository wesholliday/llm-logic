            "content": "\nStep 1: Write down the given information in a logical format:\n\n* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (premise 1)\n* Sue was at the wedding (premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, we are asked to determine whether the conclusion \"Mary was at the wedding\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use the rules of logic to determine the validity of the argument. In this case, we can use modus ponens (MP) to deduce the conclusion. The MP rule states that if a proposition of the form \"If A, then B\" is true, and B is true, then A must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Apply the rules of logic to the premises and conclusion. Using MP, we can deduce the conclusion \"Mary was at the wedding\" from the premises \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and \"Sue was at the wedding.\"\n\nStep 5: Check for any assumptions or unstated premises. In this case, there are no obvious assumptions or unstated premises that would affect the validity of the argument.\n\nStep 6: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis. Since the argument is logically sound and there are no counterarguments, we can conclude that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
