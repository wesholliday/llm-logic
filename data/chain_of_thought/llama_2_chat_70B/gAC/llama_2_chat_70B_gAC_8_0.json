In this case, we are asked to determine whether the conclusion \"The vampire was awake\" follows logically from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to determine whether the conclusion follows. We can use modus ponens, which states that if \"If A then B\" is true and \"B\" is true, then \"A\" must be true. In this case, we have:\n\n* If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake (premise 1)\n* The mummy was awake (premise 2)\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that:\n\n* The vampire was awake (conclusion)\n\nStep 4: Check for any assumptions or contradictions. In this case, there are no obvious assumptions or contradictions.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question. Based on our logical reasoning, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
