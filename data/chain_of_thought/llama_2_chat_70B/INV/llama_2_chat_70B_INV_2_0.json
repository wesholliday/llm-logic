So, the negated statement would be \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the negated statement\nThe negated statement is also a conditional statement, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. This means that if the original statement is true, then the negated statement must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that if the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
