            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" It means that the truth of B (Mark bought the blue shirt) is dependent on the truth of A (Lisa bought the red shirt).\n\nStep 2: Negate the statement\nTo negate the statement, we need to switch the places of A and B. So, the negated statement would be \"If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the negated statement\nThe negated statement is also a conditional statement, but with the order of A and B reversed. Since we know that the original statement is true, we can infer that the negated statement is also true.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nTherefore, we can conclude that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This means that the negation of the original statement is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
