If we negate the premise, we get \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding.\"\n3. This negated statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, since if the premise is true, then its negation must also be true.\n4. Therefore, we can infer \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\" from the given premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
