So, the negated statement would be:\n\n\"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow.\"\n\nStep 4: Check for logical equivalence\nWe can check for logical equivalence by checking whether the negated statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, we need to check if the negated statement has the same meaning as the original statement.\n\nThe original statement says that if the apple is red, then the banana is yellow. The negated statement says that if the apple is not red, then the banana is not yellow. These two statements are logically equivalent because they both convey the same information - that there is a relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n\nStep 5: Answer\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If the apple was not red, then the banana was not yellow\" from \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\".",
