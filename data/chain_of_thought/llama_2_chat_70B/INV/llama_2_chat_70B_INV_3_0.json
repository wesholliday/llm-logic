If the book was not written by James, then it was written by someone else.\n3. If the book was written by someone else, then it may or may not be a mystery novel, as we have no information about the writing habits of this other author.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\" because there is a possibility that the book was written by someone else who writes mystery novels.\n\nAnswer: No",
