The original statement \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" implies that the dog's location (inside) implies the cat's location (outside).\n2. If we negate the dog's location (not inside), we can infer that the cat's location is also negated (not outside).\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
