So, the negated statement would be:\n\n\"If the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins were not blueberry.\"\n\nStep 4: Check if the negated statement is true\nThe negated statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the cake was not chocolate, it's possible that the muffins were not blueberry. This statement is true because it's a possibility that the muffins could have been a different flavor.\n\nStep 5: Answer\nAnswer: Yes",
