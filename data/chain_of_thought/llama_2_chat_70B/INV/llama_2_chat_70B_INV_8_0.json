            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the statement\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion and negating both. In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the contrapositive\nNegating the contrapositive gives us \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\"\n\nStep 4: Check if the negated contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement\nThe negated contrapositive is not equivalent to the original statement. The original statement asserts that the vampire's awakeness implies the mummy's awakeness, while the negated contrapositive asserts that the mummy's awakeness implies the vampire's awakeness. These are not logically equivalent statements.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the vampire was not awake, then the mummy was not awake\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
