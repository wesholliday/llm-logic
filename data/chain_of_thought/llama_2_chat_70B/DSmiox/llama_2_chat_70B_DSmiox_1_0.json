The first statement, on the other hand, suggests that the flugel might not have the property of being zargled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that if the flugel is not zargled (as suggested by the first statement), then it must be blimmed (according to the second statement). Therefore, the conclusion is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
