However, \"Either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned\" provides a clearer picture. If the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered. This is because if the fleeg is not surned, then it must be bluttered, according to the second statement. Since we know that the fleeg might not be surned, it is possible that it is not surned and therefore must be bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
