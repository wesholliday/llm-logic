The second statement negates the conclusion, stating that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n\nStep 3: Determine the inference.\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the premise (Lisa buying the red shirt) cannot be true, as the conclusion (Mark buying the blue shirt) is false. Therefore, we can conclude that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
