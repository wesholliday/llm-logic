The cat was not outside (premise 2)\n3. Therefore, the dog was inside (conclusion)\n\nBy modus tollens, we can infer the negation of the conclusion of premise 1, which is \"the dog was inside,\" given the negation of premise 2, \"the cat was not outside.\" So, the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
