In this case, we have a conditional statement (if-then) followed by a negation of the consequent (Chris did not finish the race).\n\nStep 3: Use the rules of logic to determine whether we can infer the conclusion. In this case, we can use Modus Tollens, which states that if \"If A then B\" is true and \"not B\" is true, then we can conclude \"not A.\"\n\nStep 4: Apply the rule of Modus Tollens to the given premises:\n\n* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (premise 1)\n* Not Chris finished the race (premise 2)\n\nUsing Modus Tollens, we can conclude:\n\n* Not Alex finished the race\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
