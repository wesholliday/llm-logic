However, we know from the second statement that the unicorn is not in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on our reasoning, we can infer that if the unicorn is not in the forest, and the griffin is only in the forest if the unicorn is, then the griffin must not be in the forest either.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
