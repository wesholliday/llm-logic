However, we are also given that Erin did not take a train, which contradicts the conclusion. Therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nStep 3: Determine if we can infer the negation of the premise (Sam did not take a plane).\n\nSince the argument is invalid, we cannot infer the negation of the premise (Sam did not take a plane) based on the given information alone. The negation of the premise would require additional evidence or assumptions.\n\nAnswer: No",
