If the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow.\n* \"The banana was not yellow\" - This statement negates the possibility that the banana was yellow.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\n* The first statement implies that if the apple was red, then the banana must be yellow.\n* The second statement states that the banana was not yellow.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\n* Since the banana was not yellow, it means that the condition in the first statement (\"if the apple was red\") cannot be true. Therefore, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
