If the car was red, then the truck must be blue.\n* \"The truck was not blue\" - This statement negates the possibility of the truck being blue.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\n* Since the truck was not blue, the condition in the first statement cannot be met. Therefore, the car cannot be red.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the car was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
