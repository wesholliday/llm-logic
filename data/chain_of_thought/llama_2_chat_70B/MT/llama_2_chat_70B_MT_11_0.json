            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* The first sentence is a conditional statement \"If the cake was chocolate, then the muffins were blueberry.\" This means that if the cake was chocolate, then it follows that the muffins were blueberry.\n* The second sentence is \"The muffins were not blueberry.\" This means that the muffins did not have a blueberry flavor.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\n* Since the muffins did not have a blueberry flavor, it means that the condition in the first sentence (\"the muffins were blueberry\") is false.\n* Therefore, using modus tollens (i.e., denying the consequent), we can infer that the antecedent (\"the cake was chocolate\") must also be false. In other words, since the muffins did not have a blueberry flavor, it is impossible for the cake to have been chocolate.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that \"The cake was not chocolate.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
