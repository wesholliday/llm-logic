(M \u2192 S)\n* Sue was not at the wedding. (\u00acS)\n\nStep 2: Assess the validity of the argument.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows a logical pattern. The premises are in the form of \"if-then\" statements, and the conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion that can be drawn from the argument.\n\nThe conclusion that can be drawn from the argument is \"Mary was not at the wedding\" (\u00acM). This conclusion follows logically from the premises because if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue would have been at the wedding, but since Sue was not at the wedding, it means that Mary was also not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
