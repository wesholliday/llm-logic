The second premise states that the latter option (the shoes must be lined up by the door) is not the case.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the second premise is true, then the only remaining option is that the shoes are in the closet.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: the shoes are in the closet.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
