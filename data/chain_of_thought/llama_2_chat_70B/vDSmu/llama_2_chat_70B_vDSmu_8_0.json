The second premise states that the remote control is not hiding under the couch.\n3. If the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then it must be on the coffee table, according to the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the remote control is on the coffee table logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
