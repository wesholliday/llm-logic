The second premise states that the sock cannot be under the bed.\n3. If the sock cannot be under the bed, then the only remaining option is that it's in the laundry basket.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: the missing sock is in the laundry basket.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
