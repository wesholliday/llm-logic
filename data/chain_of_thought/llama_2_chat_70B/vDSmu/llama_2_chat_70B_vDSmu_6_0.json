The second premise states that the latter option (the phone must be ringing in the kitchen) is not the case.\n3. By process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the phone is in the living room.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the phone is in the living room logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
