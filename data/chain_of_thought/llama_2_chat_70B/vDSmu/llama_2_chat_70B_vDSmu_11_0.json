The second premise states that the latter option (the newspaper must be sitting on the porch) is not the case.\n3. By process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the newspaper is in the driveway.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises and the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
