The second premise states that the latter option (the book must be resting on the table) is not the case.\n3. If the latter option is not the case, then the former option (the book is on the shelf) must be true.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
