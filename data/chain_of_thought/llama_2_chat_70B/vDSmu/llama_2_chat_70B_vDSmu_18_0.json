The second premise states that the notebook cannot be sitting on the nightstand.\n3. If the notebook cannot be sitting on the nightstand, then the only remaining option is that it's in the drawer.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
