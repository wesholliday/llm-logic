The second premise states that the latter option (hanging in the closet) is not the case.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: the jacket is indeed draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
