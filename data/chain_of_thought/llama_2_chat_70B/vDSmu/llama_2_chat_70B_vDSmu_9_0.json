The second premise states that the latter option (blending in on the floor) is not the case.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n4. This conclusion logically follows from the premises, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
