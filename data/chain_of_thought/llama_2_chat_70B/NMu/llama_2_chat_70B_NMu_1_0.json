It does not imply anything about her actual presence or absence at the wedding.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the inference\n\"Mary might not have been at the wedding\"\n\nThis inference suggests that Mary's presence at the wedding is uncertain or possible but not necessary.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the relationship between the given statement and the inference\nThe given statement only implies that Mary's presence at the wedding is not necessary, but it does not provide any information about her actual presence or absence. The inference, on the other hand, suggests that Mary might not have been at the wedding, which goes beyond the scope of the given statement.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that \"Mary might not have been at the wedding\" cannot be directly deduced from \"It's not the case that Mary must have been at the wedding\". The given statement only rules out the possibility of Mary's presence being necessary, but it does not provide enough information to conclude that she might not have been at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: No",
