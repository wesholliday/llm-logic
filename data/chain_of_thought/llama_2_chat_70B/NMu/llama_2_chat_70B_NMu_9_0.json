            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\n\"It's not the case that Lisa must have bought the red shirt\"\nThis statement means that it is not necessary or obligatory for Lisa to buy the red shirt. It does not imply that Lisa did not buy the red shirt, but rather that she had a choice and could have chosen not to buy it.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the inference\n\"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\"\nThis statement implies that it is possible or uncertain whether Lisa bought the red shirt or not. It suggests that there is no definitive answer to whether Lisa purchased the red shirt, and that both possibilities (Lisa buying the red shirt or not) are still open.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the inference is valid\nBased on the given statement, it is indeed possible that Lisa might not have bought the red shirt. The statement only implies that it's not necessary for Lisa to buy the red shirt, but it does not rule out the possibility that she still might have chosen to do so. Therefore, the inference \"Lisa might not have bought the red shirt\" is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
