In other words, there is no requirement or evidence that the alien must have visited Mars.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the statement.\nThe negation of \"It's not the case that the alien must have visited Mars\" would be \"The alien must have visited Mars.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the negation is true or false.\nSince we know that the alien might have visited Mars, but it's not necessary, the negation \"The alien must have visited Mars\" is false.\n\nStep 4: Infer the conclusion.\nSince the negation of the given statement is false, we can infer that the original statement is true. Therefore, we can conclude that \"The alien might not have visited Mars.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
