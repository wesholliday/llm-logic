'It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag' means that the speaker is saying that the pen being in their bag is not a certainty or a necessity.\n2. If the pen being in the speaker's bag is not a certainty, then it's possible that the pen might not be in their bag.\n3. Therefore, we can infer 'The pen might not be in my bag' from 'It's not the case that the pen must be in my bag.'\n\nAnswer: Yes",
