It does not imply that Jeff did not play basketball, but rather that it is possible for Jeff to have not played basketball.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the inference\n\"Jeff might not have played basketball\"\nThis statement means that it is possible that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the inference is valid\nSince the given statement only states that it is not necessary for Jeff to have played basketball, it does not explicitly state that Jeff did not play basketball. Therefore, the inference \"Jeff might not have played basketball\" is a valid possibility.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
