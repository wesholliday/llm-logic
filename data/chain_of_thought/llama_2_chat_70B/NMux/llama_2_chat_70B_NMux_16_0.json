In other words, the absence of a requirement for the sneg to be crumpled is being asserted.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the given statement.\nThe negation of \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\" would be \"The sneg must have been crumpled.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the negation implies the desired inference.\nIf the negation \"The sneg must have been crumpled\" implies that the sneg might not have been crumpled, then we can infer that the original statement supports the possibility that the sneg might not have been crumpled.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate if the inference is valid.\nSince the negation of \"It's not the case that the sneg must have been crampled\" does imply that the sneg might not have been crumpled, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
