It does not imply anything about the possibility or likelihood of the clug being fleeked.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the statement\nTo infer \"The clug might not have been fleeked,\" we need to negate the given statement. The negation of \"It's not the case that the clug must have been fleeked\" is \"It is the case that the clug must have been fleeked.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the negation\nThe negation of the statement implies that it is necessary or obligatory for the clug to have been fleeked. This means that the possibility of the clug not being fleeked is ruled out.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nSince the negation of the given statement implies that the clug must have been fleeked, we can infer that the clug might not have been fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
