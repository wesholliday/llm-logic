It does not imply anything about the possibility or likelihood of the grommet being sploffed.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the statement\nTo infer \"The grommet might not have been sploffed,\" we need to negate the given statement. The negation of \"It's not the case that the grommet must have been sploffed\" is \"It is the case that the grommet must have been sploffed.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the negation\nThe negation of the statement implies that it is necessary or obligatory for the grommet to have been sploffed. This means that the possibility of the grommet not being sploffed is ruled out.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that the negation of the given statement implies that the grommet must have been sploffed. Therefore, we cannot infer \"The grommet might not have been sploffed\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
