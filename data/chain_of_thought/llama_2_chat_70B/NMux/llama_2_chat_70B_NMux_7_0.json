It's possible, but not required.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation\nNegating the statement gives us \"The whiffle must have been shanked.\" This means that it is necessary or obligatory that the whiffle was shanked.\n\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion\nSince we know that it's not necessary that the whiffle was shanked, we can infer that it might not have been shanked. It's possible that it was shanked, but it's also possible that it wasn't.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
