In other words, the absence of a requirement for the twonk to be plinked is being asserted.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the given statement.\nThe negation of \"It's not the case that the twonk must have been plinked\" would be \"The twonk must have been plinked.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the negation implies the desired inference.\nIf the negation \"The twonk must have been plinked\" implies that the twonk might not have been plinked, then we can infer that the original statement supports the possibility that the twonk might not have been plinked.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate if the inference is valid.\nSince the negation of the given statement does imply the desired inference, the inference is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
