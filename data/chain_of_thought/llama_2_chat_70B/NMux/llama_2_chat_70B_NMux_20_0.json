In other words, the absence of a requirement for the fleeg to be bluttered is being asserted.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the given statement.\nThe negation of \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered\" would be \"The fleeg must have been bluttered.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the negation implies the desired inference.\nIf the negation of the given statement implies \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered,\" then we can infer that the original statement allows for the possibility that the fleeg might not have been bluttered.\n\nStep 4: Check if the negation actually implies the desired inference.\nIn this case, the negation \"The fleeg must have been bluttered\" does not imply \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered.\" Instead, it implies that the fleeg definitely was bluttered.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion based on the above analysis.\nSince the negation of the given statement does not imply the desired inference, we cannot infer \"The fleeg might not have been bluttered\" from \"It's not the case that the fleeg must have been bluttered.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
