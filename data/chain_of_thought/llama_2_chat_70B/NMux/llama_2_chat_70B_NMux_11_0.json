It does not imply anything about the possibility or likelihood of the flug being blummed.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the statement\nTo infer \"The flug might not have been blummed,\" we need to negate the given statement.\n\nNegating \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed\" gives us:\n\n\"It is the case that the flug must have been blummed\"\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the inference\nThe negation of the given statement implies that it is necessary or obligatory for the flug to have been blummed. This contradicts the original statement, which said that it is not necessary for the flug to have been blummed.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"The flug might not have been blummed\" from \"It's not the case that the flug must have been blummed.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
