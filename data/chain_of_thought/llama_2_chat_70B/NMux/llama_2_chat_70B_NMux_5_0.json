In other words, the possibility of the zinger not being fraggled exists.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the given statement.\nThe negation of \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\" would be \"The zinger must have been fraggled.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the negation implies the desired inference.\nIf the negation of the given statement implies that the zinger must have been fraggled, then the original statement suggests that it is not necessary for the zinger to have been fraggled, which means that the possibility of the zinger not being fraggled exists. Therefore, we can infer \"The zinger might not have been fraggled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
