In other words, the smip could have been shripped, but it's also possible that it wasn't.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the given statement.\nThe negation of \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped\" would be \"The smip must have been shripped.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the negation implies the desired inference.\nIf the negation implies the desired inference, then we can infer \"The smip might not have been shripped\" from the original statement. In this case, the negation \"The smip must have been shripped\" does not imply the desired inference \"The smip might not have been shripped.\"\n\nStep 4: Consider alternative scenarios.\nThere could be other scenarios where the smip was not shripped, such as if it was never shipped or if it was shipped but not in the usual way.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\nSince the negation of the given statement does not imply the desired inference, and there are alternative scenarios where the smip was not shripped, we cannot infer \"The smip might not have been shripped\" from \"It's not the case that the smip must have been shripped.\"\n\nAnswer: No.",
