It does not imply anything about the possibility or likelihood of the fribble being snurgled.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the negation of the statement\nTo infer \"The fribble might not have been snurgled,\" we need to negate the given statement. The negation of \"It's not the case that the fribble must have been snurgled\" is \"It is the case that the fribble must have been snurgled.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the negation\nThe negation of the statement implies that it is necessary or obligatory for the fribble to have been snurgled. This means that the possibility of the fribble not being snurgled is ruled out.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above analysis, we cannot infer \"The fribble might not have been snurgled\" from the given statement. The negation of the statement implies that the fribble must have been snurgled, which contradicts the possibility of the fribble not being snurgled.\n\nAnswer: No",
