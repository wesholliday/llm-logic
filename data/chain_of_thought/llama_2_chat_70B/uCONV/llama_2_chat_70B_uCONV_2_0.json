This means that the absence of the unicorn in the forest implies the absence of the griffin in the forest.\n\nStep 6: Infer the answer\nBased on the contrapositive, we can infer that if the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was also in the forest. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
