Just because the banana was yellow, it does not mean that the apple was red. There could be other factors that caused the banana to be yellow, such as ripeness or variety.\n\nStep 6: Answer the question\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if the banana was yellow, then the apple was red. The converse of the argument is not valid.",
