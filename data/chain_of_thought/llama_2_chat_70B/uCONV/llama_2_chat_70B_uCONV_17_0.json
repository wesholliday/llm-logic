In this case, the original statement (\"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\") would still be true, but the inverted statement (\"If Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta\") would be false.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the counterexample, we can see that the inverted statement is not always true. Therefore, we cannot infer that if Kate ate salad, then Ben ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: No",
