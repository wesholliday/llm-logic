In this case, the hypothesis is \"The doll was plastic,\" and the conclusion is \"The truck was metal.\"\n\nStep 4: Determine the inverse of the hypothesis\nThe inverse of the hypothesis is \"The doll was not plastic.\"\n\nStep 5: Determine the converse of the statement\nThe converse of the statement is \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.\"\n\nStep 6: Evaluate the validity of the converse\nThe converse of the statement is also a conditional statement, and it is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the conclusion of the original statement is true, then the hypothesis of the converse statement must also be true.\n\nStep 7: Answer the question\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that if the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic.",
