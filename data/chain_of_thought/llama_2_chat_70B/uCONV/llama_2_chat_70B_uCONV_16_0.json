            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the hypothesis and conclusion\nHypothesis: The shirt was cotton\nConclusion: The pants were denim\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the inference\nThe given statement is a conditional statement, which means that the conclusion (the pants were denim) follows logically from the hypothesis (the shirt was cotton). This implies that if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the inference is reversible\nTo determine whether the inference is reversible, we need to check whether the conclusion (the pants were denim) can logically imply the hypothesis (the shirt was cotton). In other words, if we know that the pants were denim, can we infer that the shirt was cotton?\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the reversibility of the inference\nUnfortunately, the conclusion (the pants were denim) does not logically imply the hypothesis (the shirt was cotton). This is because there are other possible reasons why the pants might be denim, such as the person's personal preference or a different fabric choice. Therefore, we cannot infer that the shirt was cotton simply because the pants were denim.\n\nStep 6: Answer the question\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was cotton.",
