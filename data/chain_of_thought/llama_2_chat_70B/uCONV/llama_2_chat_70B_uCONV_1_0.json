The statement \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" implies that Sue's attendance at the wedding is dependent on Mary's attendance.\n2. This means that if Sue was at the wedding, it must be the case that Mary was also at the wedding, since Sue's presence is contingent upon Mary's.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was also at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
