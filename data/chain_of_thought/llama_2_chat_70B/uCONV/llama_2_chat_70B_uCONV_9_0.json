For example, Lisa might buy a green shirt instead.\n\nSince we have imagined a scenario where the premise \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, but the conclusion \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is false, we have found a counterexample.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the counterexample we have found, we cannot logically conclude that if Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt. Therefore, our answer is \"no\".\n\nAnswer: No",
