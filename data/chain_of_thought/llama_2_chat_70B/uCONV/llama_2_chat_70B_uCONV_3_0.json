In this case, the premise is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel,\" and the conclusion is \"The book was written by James.\"\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the argument\n\nTo evaluate the argument, we need to determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premise.
