If the antecedent (\"the splat was morphed\") is true, then the consequent (\"the splat quanked\") must also be true.\n* \"The splat was morphed\" - This statement asserts that the antecedent of the conditional statement is indeed true.\n\nStep 2: Apply modus ponens\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that the consequent of the conditional statement must also be true, given that the antecedent is true. In other words, since \"the splat was morphed\" is true, we can infer that \"the splat quanked\" is also true.\n\nStep 3: Answer\n\nAnswer: Yes",
