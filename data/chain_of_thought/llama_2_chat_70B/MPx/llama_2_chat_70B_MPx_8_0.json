Premise 1 states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it was daggled. Premise 2 states that the sprocket was indeed cranked. Therefore, using modus ponens, we can logically deduce that the sprocket was daggled.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument for validity and soundness.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows a logical form (modus ponens) and the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The argument is also sound because both premises are true, making the conclusion necessarily true.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
