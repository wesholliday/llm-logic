If the premise \"the fleeg was bluttered\" is true, then the conclusion \"it surned\" must also be true.\n* \"The fleeg was bluttered\" - This statement asserts that the premise of the conditional statement is true.\n\nStep 2: Apply Modus Ponens\n\nModus Ponens is a rule of inference that allows us to deduce the conclusion of a conditional statement when the premise is known to be true. In this case, we know that \"The fleeg was bluttered\" (premise) and \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" (conditional statement), therefore:\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nUsing Modus Ponens, we can deduce that \"The fleeg surned\" (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
