If the premise \"the fribble was snurgled\" is true, then the conclusion \"the fribble crinked\" must also be true.\n* \"The fribble was snurgled\" - This statement asserts that the premise of the conditional statement is true.\n\nStep 2: Apply modus ponens\n\nModus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the conclusion of a conditional statement when the premise is known to be true. In this case, we know that the premise \"the fribble was snurgled\" is true, so we can apply modus ponens to deduce the conclusion \"the fribble crinked\".\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided and the application of modus ponens, we can conclude that \"The fribble crinked\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
