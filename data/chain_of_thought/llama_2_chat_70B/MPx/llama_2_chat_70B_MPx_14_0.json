If the premise \"the clug was fleeked\" is true, then the conclusion \"the clug snugged\" must also be true.\n* \"The clug was fleeked\" - This statement asserts that the premise of the conditional statement is true.\n\nStep 2: Apply modus ponens\n\nModus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the conclusion of a conditional statement when the premise is true. In this case, the premise \"the clug was fleeked\" is true, so we can apply modus ponens to deduce the conclusion \"the clug snugged\".\n\nStep 3: Draw the conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the application of modus ponens, we can infer that \"The clug snugged\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
