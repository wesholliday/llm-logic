If the premise \"the grommet was sploffed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the grommet plopped the frink\" must also be true.\n* \"The grommet was sploffed\" - This statement is given as true.\n\nStep 2: Apply modus ponens\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that the conclusion of the conditional statement must also be true, given that the premise is true. In other words, since \"the grommet was sploffed\" is true, we can infer that \"the grommet plopped the frink\" is also true.\n\nStep 3: Answer\n\nAnswer: Yes",
