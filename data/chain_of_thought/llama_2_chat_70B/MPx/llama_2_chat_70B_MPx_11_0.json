If the premise \"the flug was blummed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the flug was zimmed\" must also be true.\n* \"The flug was blummed\" - This is a statement of fact.\n\nStep 2: Apply the given information to the problem\n\nUsing the conditional statement, we can conclude that if the flug was blummed, then it must have been zimmed. Since we know that the flug was indeed blummed, we can logically deduce that it was also zimmed.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes",
