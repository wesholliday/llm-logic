            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" - This is a conditional statement. If the wug was sproinged, then it follows that it was garpled.\n* \"The wug was sproinged\" - This statement asserts that the wug was indeed sproinged.\n\nStep 2: Apply Modus Ponens\n\nUsing Modus Ponens, we can infer \"It was garpled\" from the given information. Modus Ponens is a rule of inference that allows us to deduce the conclusion of a conditional statement when its premise is true. In this case, the premise is \"The wug was sproinged,\" and the conclusion is \"It was garpled.\"\n\nStep 3: Check for validity\n\nThe argument is valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between \"sproinged\" and \"garpled,\" and the second premise asserts that the wug was indeed \"sproinged.\" Therefore, we can infer the conclusion \"It was garpled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
