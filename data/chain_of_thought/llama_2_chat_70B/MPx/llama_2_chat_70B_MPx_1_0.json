If the premise \"the flugel was blimmed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the flugel was zargled\" must also be true.\n* \"The flugel was blimmed\" - This statement is given as true.\n\nStep 2: Apply modus ponens\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that if the premise of the conditional statement is true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the premise \"the flugel was blimmed\" is given as true, so we can infer that the conclusion \"the flugel was zargled\" must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes",
