If the twonk was plinked, then it follows that it was varnished.\n* \"The twonk was plinked\" - This statement asserts that the twonk was indeed plinked.\n\nStep 2: Apply modus ponens\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can conclude that if the twonk was plinked (as asserted in the second statement), then it must have been varnished (according to the first statement).\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"It was varnished\" (i.e., the twonk was varnished).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
