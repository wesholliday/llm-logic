The original statement only suggests that going to the concert will result in having a good time, but it doesn't take into account any external factors that might affect our experience. The possibility of a bomb going off is an external factor that could significantly impact our experience and make it unlikely for us to have a good time.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that if we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time.",
