(This is a direct implication of the given information.)\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibility of the check bouncing\n\n* If the check bounces, it means that the payment for the bill did not go through.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the impact of the check bouncing on the services continuing\n\n* If the payment for the bill did not go through, then the services will not continue. (This is a logical conclusion based on the given information.)\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\n\n* We cannot infer that if the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue. The check bouncing negates the assumption that the bill has been paid, and therefore, the services will not continue.\n\nAnswer: No",
