            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\n\n\"If I finish my homework, I can play video games.\"\n\nThis statement implies that finishing homework is a sufficient condition to play video games. In other words, if the condition of finishing homework is met, then the conclusion of playing video games follows.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the additional information\n\n\"Can we infer that if I finish my homework and my computer catches on fire, I can play video games?\"\n\nThis question introduces a new condition - \"my computer catches on fire\" - which was not present in the original statement.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the inference\n\nTo determine whether we can infer that playing video games is possible in this scenario, we need to consider both conditions: finishing homework and the computer catching on fire.\n\nFinishing homework is still a sufficient condition for playing video games, but the additional condition of the computer catching on fire creates a problem. If the computer is on fire, it may not be functional or safe to use, which could prevent playing video games.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we cannot infer that playing video games is possible in this scenario. The additional condition of the computer catching on fire introduces a new factor that may prevent playing video games, even if the condition of finishing homework is met.\n\nAnswer: No",
