            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the premise\nThe premise is that fertilizing the lawn will make it lush and green.\n\nStep 2: Consider the context\nThe context is a drought. A drought is a period of abnormally low rainfall, which can affect the health and appearance of grass and other plants.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the relationship between fertilization and drought\nFertilization can help promote healthy growth and appearance of grass, but it does not guarantee that the lawn will be unaffected by a drought. In fact, during a drought, even fertilized lawns can become stressed and turn brown or yellow due to lack of water.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above reasoning, it is not safe to infer that if I fertilize the lawn and there is a drought, it will be lush and green. Fertilization can help, but it is not a guarantee against the effects of a drought.\n\nAnswer: No",
