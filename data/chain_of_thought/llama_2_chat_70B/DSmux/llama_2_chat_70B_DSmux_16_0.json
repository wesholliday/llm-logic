Since the second statement says that it's not the case that the sneg must be sproted, we can conclude that the sneg is not sproted.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince the sneg is not sproted and it can either be crampled or it must be sproted, we can infer that the sneg is crampled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
