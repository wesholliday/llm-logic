The second statement tells us that the twonk is not required to be plinked, which means that it's possible for the twonk to be varnished.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the twonk is varnished. This is because the only other option, according to the first statement, is that the twonk must be plinked, but we know from the second statement that this is not the case. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that the twonk is varnished.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
