There is no third option.\n* \"It's not the case that the glip must be tragged\" means that the glip does not have to be tragged.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the statements\n\nFrom the first statement, we know that the glip is either slogged or must be tragged. Since the second statement says that it's not the case that the glip must be tragged, we can conclude that the glip is not tragged.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the two statements, we can infer that the glip is slogged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
