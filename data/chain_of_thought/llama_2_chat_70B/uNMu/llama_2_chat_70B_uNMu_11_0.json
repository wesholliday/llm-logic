This means that there is a possibility that the newspaper might not be in the driveway, even if it is usually delivered there.\n\nTherefore, based on this statement, we can infer that the newspaper might not be in the driveway. However, we cannot say for sure whether the newspaper is actually in the driveway or not without additional information.",
