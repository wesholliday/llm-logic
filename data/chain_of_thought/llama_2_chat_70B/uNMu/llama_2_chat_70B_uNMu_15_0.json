The word \"must\" indicates a necessity or obligation, and by negating it, we are left with the possibility that the shoes might not be in the closet.\n\nTherefore, based on this statement, we can infer that the shoes might not be in the closet, but we cannot conclusively say that they are not in the closet without additional information.",
