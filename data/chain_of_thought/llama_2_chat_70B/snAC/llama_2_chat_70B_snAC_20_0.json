If the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true, it means that there is a conditional relationship between the color of the apple and the color of the banana.\n2. The statement \"The banana was yellow\" is true, which means that the condition in step 1 is satisfied.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the apple was red, since the premise of the conditional statement has been satisfied.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
