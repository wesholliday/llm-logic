Therefore, the alien visited Mars (conclusion)\n\nI have used modus ponens to arrive at the conclusion. Modus ponens is a valid form of argument where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, the premises are 'If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter' and 'The robot visited Jupiter', so the conclusion 'The alien visited Mars' logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
