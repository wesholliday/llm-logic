If \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, it means that whenever Lisa buys the red shirt, Mark will definitely buy the blue shirt.\n2. We know that \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true. This means that Mark did indeed buy the blue shirt.\n3. Since Mark bought the blue shirt, it must be the case that Lisa bought the red shirt, because if she didn't, then Mark wouldn't have bought the blue shirt (according to the first premise).\n4. Therefore, \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
