If the mummy is awake, then the vampire must be awake.\n* The second statement simply states that the mummy is indeed awake.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\n* Since the mummy is awake, and the vampire's awakeness is dependent on the mummy's awakeness, it logically follows that the vampire must be awake as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
