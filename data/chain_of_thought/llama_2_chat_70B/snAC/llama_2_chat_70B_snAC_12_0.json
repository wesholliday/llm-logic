If \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, it means that there is a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n2. The statement \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, which means that the condition in step 1 has been satisfied.\n3. Therefore, based on the conditional relationship established in step 1, it follows that \"Joe went to the park\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
