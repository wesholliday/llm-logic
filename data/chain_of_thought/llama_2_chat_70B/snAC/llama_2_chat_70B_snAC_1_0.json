We know that \"Sue was at the wedding\" is true. This means that Sue was present at the wedding.\n3. Since we know that Sue was at the wedding and we also know that whenever Mary is at a wedding, Sue is also at that wedding, it logically follows that Mary must have been at the wedding as well.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
