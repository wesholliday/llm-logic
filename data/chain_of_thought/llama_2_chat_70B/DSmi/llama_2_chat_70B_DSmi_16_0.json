'Either the pen is in my bag or it must be on my desk' implies that the pen is either in the speaker's bag or on their desk.\n2. 'The pen might not be on my desk' suggests that the pen is not necessarily on the speaker's desk.\n3. If the pen is not on the speaker's desk, then it must be in their bag, since those are the only two possibilities given by the first premise.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that the pen is in the speaker's bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
