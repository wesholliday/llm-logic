The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that the notebook cannot be in any other location besides the drawer or the nightstand.\n2. The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" suggests that the notebook's presence on the nightstand is uncertain or questionable.\n3. If the notebook is not on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer, as it cannot be in any other location.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
