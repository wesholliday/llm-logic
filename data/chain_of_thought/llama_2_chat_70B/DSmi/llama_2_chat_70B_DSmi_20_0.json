The statement \"Either the sunglasses are in her bag or they must be perched on her head\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the sunglasses.\n2. The phrase \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that the second option, \"they must be perched on her head,\" is not necessarily true.\n3. If the sunglasses are not perched on her head, then the first option, \"the sunglasses are in her bag,\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the sunglasses are in her bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
