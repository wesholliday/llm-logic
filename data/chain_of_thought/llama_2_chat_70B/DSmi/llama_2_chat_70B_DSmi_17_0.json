The statement \"Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the scarf.\n2. The phrase \"The scarf might not be draped on the coat rack\" implies that the second option (the scarf being draped on the coat rack) is not certain or guaranteed.\n3. If the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then the first option (the scarf being stuffed in my backpack) becomes the only possible location for the scarf.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the scarf is indeed stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
