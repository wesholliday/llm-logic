The premise \"Either the remote control is on the coffee table or it must be hiding under the couch\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the remote control.\n2. The sentence \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" implies that the second option, the remote control being under the couch, is uncertain or unlikely.\n3. If the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then the first option, the remote control being on the coffee table, becomes the only possible location for the remote control.\n4. Therefore, based on the given information, it is reasonable to infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
