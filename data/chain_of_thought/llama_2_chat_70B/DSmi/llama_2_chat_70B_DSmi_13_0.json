The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the toy.\n2. The statement \"The toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that the second option, the toy being on the bookshelf, is not certain or guaranteed.\n3. If the toy is not on the bookshelf, then the first option, the toy being in the toy box, becomes the only possible location for the toy.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
