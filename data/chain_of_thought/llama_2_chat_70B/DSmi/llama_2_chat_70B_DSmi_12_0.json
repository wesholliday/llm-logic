The statement \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the jacket.\n2. The phrase \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies that the second option, the jacket being hanging in the closet, is uncertain or possibly false.\n3. If the second option is false, then the first option, the jacket being draped over the chair, must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the jacket is indeed draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
