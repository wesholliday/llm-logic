            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statements\n\n* \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble must have crinked\" - This statement implies that snurgling a fribble necessarily leads to crinkling.\n* \"The fribble might not have crinked\" - This statement suggests that it's possible the fribble didn't crinkle, but doesn't confirm or deny whether it actually did.\n\nStep 2: Assess the relationship between the statements\n\nWe can see that the first statement implies a causal relationship between snurgling and crinkling. The second statement only provides uncertain information about the possibility of crinkling.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the relationship\n\nGiven the uncertainty in the second statement, we cannot confidently infer that the fribble was not snurgled. The absence of crinkling doesn't necessarily mean the fribble wasn't snurgled, as there might be other factors preventing crinkling.\n\nAnswer: No",
