This means that if the smip did not lupped the zoint, then it cannot be the case that the smip was shripped.\n\nPremise 2 states that the smip might not have lupped the zoint. This means that it is possible that the smip did not lupped the zoint.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nSince premise 1 states that if the smip was shripped, then it must have lupped the zoint, and premise 2 states that it is possible that the smip did not lupped the zoint, we can infer that it is possible that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
