Premise 2 suggests that the sprocket might not have been daggled.\n\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion:\nGiven the relationship between the premises, we can infer that if the sprocket might not have been daggled (premise 2), then it is possible that the sprocket was not cranked (conclusion).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
