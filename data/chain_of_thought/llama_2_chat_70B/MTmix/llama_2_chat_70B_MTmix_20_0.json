Premise 2 suggests that it might not have been surned. These two premises are in conflict with each other.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possible conclusions:\n\nIf we combine the two premises, we can see that if the fleeg was bluttered, then it must have been surned (premise 1), but it might not have been surned (premise 2). This means that the conclusion \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" logically follows.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion:\n\nBased on the analysis of the premises, the conclusion \"The fleeg was not bluttered\" is a valid inference.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
