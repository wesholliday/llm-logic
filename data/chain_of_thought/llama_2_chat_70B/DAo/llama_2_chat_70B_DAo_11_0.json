Specifically, if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry.\n\nStep 3: Use modus tollens to deduce a conclusion about the muffins\n\n* Modus tollens: If A implies B, and not-A, then not-B\n* In this case, A is \"the cake is chocolate\" and B is \"the muffins are blueberry\"\n* Not-A is \"the cake is not chocolate\" (given)\n* Therefore, we can deduce not-B, or \"the muffins are not blueberry\"\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"The muffins were not blueberry\" from the given information.",
