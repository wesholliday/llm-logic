In this case, the statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding too.\n\nStep 3: Use the information to draw a conclusion\n\nWe know that Mary was not at the wedding. Using the conditional statement, we can infer that since Mary was not at the wedding, it is impossible for Sue to have been at the wedding too.\n\nStep 4: Check for logical consistency\n\nThe conclusion we drew (Sue was not at the wedding) is logically consistent with the given information. It does not contradict either statement, and it follows logically from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
