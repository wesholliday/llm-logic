Therefore, we can conclude that Erin did not take a train, because if Sam had taken a plane, Erin would have taken a train, but since Sam did not take a plane, Erin did not take a train.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that Erin did not take a train.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
