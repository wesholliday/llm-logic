Since we know that the griffin is not in the forest, we can infer that the unicorn is not in the forest either.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that the statement \"The unicorn was not in the forest\" logically follows from the given information.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
