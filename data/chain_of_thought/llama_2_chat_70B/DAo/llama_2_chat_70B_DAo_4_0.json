Therefore, we can conclude that the condition in the second statement (\"If the alien visited Mars\") is false. This means that the conclusion of the second statement (\"then the robot visited Jupiter\") cannot be deduced.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince we cannot deduce whether the robot visited Jupiter or not, we cannot infer \"The robot did not visit Jupiter.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
