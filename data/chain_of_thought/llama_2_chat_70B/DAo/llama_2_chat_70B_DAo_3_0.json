(This is given in the second premise.)\n2. The book was not written by James. (This is given in the first premise.)\n3. If the book was not written by James, then it's not a mystery novel. (This follows logically from the first two premises. If the book wasn't written by James, then it couldn't be a mystery novel, since we know that if it were written by James, it would be a mystery novel.)\n\nTherefore, based on these three steps of reasoning, we can conclude that the book is not a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
