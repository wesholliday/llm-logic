            "content": "\nStep 1: Write down the given information in a logical format:\n\n* Premise 1: Jeff did not play basketball.\n* Premise 2: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n\nStep 2: Assess the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, we want to infer \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nStep 3: Work backwards from the conclusion to determine if it can be logically deduced from the premises.\n\n* Hypothetical scenario: Amy played tennis.\n* Apply Premise 2: If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis. Since Amy played tennis, it means that Jeff played basketball.\n* Contradiction: We know that Jeff did not play basketball (from Premise 1). Therefore, our hypothetical scenario leads to a logical contradiction.\n\nStep 4: Consider alternative scenarios that could still be consistent with the premises. In this case, there are no other possible scenarios that would allow us to infer \"Amy did not play tennis.\"\n\nStep 5: Based on the above analysis, determine if we can logically deduce \"Amy did not play tennis\" from the given premises. Since we have shown that the only possible scenario leads to a logical contradiction, we can conclude that \"Amy did not play tennis\" cannot be inferred from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
