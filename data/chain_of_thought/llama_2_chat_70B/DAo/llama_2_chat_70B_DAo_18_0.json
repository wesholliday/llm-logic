            "content": "\nStep 1: Write down the given information in a logical format:\n\n* The doll was not plastic.\n* If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal.\n\nStep 2: Assess the relationship between the two premises:\n\nThe first premise states that the doll was not plastic. The second premise is a conditional statement, which means that it describes a hypothetical situation and its consequences. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the doll was plastic,\" and the consequence is \"the truck was metal.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine the conclusion that can be drawn from the premises:\n\nGiven the information, we cannot directly infer whether the truck was metal or not. However, we can deduce that since the doll was not plastic, the hypothesis of the second premise (\"the doll was plastic\") is false. Therefore, the conclusion of the second premise (\"the truck was metal\") also becomes false.\n\nStep 4: Formulate a clear answer:\n\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer that the truck was not metal. The given information only allows us to deduce that the doll was not plastic and that the hypothesis of the second premise is false. It does not provide enough evidence to make a conclusion about the material of the truck.",
