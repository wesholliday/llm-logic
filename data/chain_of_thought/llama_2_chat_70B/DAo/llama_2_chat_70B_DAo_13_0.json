            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"The car was not red\" means that the car was not painted red.\n* \"If the car was red, then the truck was blue\" means that if the car had been painted red, then the truck would have been painted blue.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\nThe first statement does not provide any information about the color of the truck. The second statement establishes a conditional relationship between the color of the car and the color of the truck. Specifically, if the car were red, then the truck would be blue. However, since the car is not red, we cannot infer the color of the truck directly from this statement.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince we cannot infer the color of the truck directly from the given statements, our answer must be \"no\" - we cannot conclude that the truck was not blue. It is possible that the truck could have been painted blue, or it could have been painted a different color altogether. Without additional information, we cannot say for certain.\n\nAnswer: No",
