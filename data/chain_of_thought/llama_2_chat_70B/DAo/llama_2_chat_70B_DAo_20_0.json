If the apple is not red, then the banana's color is not determined by this statement.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we cannot infer the color of the banana. The statement \"The banana was not yellow\" cannot be logically deduced from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
