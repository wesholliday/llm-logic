If the fleeg were surned, then it would have to be the case that the fleeg must be surned (statement 2), but this is not the case. Therefore, we can conclude that the fleeg is not surned.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince the fleeg is not surned and statement 2 says that either the fleeg is bluttered or it must be surned, we can infer that the fleeg is bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
