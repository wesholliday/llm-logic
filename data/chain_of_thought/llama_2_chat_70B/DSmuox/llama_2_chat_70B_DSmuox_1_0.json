If the flugel were to be zargled, it would contradict statement 1. Therefore, we can conclude that the flugel is not zargled.\n\nSince the flugel is not zargled, we can turn our attention to the second statement: \"Either the flugel is blimmed or it must be zargled.\" We know that the flugel is not zargled, so the only remaining possibility is that it is blimmed.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can conclude that the flugel is indeed blimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
