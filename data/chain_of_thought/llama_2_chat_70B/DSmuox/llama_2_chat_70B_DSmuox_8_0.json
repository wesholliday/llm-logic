If the sprocket were daggled, then it would be necessary for it to be daggled (since it's not cranked), which contradicts statement 1. Therefore, we can conclude that the sprocket is not daggled.\n\nSince the sprocket is not daggled, we can apply the second statement: \"Either the sprocket is cranked or it must be daggled.\" Since the sprocket is not daggled, it must be cranked.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the two given statements, we can infer that the sprocket is cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
