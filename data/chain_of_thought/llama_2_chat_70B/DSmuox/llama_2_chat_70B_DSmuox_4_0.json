If the fribble were to be crinked, it would contradict statement 1. Therefore, we can conclude that the fribble is not crinked.\n\nNow, let's consider the second statement: \"Either the fribble is snurgled or it must be crinked.\" Since we have established that the fribble is not crinked, the only remaining possibility is that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis above, we can infer that the fribble is snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
