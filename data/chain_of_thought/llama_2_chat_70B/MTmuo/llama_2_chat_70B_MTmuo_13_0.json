            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"It's not the case that the truck must have been blue\" means that the truck being blue is not a necessity, or in other words, it's possible for the truck to be any color other than blue.\n* \"If the car was red, then the truck must have been blue\" means that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue, but since we know the truck is not necessarily blue, this statement does not imply that the car is red.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that the truck's color is not fixed and can be any color other than blue. From the second statement, we know that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue, but since the truck's color is not fixed, it's possible for the car to be red and the truck to be a color other than blue.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the car was not red because if the car were red, then the truck would have to be blue, but since the truck's color is not fixed and can be any color other than blue, it's possible for the car to be red and the truck to be a different color.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
