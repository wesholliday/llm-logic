If that's the case, then according to the second statement, Kate must have eaten salad. But we know that it's not the case that Kate must have eaten salad, so this assumption leads to a contradiction.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that Ben did not eat pasta. If Ben had eaten pasta, it would have led to a contradiction, so it's not possible that he ate pasta.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
