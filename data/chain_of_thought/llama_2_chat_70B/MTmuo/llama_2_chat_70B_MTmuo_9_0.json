            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" means that Mark didn't necessarily buy the blue shirt. It's possible, but not certain.\n* \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" means that if Lisa did buy the red shirt, then it's certain that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\nLet's assume that Lisa did buy the red shirt. If that's the case, then according to the second statement, Mark must have bought the blue shirt. But we know that it's not certain that Mark bought the blue shirt (from the first statement). This means that there's a possibility that Mark didn't buy the blue shirt, even though Lisa bought the red shirt.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that it's possible for Lisa to have bought the red shirt without Mark buying the blue shirt. Therefore, the statement \"Lisa did not buy the red shirt\" cannot be inferred from the given information.\n\nAnswer: No",
