If the shirt is cotton, then according to the second statement, the pants must be denim. However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that it's not necessary for the pants to be denim.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
