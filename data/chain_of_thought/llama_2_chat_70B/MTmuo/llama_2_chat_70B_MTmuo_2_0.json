If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must have been in the forest, but we already know that the unicorn's presence in the forest is not necessarily true. Therefore, we can infer that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can conclude that the griffin was not in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
