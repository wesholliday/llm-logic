From the second statement, we know that if Mary attended the wedding, then Sue must have attended too.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nIf we combine the two statements, we can infer that Mary did not attend the wedding. If Mary had attended the wedding, then Sue would have had to attend too, but since Sue's attendance is not necessarily true, it means that Mary did not attend the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
