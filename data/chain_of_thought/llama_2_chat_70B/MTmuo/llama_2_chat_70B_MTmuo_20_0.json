This means that the banana could have been red, green, blue, or any other color except yellow.\n\nFrom the second statement, we know that if the apple was red, then the banana must have been yellow. Since the banana is not yellow, we can conclude that the apple cannot be red.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis of the two statements, we can infer that the apple was not red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
