If Sam took a plane, then according to the second statement, Erin must have taken a train. However, this contradicts the first statement, which states that it's not necessary or certain that Erin took a train.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that Sam did not take a plane. If Sam had taken a plane, it would have contradicted the first statement, and we would have concluded that Erin must have taken a train. Since this is not the case, it means that Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: No",
