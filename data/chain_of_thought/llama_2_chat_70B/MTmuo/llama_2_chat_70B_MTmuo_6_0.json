However, we know that Bob did not necessarily choose pasta (from the first statement). This means that there is a possibility that Sue did not choose pizza, since if she had, Bob would have been forced to choose pasta.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza. This is because if she had chosen pizza, Bob would have been forced to choose pasta, but we know that Bob did not necessarily choose pasta. Therefore, the only possibility is that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
