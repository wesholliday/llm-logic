From the second statement, we know that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nIf Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race (based on the second statement). However, since it's not the case that Chris must have finished the race (based on the first statement), we can infer that Alex did not finish the race.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
