From the second statement, we know that if the dog was inside, then the cat must be outside.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nIf the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside, based on the second statement. However, we also know from the first statement that the cat could have been either inside or outside. Therefore, we cannot conclusively infer that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: No",
