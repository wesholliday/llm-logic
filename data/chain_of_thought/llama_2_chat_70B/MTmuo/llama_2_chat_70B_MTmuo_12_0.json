It's possible but not certain.\n* \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" means that if Joe went to the park, then it's necessary that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\nWe know that Lucy didn't necessarily go to the zoo, and if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy's going to the zoo is certain.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince Lucy didn't necessarily go to the zoo, and her going to the zoo is certain only if Joe went to the park, we can infer that Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
