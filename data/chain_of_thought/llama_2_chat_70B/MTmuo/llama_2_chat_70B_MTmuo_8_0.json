If the vampire was awake, then according to the second premise, the mummy must have been awake. However, since the mummy's being awake is not necessarily true, we cannot conclude that the vampire was awake.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we cannot infer \"The vampire was not awake\" from the given premises. The most we can say is that we don't know whether the vampire or the mummy were awake.\n\nAnswer: No",
