If we combine these two statements, we can infer that Tom did not watch football, because if he had, then Jen would have necessarily watched basketball, which contradicts the first statement.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that Tom did not watch football.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
