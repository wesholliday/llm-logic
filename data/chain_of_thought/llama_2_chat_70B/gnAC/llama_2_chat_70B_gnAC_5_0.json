In this case, we are asked to determine whether \"Jeff played basketball\" is true based on the given information.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to arrive at a conclusion. We can use modus ponens, which states that if \"If A then B\" is true and \"B\" is true, then \"A\" must be true. In this case, we have:\n\n* If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis (premise 1)\n* Amy played tennis (premise 2)\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Jeff played basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
