If \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" is true, it means that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" implies the consequence \"Erin took a train\".\n2. We know that \"Erin took a train\" is true.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the condition \"Sam took a plane\" must also be true, since the consequence \"Erin took a train\" has been established as true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
