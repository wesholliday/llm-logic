            "content": "\nStep 1: Write down the given information in a logical format:\n\n* If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding (premise 1)\n* Sue was at the wedding (premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, we are asked to determine if the conclusion \"Mary was at the wedding\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use the rules of logic to determine the validity of the argument. In this case, we can use Modus Ponens (MP) to conclude that Mary was at the wedding. MP states that if \"If A then B\" is true and \"B\" is true, then \"A\" must be true.\n\nStep 4: Check for any assumptions or unstated premises that might affect the argument's validity. In this case, there don't appear to be any additional assumptions or unstated premises that would impact the argument's validity.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis. Since we have determined that the argument is logically sound using Modus Ponens, and there are no unstated premises or assumptions that would affect its validity, it necessarily follows that \"Mary was at the wedding\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
