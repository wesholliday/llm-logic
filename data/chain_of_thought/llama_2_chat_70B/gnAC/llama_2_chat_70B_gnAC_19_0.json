Specifically, if Tom watches football, then Jen watches basketball.\n\nPremise 2 states that Jen watched basketball.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nIn this case, we can use modus ponens, a rule of inference that allows us to deduce the conclusion from the premises. Modus ponens states that if \"If A then B\" is true, and \"B\" is true, then \"A\" must be true.\n\nApplying modus ponens, we have:\n\n* If Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball (premise 1)\n* Jen watched basketball (premise 2)\n\nTherefore, Tom watched football.\n\nStep 4: Check for any assumptions or unstated premises.\n\nIn this case, there are no obvious assumptions or unstated premises that need to be considered.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
