In this case, we are asked to determine if the conclusion \"The vampire was awake\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. We can use modus ponens, a basic rule of logic that states:\n\nIf A \u2192 B and B is true, then A must be true.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA \u2192 B (premise 1)\nB (premise 2)\n\nTherefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that:\n\nA (the vampire was awake) must be true.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question based on our reasoning. Since we have determined that the conclusion logically follows from the premises, we can answer:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
