In this case, we are asked to determine if the conclusion \"The dog was inside\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use modus ponens to deduce the conclusion. Modus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises, one of which is a conditional statement. The formula for modus ponens is:\n\n(If A then B) AND B\n\nTherefore, A\n\nIn this case, we can apply modus ponens as follows:\n\n* Premise 1: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\n* Premise 2: The cat was outside\n\nUsing modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion:\n\n* The dog was inside\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion. Since we have logically deduced the conclusion \"The dog was inside\" from the premises, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
