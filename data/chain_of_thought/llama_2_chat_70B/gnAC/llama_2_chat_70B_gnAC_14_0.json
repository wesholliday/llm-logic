If the antecedent (B) is false, the statement is true regardless of the consequent (W).\n2. If the consequent (W) is false, the statement is false regardless of the antecedent (B).\n3. If both the antecedent (B) and consequent (W) are true, the statement is valid.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules to the given information\n\nSince the antecedent (B) is not explicitly stated as false, we assume it's true. The consequent (W) is also true. Therefore, according to rule 3, the argument is valid, and we can conclude that 'The bear was in the cave' is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
