The conclusion we want to draw is whether \"Joe went to the park\" is true.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules of logic to determine the validity of the argument.\nIn this case, we can use modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent is true, then its consequent must be true.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the application of logic.\nSince premise 1 is true and premise 2 is true, we can conclude that \"Joe went to the park\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
