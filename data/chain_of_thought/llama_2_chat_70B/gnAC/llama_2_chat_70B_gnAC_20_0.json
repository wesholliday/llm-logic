In this case, we are asked to determine if the conclusion \"The apple was red\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to determine whether the conclusion follows from the premises. We can use modus ponens, a basic rule of logic that states:\n\nIf A \u2192 B and B, then A.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n* A \u2192 B (premise 1)\n* B (premise 2)\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n\n* A (answer)\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
