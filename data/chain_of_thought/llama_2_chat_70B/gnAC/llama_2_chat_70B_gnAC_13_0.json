            "content": "\nStep 1: Write down the given information in a logical format:\n\n* If the car was red, then the truck was blue (premise 1)\n* The truck was blue (premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, we are asked to determine if the conclusion \"The car was red\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to determine whether the conclusion follows. We can use modus ponens, which states that if a conditional statement is true and its antecedent is true, then its consequent must be true. In this case, we have:\n\n* If the car was red, then the truck was blue (premise 1)\n* The truck was blue (premise 2)\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the car was red.\n\nStep 4: Check for any assumptions or unstated premises. In this case, there are no obvious assumptions or unstated premises that would affect the conclusion.\n\nStep 5: Consider alternative explanations or counterexamples. For example, it's possible that the truck was blue for a reason unrelated to the car's color. However, without additional information, we cannot conclude that this is the case.\n\nStep 6: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis. Since we have determined that the conclusion logically follows from the premises using modus ponens, and there are no counterexamples or unstated premises that would affect the conclusion, we can confidently say:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
