In this case, we are asked to determine if the conclusion \"Alex finished the race\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to determine whether the conclusion follows. We can use Modus Ponens (MP) to deduce the conclusion. MP states that if \"If A then B\" is true and \"B\" is true, then \"A\" must be true. In this case, we have:\n\n* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race (premise 1 - If A then B)\n* Chris finished the race (premise 2 - B)\n\nTherefore, using MP, we can deduce that:\n\n* Alex finished the race (conclusion - A)\n\nStep 4: Check for any contradictions or inconsistencies in the argument. In this case, there are no contradictions or inconsistencies.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question based on the logical reasoning performed above.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
