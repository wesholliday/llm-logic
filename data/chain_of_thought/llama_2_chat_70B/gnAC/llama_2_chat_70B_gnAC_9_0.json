            "content": "\nStep 1: Write down the given information in a logical format:\n\n* If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt (premise 1)\n* Mark bought the blue shirt (premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion. In this case, we are asked to determine if the conclusion \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to determine whether the conclusion follows. We can use modus ponens, a basic rule of logic that states:\n\nIf A \u2192 B and B, then A\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA \u2192 B (premise 1)\nB (premise 2)\n\nTherefore, we can conclude:\n\nA (Lisa bought the red shirt)\n\nStep 4: Check for any assumptions or unstated premises that might affect the conclusion. In this case, there are no obvious assumptions or unstated premises that would impact the conclusion.\n\nStep 5: Consider alternative explanations or counterexamples that might refute the conclusion. For example, it's possible that Mark bought the blue shirt without Lisa buying the red shirt. However, given the premises, this scenario seems unlikely.\n\nStep 6: Based on the above analysis, determine whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In this case, the conclusion \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" does logically follow from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
