(C \u2192 D)\n* It's not the case that the pants must have been denim. (\u00acD)\n\nStep 2: Negate the second statement to get the contrapositive:\n\n* It's not the case that the pants must have been denim. (\u00acD) \u2192 The pants must not have been denim. (\u00acD \u2192 \u00acP)\n\nStep 3: Use modus tollens to combine the two statements:\n\n* If the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim. (C \u2192 D)\n* The pants must not have been denim. (\u00acD \u2192 \u00acP)\n\n* Therefore, the shirt was not cotton. (C \u2192 \u00acP)\n\nStep 4: Check for validity:\n\nThe argument is valid because it uses modus tollens correctly. The conclusion follows logically from the premises.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
