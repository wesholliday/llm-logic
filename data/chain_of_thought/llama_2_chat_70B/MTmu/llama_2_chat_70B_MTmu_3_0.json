It's not the case that the book must be a mystery novel (given)\n3. Therefore, the book was not written by James.\n\nThe reasoning is based on modus tollens, which states that if \"if A then B\" and \"not B\", then we can conclude \"not A\". In this case, A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book must be a mystery novel\". Since we know that the book is not a mystery novel, we can infer that it was not written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
