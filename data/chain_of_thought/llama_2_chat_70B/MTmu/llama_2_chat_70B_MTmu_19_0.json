            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball\" - This is a conditional statement, where the truth of the antecedent (Tom watching football) implies the truth of the consequent (Jen watching basketball).\n* \"It's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball\" - This statement negates the possibility that Jen must have watched basketball.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement contradicts the first statement's consequent (Jen watching basketball). If Tom watched football, then Jen must have watched basketball, but we know that it's not the case that Jen must have watched basketball. Therefore, the antecedent (Tom watching football) cannot be true.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that \"Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
