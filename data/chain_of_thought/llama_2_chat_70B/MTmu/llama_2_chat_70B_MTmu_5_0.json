However, this scenario is impossible since the second statement states that Amy did not play tennis.\n* Scenario 2: Jeff did not play basketball, which means Amy not playing tennis is not a necessary consequence. This scenario is possible since it aligns with the second statement.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\n* Since the only possible scenario that aligns with both statements is Scenario 2 (Jeff did not play basketball), we can infer that Jeff did not play basketball.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
