            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" - This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the premise (Joe going to the park) is true, then the conclusion (Lucy going to the zoo) must also be true.\n* \"It's not the case that Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" - This statement implies that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement contradicts the conclusion of the first statement. If the first statement is true, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo, but the second statement states that this is not the case.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the contradiction between the two statements, we can infer that the premise of the first statement (\"Joe went to the park\") must be false. Therefore, Joe did not go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
