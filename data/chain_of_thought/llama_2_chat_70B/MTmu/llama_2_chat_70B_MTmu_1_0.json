However, we also know that it's not the case that Sue must have been at the wedding. This means that the condition in the first statement cannot be met, and therefore, Mary cannot have been at the wedding either.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that Mary was not at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
