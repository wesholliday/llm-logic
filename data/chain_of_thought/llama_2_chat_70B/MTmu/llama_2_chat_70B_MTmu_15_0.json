If the first statement is true, then Erin must have taken a train, but the second statement states that this is not the case.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the contradiction between the two statements, we can infer that the premise of the first statement (Sam taking a plane) cannot be true. Therefore, Sam did not take a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
