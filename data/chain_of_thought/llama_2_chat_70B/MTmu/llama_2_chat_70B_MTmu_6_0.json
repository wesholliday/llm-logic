If the premise (Sue choosing pizza) is true, then the conclusion (Bob choosing pasta) must also be true.\n* \"It's not the case that Bob must have chosen pasta\" - This statement implies that Bob did not choose pasta.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe know that if Sue chose pizza, then Bob must have chosen pasta. However, we also know that Bob did not choose pasta. This means that the premise of the first statement (Sue choosing pizza) cannot be true.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
