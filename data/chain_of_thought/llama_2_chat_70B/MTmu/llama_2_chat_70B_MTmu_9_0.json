            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" - This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the premise (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the conclusion (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n* \"It's not the case that Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" - This statement negates the conclusion of the first statement, meaning that it is not necessarily true that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\nWe can see that the two statements are in a contrapositive relationship. The first statement asserts that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark must buy the blue shirt. The second statement denies the conclusion of the first statement by saying that it's not necessarily true that Mark must have bought the blue shirt.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nGiven the contrapositive relationship between the two statements, we can infer that if Mark did not buy the blue shirt (which is what the second statement asserts), then Lisa did not buy the red shirt (since the first statement implies that if Lisa buys the red shirt, then Mark must buy the blue shirt).\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
