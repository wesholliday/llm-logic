The negation of a conditional statement is equivalent to switching the order of the premises and negating the conclusion.\n3. Therefore, the argument can be rephrased as \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic.\"\n4. This revised argument is logically valid because it follows the form of a contrapositive, which is a valid form of argument.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
