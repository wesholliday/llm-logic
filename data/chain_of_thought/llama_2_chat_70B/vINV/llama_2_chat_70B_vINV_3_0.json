The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, with the premise being \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\" and the conclusion being \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\".\n2. A conditional statement is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n3. In this case, the premise is \"If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel\". This means that if the book was indeed written by James, then it is necessarily a mystery novel.\n4. The conclusion is \"If the book was not written by James, then the book is not a mystery novel\". This means that if the book was not written by James, then it is not necessarily a mystery novel.\n5. However, this does not mean that the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. It is possible that the book was not written by James and still be a mystery novel.\n6. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: No",
