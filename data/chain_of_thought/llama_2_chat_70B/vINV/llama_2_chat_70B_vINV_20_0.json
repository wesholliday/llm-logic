The negation in the premise is 'not red' which means the same as 'red' in logic.\n3. The conclusion has a double negation 'not yellow' which cancels out to become 'yellow'.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows the form of modus tollens, where if the premise is false, the conclusion must be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
