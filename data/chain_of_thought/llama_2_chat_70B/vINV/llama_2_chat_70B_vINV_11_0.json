The negation in the premise is \"not chocolate\" which means the premise is saying that the cake was not chocolate.\n3. The conclusion is also a negation, saying that the muffins were not blueberry.\n4. The argument is trying to convey that if the cake was not chocolate, then the muffins must not have been blueberry.\n5. This type of argument is known as a modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument.\n6. In a modus tollens argument, the conclusion follows logically from the premises if the premises are true.\n7. Therefore, this argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
