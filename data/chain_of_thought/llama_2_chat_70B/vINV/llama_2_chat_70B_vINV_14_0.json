The negation in the premise changes the meaning of the statement, so it becomes \"If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf was not in the den.\"\n3. This new statement is logically equivalent to the original statement, since if the bear was not in the cave, then it cannot be said that the wolf was in the den.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
