The conclusion also contains the same logical operator.\n\nStep 3: Check the validity of the argument\n\nTo determine the validity of the argument, we can use the following rule of logic:\n\nModus Tollens (MT): If A \u2192 B and not-A, then not-B.\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\nA = \"the dog was inside\"\nB = \"the cat was outside\"\nnot-A = \"the dog was not inside\"\nnot-B = \"the cat was not outside\"\n\nWe can see that the premise \"If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" is equivalent to saying \"If A, then B\". The conclusion \"If the dog was not inside, then the cat was not outside\" is equivalent to saying \"If not-A, then not-B\".\n\nTherefore, we can apply Modus Tollens (MT) to conclude that if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the form of argument is logically valid.",
