            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\nThe argument is a conditional statement with a negative premise. The premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. The conclusion draws a conclusion about what Mark did based on what Lisa did not do.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\nThis argument is a modus tollens, which is a type of deductive argument that uses a conditional statement to reach a conclusion. Modus tollens arguments have the following form: If A, then B. Not A, therefore not B.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity\nModus tollens arguments are logically valid if the premises are true. In this case, the premise is 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt'. If this premise is true, then the conclusion 'If Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt' logically follows.\n\nStep 4: Consider counterexamples\nIt's important to consider whether there are any possible scenarios where the premise is true but the conclusion is false. In this case, it's possible that Lisa bought the red shirt but Mark did not buy the blue shirt. This would make the conclusion false, which means the argument is not logically valid.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above reasoning, the argument 'If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt' is not logically valid because it's possible for the premise to be true but the conclusion to be false. Therefore, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No",
