            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, with the premise being \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\" and the conclusion being \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\".\n2. A conditional statement is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n3. In this case, the premise is \"If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad\". This means that if Ben did eat pasta, then it is certain that Kate ate salad.\n4. The conclusion is \"If Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad\". This means that if Ben did not eat pasta, then it is certain that Kate did not eat salad.\n5. Based on the premise and conclusion, we can see that the argument is logically valid. If Ben ate pasta, then Kate ate salad, and if Ben did not eat pasta, then Kate did not eat salad. In both cases, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
