The contrapositive of the premise is 'If the robot visited Jupiter, then the alien visited Mars'.\n3. The argument's conclusion is the negation of the contrapositive, which is 'If the alien did not visit Mars, then the robot did not visit Jupiter'.\n4. Since the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement, the argument's conclusion follows logically from the premise.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
