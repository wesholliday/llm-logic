            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The argument is in the form of a conditional statement, with the premise being \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" and the conclusion being \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\".\n2. A conditional statement is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n3. In this case, the premise \"If Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis\" implies that there is a direct relationship between Jeff playing basketball and Amy playing tennis. Specifically, it suggests that if Jeff played basketball, then Amy played tennis.\n4. The conclusion \"If Jeff did not play basketball, then Amy did not play tennis\" follows logically from the premise because it is the negation of the premise. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
