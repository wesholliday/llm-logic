The negation in the premise is 'not red' which means the premise is saying that the car was not red.\n3. The conclusion is also a negation, saying that the truck was not blue.\n4. If the premise is true, then the conclusion must be true as well, since the truck's color is determined by the car's color.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because if the premise is true, the conclusion must follow.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
