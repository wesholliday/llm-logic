The contrapositive of the premise is 'If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football'.\n3. The argument's conclusion can be rephrased as 'Jen did not watch basketball implies Tom did not watch football'.\n4. This implication is logically equivalent to the contrapositive of the premise.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
