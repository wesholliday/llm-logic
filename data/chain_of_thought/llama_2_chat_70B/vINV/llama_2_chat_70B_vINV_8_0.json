The negation in the conclusion is 'not' before 'awake'.\n4. When we negate a conditional statement, we invert the order of the premises and conclusion.\n5. Therefore, the argument can be rephrased as:\n\nPremise: If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake.\nConclusion: If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\n6. This form of argument is logically valid because it follows the form of a contrapositive argument, where the premise and conclusion are inverted in the negated form.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
