The argument is a conditional statement with the premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" and the conclusion \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race.\"\n2. A conditional statement is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n3. In this case, the premise \"If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race\" implies that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race as well, since the two statements are connected by the logical operator \"then.\"\n4. The conclusion \"If Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race\" follows logically from the premise, since if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris cannot have finished the race either, given the premise.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid, since the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
