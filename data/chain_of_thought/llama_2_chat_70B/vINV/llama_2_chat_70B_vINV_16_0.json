The negation of a conditional statement is equivalent to the contrapositive of the original statement.\n3. The contrapositive of \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim\" is \"If the pants were not denim, then the shirt was not cotton\".\n4. The argument's conclusion \"If the shirt was not cotton, then the pants were not denim\" is equivalent to the contrapositive of the original statement.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
