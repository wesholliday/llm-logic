            "content": "\nMy reasoning:\n\n1. The argument is a conditional statement with the premise \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\" and the conclusion \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\".\n2. A conditional statement is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n3. In this case, the premise is \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding\". This means that if Mary was indeed at the wedding, then it is necessarily true that Sue was also at the wedding.\n4. The conclusion of the argument is \"If Mary was not at the wedding, then Sue was not at the wedding\". This conclusion follows logically from the premise because if Mary was not at the wedding, then it is impossible for Sue to have been at the wedding, given the premise that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue was at the wedding.\n5. Therefore, the argument is logically valid because its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
