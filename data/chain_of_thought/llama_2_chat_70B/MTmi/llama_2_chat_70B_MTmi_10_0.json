If the dog is inside, then the cat must be outside.\n* The second statement introduces uncertainty about the cat's location.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions\n\nBased on the given information, we cannot infer with certainty that the dog was not inside. The first statement suggests that if the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside, but the second statement introduces doubt about the cat's location. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: No",
