However, the second statement indicates that it's possible that Chris did not finish the race. This means that there are two possibilities:\n\n1. Alex finished the race, and Chris finished the race (as per the first statement).\n2. Alex did not finish the race, and Chris might not have finished the race (as per the second statement).\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that if Alex finished the race, then Chris must have finished the race. However, since it's possible that Chris did not finish the race, we cannot conclusively say that Alex did not finish the race. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
