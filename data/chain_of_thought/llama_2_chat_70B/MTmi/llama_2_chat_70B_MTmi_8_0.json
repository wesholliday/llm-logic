Specifically, if the vampire is awake, then the mummy must be awake.\n\nPremise 2 suggests that the mummy's state is uncertain, and it might not have been awake.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the premises\n\nGiven the relationship between the premises, we can infer that if the mummy might not have been awake (premise 2), then the vampire might not have been awake either (since the vampire's state determines the mummy's state).\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is:\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
