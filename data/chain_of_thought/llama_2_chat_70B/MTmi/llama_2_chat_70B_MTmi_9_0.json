            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark must have bought the blue shirt\" - This is a conditional statement, meaning that if the premise (Lisa buying the red shirt) is true, then the conclusion (Mark buying the blue shirt) must also be true.\n* \"Mark might not have bought the blue shirt\" - This statement indicates that it's possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt, but it doesn't necessarily mean that he didn't buy it.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\nWe can see that the two statements are related to each other because they both involve the purchase of shirts by Lisa and Mark. The first statement implies that if Lisa bought a red shirt, then Mark must have bought a blue shirt. The second statement suggests that Mark might not have bought a blue shirt.\n\nStep 3: Draw conclusions based on the analysis\n\nFrom the first statement, we can conclude that if Lisa bought a red shirt, then Mark must have bought a blue shirt. However, the second statement indicates that it's possible that Mark didn't buy a blue shirt. This means that the conclusion from the first statement might not be true, and therefore, we cannot infer that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: No",
