            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo\" - This is a conditional statement, where the truth of the conclusion (Lucy going to the zoo) is dependent on the premise (Joe going to the park).\n* \"Lucy might not have gone to the zoo\" - This statement indicates that it's possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\nThe first statement implies that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. The second statement suggests that Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. If we combine these two statements, we can infer that if Joe went to the park, then it's possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that \"Joe did not go to the park\" because if he had gone to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo, but since it's possible that Lucy didn't go to the zoo, it means that Joe didn't go to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
