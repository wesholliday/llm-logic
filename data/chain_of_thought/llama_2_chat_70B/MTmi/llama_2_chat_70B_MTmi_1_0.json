            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been at the wedding\" - This is a conditional statement, where the presence of Mary at the wedding implies the presence of Sue.\n* \"Sue might not have been at the wedding\" - This statement indicates that Sue's presence at the wedding is uncertain.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\n* The first statement implies that if Mary was at the wedding, then Sue must have been there too.\n* The second statement suggests that Sue's presence is not guaranteed, but it doesn't necessarily mean she wasn't there.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nBased on the two statements, we cannot infer with certainty whether Mary was or was not at the wedding. The first statement suggests that if Mary was there, then Sue must have been there too, but the second statement implies that Sue's presence is uncertain. Therefore, we cannot conclude whether Mary was at the wedding or not.\n\nAnswer: No",
