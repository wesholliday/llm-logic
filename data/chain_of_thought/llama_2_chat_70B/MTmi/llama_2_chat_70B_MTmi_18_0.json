            "content": "\nStep 1: Write down the given information in a clear and concise way.\n\n* If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal.\n* The truck might not have been metal.\n\nStep 2: Assess the relationship between the two premises.\n\nThe first premise states that if the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal. This means that if the doll was not plastic, then the truck does not have to be metal.\n\nThe second premise states that the truck might not have been metal. This means that it is possible that the truck was not metal, but it is also possible that it was metal.\n\nStep 3: Consider the possibility of the doll being plastic.\n\nIf the doll was plastic, then according to the first premise, the truck must have been metal. However, since the second premise states that the truck might not have been metal, it is possible that the doll was not plastic.\n\nStep 4: Consider the possibility of the doll not being plastic.\n\nIf the doll was not plastic, then the first premise does not apply, and the truck could still be metal or not metal. This means that the second premise is consistent with the doll not being plastic.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nBased on the information provided, it is possible that the doll was not plastic, and it is also possible that the truck was not metal. Therefore, we cannot infer 'The doll was not plastic' with certainty.\n\nAnswer: No",
