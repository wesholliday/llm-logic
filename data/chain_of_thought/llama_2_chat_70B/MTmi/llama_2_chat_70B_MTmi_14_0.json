(B)\n\nStep 3: If the bear was in the cave, then according to the first statement, the wolf must have been in the den. (B \u2192 W)\n\nStep 4: But we know that the wolf might not have been in the den. (\u00acW)\n\nStep 5: This means that our assumption in step 2 (B) leads to a contradiction in step 4. Therefore, we must conclude that the bear was not in the cave. (\u00acB)\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
