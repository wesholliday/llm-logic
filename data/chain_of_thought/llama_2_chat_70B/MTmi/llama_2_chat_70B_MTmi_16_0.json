There are no obvious logical fallacies or inconsistencies in this statement.\n\nStep 3: Analyze the second statement to identify any logical fallacies or inconsistencies.\n\nThe second statement is a possibility statement, and it suggests that the pants might not have been denim. This statement does not contain any obvious logical fallacies or inconsistencies either.\n\nStep 4: Consider how the two statements relate to each other.\n\nIf the shirt was cotton, then the pants must have been denim (according to the first statement). However, the second statement suggests that the pants might not have been denim. This implies that the conclusion drawn from the first statement is uncertain or false.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can infer that the shirt was not cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
