Premise 2 suggests that Jen might not have watched basketball.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the relationship\n\nIf Premise 1 is true and Premise 2 is true, then we can infer that Tom did not watch football. This is because if Tom had watched football, then according to Premise 1, Jen would have watched basketball, but Premise 2 states that Jen might not have watched basketball. Therefore, the possibility that Tom watched football is negated.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
