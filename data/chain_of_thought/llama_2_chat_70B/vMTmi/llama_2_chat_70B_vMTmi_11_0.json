This means that if the cake was chocolate, we can conclude that the muffins were blueberry.\n2. The second premise states that the muffins might not have been blueberry. This means that it's possible that the muffins were not blueberry, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they weren't blueberry.\n3. The conclusion is that the cake was not chocolate. This is based on the fact that if the cake was chocolate, then the muffins must have been blueberry, and since it's possible that the muffins weren't blueberry, it means that the cake couldn't have been chocolate.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the argument is logically valid because it follows a logical pattern of if-then statements. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
