This means that if the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf might not have been in the den.\n2. The second premise states that the wolf might not have been in the den. This means that it is possible that the wolf was not in the den, but it does not necessarily mean that the wolf was not in the den.\n3. The conclusion states that the bear was not in the cave. This follows logically from the first premise and second premise. If the bear was not in the cave, then the wolf might not have been in the den, which means that the bear was not in the cave.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
