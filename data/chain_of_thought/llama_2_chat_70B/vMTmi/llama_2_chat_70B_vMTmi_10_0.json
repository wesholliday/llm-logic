This means that if the dog was inside, we can conclude that the cat was not inside.\n2. The second premise states that the cat might not have been outside. This means that it's possible that the cat was inside.\n3. The conclusion is that the dog was not inside. This follows logically from the first premise and second premise. If the dog was inside, then the cat must have been outside, but since the cat might not have been outside, it's possible that the dog was not inside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
