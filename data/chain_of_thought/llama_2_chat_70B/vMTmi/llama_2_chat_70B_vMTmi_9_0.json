This means that if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n2. The second premise states that Mark might not have bought the blue shirt. This means that it is possible that Mark did not buy the blue shirt.\n3. The conclusion states that Lisa did not buy the red shirt. This follows logically from the first two premises, as if Lisa did not buy the red shirt, then Mark did not buy the blue shirt, and since Mark might not have bought the blue shirt, it is possible that Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
