This means that if the premise is true, then the conclusion that Erin might not have taken a train is false.\n2. The second premise states that Erin might not have taken a train. This means that it's possible that Erin did not take a train, but it doesn't necessarily mean that she didn't take a train.\n3. The conclusion states that Sam did not take a plane. This is based on the first premise and the second premise. If Sam took a plane, then Erin must have taken a train, but since Erin might not have taken a train, it's possible that Sam didn't take a plane.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the argument is logically valid because if the premises are true, then the conclusion follows necessarily.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
