This means that if Sue chose pizza, then it is impossible for Bob to have chosen anything else other than pasta.\n2. The second premise states that Bob might not have chosen pasta. This means that it is possible that Bob did not choose pasta, and therefore, it is possible that the first premise is false.\n3. The conclusion states that Sue did not choose pizza. This follows logically from the second premise, since if Bob might not have chosen pasta, then it is possible that Sue did not choose pizza.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid because it follows a logical pattern of reasoning. The first premise establishes a necessary condition for Bob's choice, and the second premise introduces a possibility that the necessary condition might not hold. The conclusion logically follows from this possibility, making the argument valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
