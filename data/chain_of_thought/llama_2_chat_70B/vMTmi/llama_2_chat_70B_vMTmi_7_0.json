This means that if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris did not finish the race either.\n2. The second premise states that Chris might not have finished the race. This means that there is a possibility that Chris did not finish the race.\n3. The conclusion states that Alex did not finish the race. This follows logically from the first two premises, as if Alex did not finish the race, then Chris must have also not finished the race, which is consistent with the second premise.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
