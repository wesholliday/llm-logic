The formula for modus tollens is:\n\n\u00acC \u2192 \u00acA\n\nWhere C is the conclusion and A is the premise that leads to the conclusion. In this case, the conclusion is \"The alien did not visit Mars\" (C), and the premise that leads to the conclusion is \"The robot might not have visited Jupiter\" (\u00acA). The first premise \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot must have visited Jupiter\" is used to infer the negation of the conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument for validity\n\nTo evaluate the argument for validity, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises. In modus tollens, the conclusion follows logically if the premises are true.\n\nPremise 1 is a conditional statement, and it is not necessarily true. However, for the sake of this argument, let's assume that it is true.\n\nPremise 2 states that the robot might not have visited Jupiter. This means that the negation of the conclusion (\u00acC) is possible.\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer \u00acC (the alien did not visit Mars) from \u00acA (the robot might not have visited Jupiter) and the conditional statement in Premise 1.\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
