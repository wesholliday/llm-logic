This means that the vampire's awakeness is dependent on the mummy's awakeness.\n2. The second premise states that the mummy might not have been awake. This means that there is a possibility that the mummy was not awake.\n3. The conclusion states that the vampire was not awake. This is logically deduced from the first two premises. If the mummy might not have been awake, and the vampire's awakeness is dependent on the mummy's awakeness, then it is possible that the vampire was not awake.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
