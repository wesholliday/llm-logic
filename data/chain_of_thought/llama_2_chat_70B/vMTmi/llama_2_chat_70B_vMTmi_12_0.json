            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument is structured as follows:\n\nPremise 1: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\nPremise 2: Lucy might not have gone to the zoo.\nConclusion: Joe did not go to the park.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\n\nThis argument is a conditional argument, specifically a modus tollens argument. Modus tollens is a form of argument that uses the contrapositive of a conditional statement to reach a conclusion. The formula for modus tollens is:\n\n\u00acQ \u2192 \u00acP\nP\n\u2234 \u00acQ\n\nIn this case, the argument can be translated into symbolic form as follows:\n\n\u00acL \u2192 \u00acJ\nJ\n\u2234 \u00acL\n\nWhere L represents \"Lucy went to the zoo\" and J represents \"Joe went to the park\".\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument for logical validity\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises. In other words, is it impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true?\n\nLet's assume that the first premise is true: If Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo. This means that if Joe did go to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nNow, consider the second premise: Lucy might not have gone to the zoo. This means that it's possible that Lucy did not go to the zoo.\n\nIf we combine these two premises, we can see that it's possible that Joe went to the park and Lucy did not go to the zoo. In this case, the conclusion \"Joe did not go to the park\" would be false.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid because the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises. It's possible for the conclusion to be false even if the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: No",
