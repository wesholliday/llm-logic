This means that if the doll was plastic, we can conclude that the truck was metal.\n2. The second premise states that the truck might not have been metal. This means that it's possible that the truck was not metal.\n3. The conclusion is that the doll was not plastic. This is based on the first premise and the second premise. If the doll was plastic, then the truck must have been metal, but since the truck might not have been metal, it's possible that the doll was not plastic.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the argument is logically valid because it follows a logical pattern and the conclusion follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
