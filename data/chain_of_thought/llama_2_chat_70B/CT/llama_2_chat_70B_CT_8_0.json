            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the statement\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion and negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the contrapositive is logically equivalent to the original statement\nThe contrapositive we derived is not logically equivalent to the original statement. The original statement asserts that the vampire's awakeness implies the mummy's awakeness, whereas the contrapositive asserts that the mummy's sleepiness implies the vampire's sleepiness. These two statements are not logically equivalent because the first one talks about implication, while the second one talks about equivalence.\n\nStep 4: Determine whether we can infer the desired statement\nSince the contrapositive is not logically equivalent to the original statement, we cannot infer the desired statement \"If the mummy was not awake, then the vampire was not awake\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
