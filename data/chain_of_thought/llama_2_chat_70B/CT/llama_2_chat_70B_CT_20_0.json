The contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the contrapositive\nIn this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the contrapositive implies the desired conclusion\nThe desired conclusion is \"If the banana was not yellow, then the apple was not red.\" Since the contrapositive we derived implies this conclusion, the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
