            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B\". It means that the truth of B (the robot visited Jupiter) is dependent on the truth of A (the alien visited Mars).\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the statement\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion and negating both. In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If not B, then not A\".\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the contrapositive\nThe contrapositive of the given statement is \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original statement.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the contrapositive implies the desired conclusion\nThe desired conclusion is \"If the robot did not visit Jupiter, then the alien did not visit Mars.\" Since the contrapositive we derived in step 3 is logically equivalent to the original statement, it follows that the desired conclusion is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
