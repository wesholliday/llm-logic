In other words, we need to check if the negated statement has the same meaning as the original statement.\n\nThe negated statement \"If the griffin was not in the forest, then the unicorn was not in the forest\" means that if the griffin is not in the forest, then the unicorn is also not in the forest. This is the same meaning as the original statement \"If the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn was in the forest.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the unicorn was not in the forest, then the griffin was not in the forest\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
