            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" It means that the truth of B (Mark bought the blue shirt) is dependent on the truth of A (Lisa bought the red shirt).\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the given statement\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, and negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive of \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" would be \"If Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the contrapositive\nSince we know that the original statement is true, we can infer that its contrapositive is also true. Therefore, if Mark did not buy the blue shirt, then Lisa did not buy the red shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
