The premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies that the doll's material (plastic) is linked to the truck's material (metal).\n2. If we negate the premise, we get \"If the doll was not plastic, then the truck was not metal.\"\n3. This negated premise still maintains the same logical relationship between the doll's material and the truck's material.\n4. Therefore, we can infer \"If the truck was not metal, then the doll was not plastic\" from the original premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
