The original statement implies that the presence of the bear in the cave implies the presence of the wolf in the den, whereas the negated statement implies that the absence of the bear in the cave implies the absence of the wolf in the den. These are not the same statements.\n\nStep 6: Determine if we can infer the converse\nSince the negated statement is not equivalent to the original statement, we cannot infer the converse.\n\nAnswer: No",
