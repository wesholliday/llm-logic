            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" It means that if Tom watched football, then Jen watched basketball.\n\nStep 2: Identify the parts of the statement\nA = Tom watching football\nB = Jen watching basketball\n\nStep 3: Negate the statement\nTo negate the statement, we need to switch the parts. So, the negated statement would be:\n\n\"If Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball.\"\n\nStep 4: Check if the negated statement is true\nAssuming the original statement is true, we can infer that if Tom did not watch football, then Jen did not watch basketball. This means that the negated statement is also true.\n\nStep 5: Infer the conclusion\nSince we have shown that the negated statement is true, we can infer that \"If Jen did not watch basketball, then Tom did not watch football.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
