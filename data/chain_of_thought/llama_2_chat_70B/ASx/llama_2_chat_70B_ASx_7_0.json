In this case, the new condition does not provide any new information that would affect the snurpling of the goom. The goom will still be snurpled as long as the tizzer is on, regardless of whether the plink light is out or not.\n\nStep 4: Answer\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If the tizzer is on and the plink light is out, then the goom is snurpled\" from the given statement \"If the tizzer is on, then the goom is snurpled.\"",
