The klank is hooped\n2. The wuggy will zink\n\nStep 3: Analyze the relationship between the parts\nThe statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship between the two parts. That is, if the klank is hooped, then the wuggy will zink.\n\nStep 4: Consider the additional information\nThe question asks if we can infer \"If the klank is hooped and the wuggy is out of zloat, then the wuggy will zink?\"\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the inference\nThe additional information \"and the wuggy is out of zloat\" does not affect the cause-and-effect relationship between the klank being hooped and the wuggy zinking. Therefore, we can still infer that if the klank is hooped and the wuggy is out of zloat, then the wuggy will zink.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
