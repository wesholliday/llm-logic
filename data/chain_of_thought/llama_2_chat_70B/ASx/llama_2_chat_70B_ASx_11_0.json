This does not affect the truth of the original statement, but it may provide additional context.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether the conclusion \"If the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will zoon\" can be logically inferred from the given statement and additional information.\n\nSince the original statement only mentions the zibble being zapped, it does not explicitly address the quib's state. However, the additional information about the quib being squinked does not contradict the original statement. Therefore, we can infer that if the zibble is zapped and the quib is squinked, then the glorp will still zoon.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
