Specifically, if the frizzle is dinked, then the zarp will splunk.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the additional premise\n\"If the sklonk is grooped\"\nThis premise introduces a new variable, the sklonk, and its relationship to the zarp. It does not provide any information about the frizzle.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the conclusion follows logically\nTo infer the conclusion \"If the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped, then the zarp will splunk,\" we need to consider the relationships between the frizzle, sklonk, and zarp. The given statement only establishes a relationship between the frizzle and zarp. The additional premise does not provide enough information to logically conclude that the zarp will splunk when both the frizzle is dinked and the sklonk is grooped.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\nAnswer: No",
