The flooping of the snarp does not affect the fluggedness of the fribble; it only provides more information about the state of the snarp.\n\nStep 4: Formulate a response.\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If the fribble is in the snarp and the snarp is flooping, then it is flugged\" from the given statement and additional premise.",
