Premise 2 simply states that the shank was nugged.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether we can infer the conclusion from the premises.\n\nSince Premise 1 guarantees that if the shank was plooked, it would be nugged, and Premise 2 confirms that the shank was indeed nugged, we can logically conclude that the shank must have been plooked before it was nugged.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
