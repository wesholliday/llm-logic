Modus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to conclude that if A implies B, and B is true, then A must be true. In this case, A is \"the wug was sproinged\" and B is \"the wug was garpled\".\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the application of modus ponens, we can conclude that the wug was indeed sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
