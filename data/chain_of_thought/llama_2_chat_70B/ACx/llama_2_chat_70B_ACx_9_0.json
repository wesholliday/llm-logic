In other words, plinking implies varnishing.\n* \"The twonk was varnished\" - This statement simply states that the twonk was varnished.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the first statement implies that plinking leads to varnishing, while the second statement states that the twonk was varnished.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nSince we know that the twonk was varnished (from the second statement), and we also know that if the twonk was plinked, then it must have been varnished (from the first statement), we can logically infer that the twonk was indeed plinked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
