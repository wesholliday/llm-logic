If the premise \"the smonk was vreebled\" is true, then the conclusion \"the smonk plagged\" must also be true.\n* \"The smonk plagged\" - This is a statement that the smonk plagged.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement \"The smonk plagged\" is the conclusion of the first statement \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged\". This means that if we know that the smonk plagged, we can infer that the smonk was vreebled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis in step 2, we can conclude that if the smonk plagged, then the smonk was vreebled. Therefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
