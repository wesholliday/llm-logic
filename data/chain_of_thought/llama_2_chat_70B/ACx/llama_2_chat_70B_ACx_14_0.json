If the antecedent (the clug was fleeked) is true, then the consequent (the clug snugged) must also be true.\n* \"The clug snugged\" - This is a declarative sentence stating that the clug snugged.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement (\"The clug snugged\") is the consequent of the first statement (\"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\"). This means that if the antecedent of the first statement is true, then the second statement must also be true.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince we know that the clug snugged (second statement), we can infer that the antecedent of the first statement (\"If the clug was fleeked\") must also be true. Therefore, we can conclude that the clug was fleeked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
