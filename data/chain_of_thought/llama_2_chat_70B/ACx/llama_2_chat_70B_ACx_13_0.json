If the premise \"the glip was slogged\" is true, then the conclusion \"the glip was tragged\" must also be true.\n* \"The glip was tragged\" - This is a statement of fact.\n\nStep 2: Apply modus ponens\n\nModus ponens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce a conclusion from a conditional statement and a premise. The formula for modus ponens is:\n\n(If A then B) AND A\n=====================\nB\n\nIn this case, we have:\n\n* A = \"the glip was slogged\"\n* B = \"the glip was tragged\"\n\nWe can apply modus ponens by replacing A and B with their corresponding values:\n\n(If the glip was slogged then the glip was tragged) AND the glip was tragged\n====================================================================\nthe glip was slogged\n\nStep 3: Conclude\n\nSince we have applied modus ponens correctly, we can deduce that \"the glip was slogged\" is true. Therefore, our answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
