            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled\" - This is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and the consequent is \"the sprocket was daggled\".\n* \"The sprocket was daggled\" - This is a declarative sentence stating that the sprocket was indeed daggled.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe know that if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled (from the first statement). Now, we are also given that the sprocket was daggled (second statement). This means that the condition for the antecedent of the first statement to be true has been met.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the sprocket was indeed cranked, since the condition for the antecedent of the first statement to be true has been met and the consequent of the first statement (the sprocket was daggled) is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
