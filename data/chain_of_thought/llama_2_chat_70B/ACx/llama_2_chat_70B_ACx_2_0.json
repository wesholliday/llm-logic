In other words, if the wug was flooped, then it bimmed the zoint. Since we know that the wug did bim the zoint, we can infer that the wug must have been flooped beforehand.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that \"The wug was flooped\" can be inferred from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
