This means that smoogling is a consequence of fraggling.\n\nPremise 2 simply states that the zinger was smoogled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the relationship between the premises.\n\nSince premise 2 states that the zinger was smoogled, and premise 1 states that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled, we can conclude that the zinger was fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
