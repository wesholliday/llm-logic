If the flob was skizzled, then it necessarily movated.\n* \"The flob movated\" - This is a statement of fact. The flob did movate.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe know that if the flob was skizzled, then it movated. We also know that the flob did movate. Therefore, we can conclude that the flob was indeed skizzled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that \"The flob was skizzled\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
