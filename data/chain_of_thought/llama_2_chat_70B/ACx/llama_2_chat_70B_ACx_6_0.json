If the premise \"the grommet was sploffed\" is true, then the conclusion \"the grommet plopped the frink\" must also be true.\n* \"The grommet plopped the frink\" - This is a statement of fact.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement \"The grommet plopped the frink\" is the conclusion of the first statement \"If the grommet was sploffed, then the grommet plopped the frink\". In other words, if we know that the grommet plopped the frink, we can infer that the grommet must have been sploffed.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can indeed infer that \"The grommet was sploffed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
