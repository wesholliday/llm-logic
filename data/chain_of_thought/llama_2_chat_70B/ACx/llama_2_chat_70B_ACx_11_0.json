If the antecedent (flug was blummed) is true, then the consequent (flug was zimmed) must also be true.\n* \"The flug was zimmed\" - This is a declarative sentence stating that the flug was indeed zimmed.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement (\"The flug was zimmed\") is the consequent of the first statement (\"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\"). This means that if we know the flug was zimmed, we can infer that it must have been blummed first.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can indeed infer \"The flug was blummed\" from the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
