However, we know that the flob did not movate, from the second statement. This means that the flob cannot have been skizzled, as its skizzling would have resulted in movement.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer that \"The flob was not skizzled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
