If the clug was fleeked, then it must have snugged.\n* \"The clug did not snugged\" - This statement negates the idea that the clug snugged.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\n* Since the clug did not snug, we can conclude that the premise of the conditional statement (\"If the clug was fleeked\") is false. In other words, the clug was not fleeked.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that \"The clug was not fleeked.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
