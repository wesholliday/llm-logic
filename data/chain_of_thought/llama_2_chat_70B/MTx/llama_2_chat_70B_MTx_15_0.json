In other words, vroombing implies spening.\n* \"The dreb was not spened\" means that the dreb was not spened.\n\nStep 2: Apply Modus Tollens\n\nModus tollens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the negation of the antecedent (first part) of a conditional statement from the negation of the consequent (second part). In this case, we have:\n\n* Antecedent: The dreb was vroombed\n* Consequent: The dreb was spened\n* Negation of the consequent: The dreb was not spened\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can deduce the negation of the antecedent:\n\n* The dreb was not vroombed\n\nStep 3: Answer\n\nAnswer: Yes",
