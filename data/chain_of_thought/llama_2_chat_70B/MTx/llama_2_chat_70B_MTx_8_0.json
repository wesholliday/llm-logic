If the sprocket was not daggled, then it means that the condition for daggling (cranking) did not occur.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nBased on the relationship between cranking and daggling, we can infer that if the sprocket was not daggled, then it was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
