If the premise \"the smonk was vreebled\" is true, then the conclusion \"the smonk plagged\" must also be true.\n* \"The smonk did not plagged\" - This is a statement that negates the conclusion of the first statement.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement contradicts the conclusion of the first statement. If the smonk was vreebled, then it should have plagged, but it did not. This means that the premise of the first statement, \"the smonk was vreebled,\" cannot be true.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that \"The smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
