            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"If the flug was blummed, then the flug was zimmed\" - This statement implies that blumming and zimming are related, where blumming implies zimming.\n* \"The flug was not zimmed\" - This statement states that the flug was not zimmed.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between blumming and zimming\n\nFrom the first statement, we can infer that blumming implies zimming. In other words, if something is blummed, then it must be zimmed.\n\nStep 3: Apply the information to the conclusion\n\nWe want to infer whether the flug was not blummed. Let's assume that the flug was blummed. If the flug was blummed, then according to the first statement, it must be zimmed. However, we know from the second statement that the flug was not zimmed. This creates a contradiction, as we have assumed that the flug was blummed, which implies it should be zimmed, but we know it's not zimmed.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that if the flug was not zimmed, then it must not have been blummed. In other words, the negation of zimming (not zimmed) implies the negation of blumming (not blummed).\n\nAnswer: Yes",
