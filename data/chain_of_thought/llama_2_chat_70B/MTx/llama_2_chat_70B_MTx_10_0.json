            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statements\n\n* \"If the wug was sproinged, then it was garpled\" - This statement implies that sproinging necessarily leads to garpling. In other words, if something is sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n* \"The wug was not garpled\" - This statement asserts that the wug was not in a state of being garpled.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the statements\n\nWe can see that the first statement describes a causal relationship between sproinging and garpling, while the second statement denies the existence of garpling in the case of the wug.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nGiven that the wug was not garpled, and sproinging necessarily leads to garpling, we can infer that the wug was not sproinged. In other words, if the wug had been sproinged, it would have been garpled, but since it was not garpled, it must not have been sproinged.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
