(Premise 1)\n* The smip did not lup the zoint. (Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two premises.\n\n* Premise 1 states that if the smip was shripped, then it lupped the zoint. This means that if the smip did not lup the zoint, then it was not shripped.\n* Premise 2 states that the smip did not lup the zoint. This means that the smip was not shripped, since if it were shripped, it would have lupped the zoint according to Premise 1.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\n* Since Premise 2 states that the smip did not lup the zoint, and Premise 1 states that if the smip was shripped, then it would have lupped the zoint, we can infer that the smip was not shripped.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
