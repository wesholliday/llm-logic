The statement \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" implies that there is a conditional relationship between Sam's action and Erin's action.\n2. The statement \"Also, Erin took a train\" provides additional information that Erin did indeed take a train.\n3. Using modus ponens, we can conclude that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the premises are \"If Sam took a plane, then Erin took a train\" and \"Erin took a train.\"\n4. Therefore, we can infer that Sam took a plane.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
