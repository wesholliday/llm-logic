The statement \"if the dog was inside, then the cat was outside\" implies that the dog and cat cannot be inside at the same time.\n2. We know that the cat was outside, so if the dog was also outside, then the cat would not have been outside (since they can't both be outside at the same time).\n3. Therefore, the only possibility is that the dog was inside and the cat was outside.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
