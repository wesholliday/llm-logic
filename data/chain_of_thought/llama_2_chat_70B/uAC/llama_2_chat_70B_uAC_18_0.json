The statement \"Also, the truck was metal\" provides additional information that the truck is indeed metal.\n3. Using modus ponens, we can conclude that if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true. In this case, the conclusion is \"the doll was plastic.\"\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can infer that the doll was plastic.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
