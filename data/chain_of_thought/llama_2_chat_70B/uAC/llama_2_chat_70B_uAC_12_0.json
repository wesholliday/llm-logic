However, we are not given any information about Joe's whereabouts, only Lucy's. Therefore, we cannot infer that Joe went to the park based on the given information.\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer\n\nSince we cannot logically deduce that Joe went to the park using the given information, the answer is no.\n\nAnswer: No",
