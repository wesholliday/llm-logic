In other words, if something has been blummed, then it must have also been zimmed.\n\nStep 3: Apply the given information to the conclusion\n\n* Since we know that the flug was not blummed, we can conclude that it did not undergo zimming either, because zimming is only possible if something has been blummed first.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
