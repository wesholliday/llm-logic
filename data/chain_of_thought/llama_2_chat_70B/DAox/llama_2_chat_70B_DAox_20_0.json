The first statement simply states that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion\n\nTo infer the conclusion, we need to use modus tollens, which is a form of logical reasoning that involves denying the consequent (surning) to conclude that the antecedent (bluttering) did not occur.\n\nSo, from the two given statements, we can infer that since the fleeg was not bluttered, it did not surn.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
