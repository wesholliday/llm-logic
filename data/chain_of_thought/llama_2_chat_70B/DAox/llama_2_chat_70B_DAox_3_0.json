The first statement negates the hypothesis, saying that the splat was not morphed.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nSince the hypothesis of the second statement is negated by the first statement, we can conclude that the conclusion of the second statement does not hold true. In other words, since the splat was not morphed, it did not quack.\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"The splat did not quank\" from the given statements.",
