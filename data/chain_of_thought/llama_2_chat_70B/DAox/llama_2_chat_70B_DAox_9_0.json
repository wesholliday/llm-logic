In this case, we have:\n\n* Premise: If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished\n* Negation of the premise: The twonk was not plinked (given)\n* Conclusion: The twonk was not varnished\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer the negation of the conclusion (the twonk was not varnished) given the negation of the premise (the twonk was not plinked).\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
