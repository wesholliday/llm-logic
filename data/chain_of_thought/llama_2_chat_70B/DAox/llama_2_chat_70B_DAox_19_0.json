The first statement states that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis\n\nSince the smonk was not vreebled, it means that the hypothesis of the second statement (\"If the smonk was vreebled\") is false. Therefore, we can conclude that the conclusion of the second statement (\"the smonk plagged\") is also false.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"The smonk was not plagged\" from the given statements.",
