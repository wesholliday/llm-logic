Premise 2 establishes a conditional relationship between fraggling and smoogling, stating that if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the premises\n\nSince the zinger was not fraggled (premise 1), it is not possible for the zinger to have been smoogled (by modus tollens). Therefore, we can infer that the zinger was not smoogled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
