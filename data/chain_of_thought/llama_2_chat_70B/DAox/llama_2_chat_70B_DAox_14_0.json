The first statement states that the clug was not fleeked.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the relationship\n\nSince the clug was not fleeked, we can conclude that it did not have the property of being snugged, because if it had been fleeked, it would have been snugged according to the second statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
