In other words, if something is sproinged, then it must be garpled.\n\nStep 3: Use modus tollens to draw a conclusion\n\n* Modus tollens is a logical rule that allows us to deduce the negation of the consequent (garpling) from the negation of the antecedent (sproinging) and the conditional statement (if sproinged, then garpled).\n* In this case, we know that the wug was not sproinged. Therefore, using modus tollens, we can deduce that the wug was not garpled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
