Premise 2 establishes a conditional relationship between cranking the sprocket and the sprocket being daggled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the premises\n\nSince the sprocket was not cranked (premise 1), it is not possible for the sprocket to be daggled (conclusion). This is because premise 2 states that if the sprocket was cranked, then it would be daggled. Since the sprocket was not cranked, it cannot be daggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
