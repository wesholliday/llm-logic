We need to determine whether the conclusion \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal\" follows logically from the premise.\n\nIf we assume that the premise is true, then it means that if we ate a meal, we did not eat a large meal. This implies that eating a meal and eating a large meal are mutually exclusive events.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"If I ate a large meal, then I did not eat a meal.\" This statement is saying that if we ate a large meal, then we did not eat any meal (not even a small one).\n\nBased on the premise, it seems reasonable to conclude that if we ate a large meal, then we did not eat a meal. This conclusion follows logically from the premise because if we ate a large meal, then we cannot have eaten any other meal (including a small one).\n\nStep 5: Determine the validity of the argument\n\nSince the conclusion follows logically from the premise, and the premise is assumed to be true, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
