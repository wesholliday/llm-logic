In other words, we need to see if it's impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premise is true.\n\nLet's assume that the premise is true: \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\" If this is true, then it means that whenever it's raining, it's not raining hard.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining.\" This statement says that if it's raining hard, then it's not raining at all. But this doesn't necessarily follow from the premise. It's possible for it to be raining hard and still be raining. In fact, this is exactly what the premise states - that it's raining, but not raining hard.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, and the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
