            "content": "\nStep 1: Identify the argument structure\nThe argument has the following structure:\n\nPremise: If A (directions were provided), then B (they were not explained clearly)\nConclusion: If C (directions were explained clearly), then not A (directions were not provided)\n\nStep 2: Evaluate the premise\nThe premise states that if directions were provided, then they were not explained clearly. This implies a negative relationship between providing directions and explaining them clearly. In other words, if directions are provided, it means they were not explained clearly.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that if directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided. This is logically equivalent to saying that if A (directions were provided), then not C (directions were explained clearly).\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument\nBy examining the premise and conclusion, we can see that the argument is structured as a modus tollens, which is a valid form of argument. Modus tollens involves denying the consequent (in this case, \"directions were not provided\") to conclude the opposite of the antecedent (in this case, \"directions were explained clearly\").\n\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
