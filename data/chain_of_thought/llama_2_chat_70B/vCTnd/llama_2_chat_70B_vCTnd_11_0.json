            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement with two parts:\n\nPremise: If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables.\nConclusion: If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\nThis is an example of a contrapositive argument, where the conclusion is the negation of the premise.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity\nA contrapositive argument is logically valid if and only if the original conditional statement is true. In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must be true, and if the conclusion is false, then the premise must be false.\n\nStep 4: Apply the rule\nIn this case, the premise \"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\" implies that if the speaker went to the store, they did not buy vegetables. This means that the conclusion \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\" logically follows.\n\nStep 5: Confirm the answer\nTherefore, the argument is logically valid, and the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
