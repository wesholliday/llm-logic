This means that the contrapositive of the premise is also true: \"If Jane did not study long, then she studied.\"\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: \"If Jane studied long, then she did not study.\" This is a negation of the contrapositive we just derived, which is \"If Jane did not study long, then she studied.\"\n\nSince the premise is true and the conclusion is a negation of the contrapositive, the argument is logically valid.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
