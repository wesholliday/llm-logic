            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement with a negation in the consequent. The premise is \"If Alex exercised, then he did not exercise much.\" The conclusion is \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the logical fallacy\n\nThe argument is an example of the logical fallacy known as denying the antecedent. In this fallacy, the conclusion is reached by denying the antecedent of the premise, rather than addressing the consequent.\n\nStep 3: Explain why it's a fallacy\n\nThe argument is flawed because it assumes that if Alex exercised, then he must have exercised much. However, this is not necessarily true. Alex could have exercised a little bit without exercising much. Therefore, the conclusion \"If Alex exercised much, then he did not exercise\" does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: No, the argument is not logically valid.",
