            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional statement with two parts:\n\nPremise: If the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly.\nConclusion: If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\n\nThis argument is a type of logical fallacy known as a \"contrapositive\" argument. A contrapositive argument is a type of argument where the conclusion is the negation of the premise, and the premise is a conditional statement with the antecedent (if-clause) being the opposite of the consequent (then-clause).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument\n\nTo determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the negation of the premise (i.e., \"it was cleaned\") leads to a logical contradiction with the conclusion (i.e., \"it was not cleaned\").\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument\n\nThe premise states that if the room was cleaned, then it was not cleaned thoroughly. This means that if we assume the room was cleaned, we can deduce that it was not cleaned thoroughly. However, this does not necessarily mean that the room was not cleaned at all. It is possible that the room was cleaned, but not thoroughly. Therefore, the conclusion \"If the room was cleaned thoroughly, then it was not cleaned\" does not logically follow from the premise.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: No, the argument is not logically valid.",
