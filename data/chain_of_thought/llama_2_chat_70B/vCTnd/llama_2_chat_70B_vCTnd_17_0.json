In other words, if the premises are true, must the conclusion also be true?\n\nThe first premise, \"If the customer was greeted, then they were not greeted warmly,\" is a contrapositive statement. Its inverse is \"If the customer was not greeted warmly, then they were greeted.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original premise and can be proven by considering the definition of \"greeted warmly\" as meaning \"not greeted.\"\n\nThe second premise, \"If the customer was greeted warmly, then they were not greeted,\" is also a contrapositive statement. Its inverse is \"If the customer was not greeted, then they were greeted warmly.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original premise and can be proven by considering the definition of \"greeted\" as meaning \"not greeted warmly.\"\n\nGiven that both premises are contrapositive statements, the conclusion logically follows. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
