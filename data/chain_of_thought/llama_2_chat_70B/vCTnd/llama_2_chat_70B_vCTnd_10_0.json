The argument is a conditional statement, with the premise being \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice\" and the conclusion being \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\"\n2. To determine if the argument is logically valid, we need to check if the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise. In other words, we need to see if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premise.\n3. Let's assume that the premise is true. If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice. This means that any advice that was offered was not useful or beneficial in any way.\n4. Now, let's consider the conclusion. If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered. This statement is saying that if advice was helpful, then it was not actually advice. This seems counterintuitive, as we typically think of advice as being helpful.\n5. However, given the premise, we can see why this conclusion might follow. If advice was not helpful, then it's possible that what was offered was not actually advice, but rather something else masquerading as advice. In this case, the conclusion would be true - if helpful advice was offered, then it wasn't actually advice that was offered.\n6. Therefore, based on the premise, the conclusion logically follows. The argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
