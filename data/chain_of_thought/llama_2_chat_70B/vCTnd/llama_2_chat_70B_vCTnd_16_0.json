The premise states that if the job was completed, then it was not completed well, which implies that the speaker believes that the job was not completed well. However, the conclusion reverses this idea and states that if the job was completed well, then it was not completed, which is a contradictory statement.\n\nStep 3: Determine the validity of the argument\n\nSince the argument contains a logical fallacy, it is not logically valid. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, and the argument does not provide sufficient evidence to support its claim.\n\nAnswer: No",
