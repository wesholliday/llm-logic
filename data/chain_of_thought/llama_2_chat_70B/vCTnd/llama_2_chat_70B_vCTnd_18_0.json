In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nLet's evaluate the argument:\n\nPremise: If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth.\n\nAssume this premise is true.\n\nConclusion: If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed.\n\nIf we assume that the issue was discussed in depth, then according to the premise, it was not discussed. Therefore, the conclusion follows necessarily from the premise, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
