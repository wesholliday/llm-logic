In other words, is it impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true?\n\nLet's assume that the premise \"If the room was tidied, then it was not tidied thoroughly\" is true. This means that whenever the room is tidied, it is not tidied thoroughly.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied.\" This statement is saying that if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied at all.\n\nThis conclusion logically follows from the premise because if the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied (according to the premise). Therefore, the conclusion \"If the room was tidied thoroughly, then it was not tidied\" is necessarily true if the premise is true.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
