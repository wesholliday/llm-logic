The argument is a conditional statement with two parts: \"If instructions were given, then they were not explained clearly\" and \"If instructions were explained clearly, then instructions were not given.\"\n2. The first part of the condition (\"If instructions were given\") is the antecedent, and the second part (\"then they were not explained clearly\") is the consequent.\n3. The second part of the condition (\"If instructions were explained clearly\") is the antecedent, and the first part (\"then instructions were not given\") is the consequent.\n4. The argument is structured as a modus tollens, where the first premise is denied and the conclusion is affirmed.\n5. Modus tollens is a valid form of argument, so this argument is logically valid if the premises are true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
