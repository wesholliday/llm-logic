In other words, would the conclusion necessarily be true if the premise were true?\n\nLet's consider a hypothetical situation where the clothes were washed. If the clothes were washed, then according to the premise, they were not washed properly. This means that if the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly.\n\nNow, let's consider the conclusion: If the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed. This statement is saying that if the clothes were washed in a proper manner, then they were not washed at all. This does not follow logically from the premise.\n\nIf the clothes were washed properly, it's possible that they were still washed, just in a proper manner. Therefore, the conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: No, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise.",
