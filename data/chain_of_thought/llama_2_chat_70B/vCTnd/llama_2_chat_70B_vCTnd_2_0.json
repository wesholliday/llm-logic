            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument is in the form of a conditional statement with a negation in the consequent. The premise is \"If Ann exercised, then she did not exercise strenuously,\" and the conclusion is \"If Ann exercised strenuously, then she did not exercise.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the logical fallacy\n\nThe argument is an example of a logical fallacy called \"denying the antecedent.\" In this type of fallacy, the conclusion is reached by denying the antecedent (first part) of the premise, rather than addressing the consequent (second part).\n\nStep 3: Explain why it's a logical fallacy\n\nThe argument is flawed because it assumes that just because Ann did not exercise strenuously, it means she did not exercise at all. This does not follow logically, as there is no evidence to suggest that Ann did not exercise at all simply because she did not exercise strenuously. In fact, it's possible for someone to exercise without exercising strenuously.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: No, the argument is not logically valid.",
