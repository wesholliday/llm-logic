A truth table is a chart that shows all possible combinations of true or false values for the premises and conclusion of an argument, along with the resulting logical outcome.\n\nHere's a truth table for the argument in question:\n\n| Ben studied | Ben studied diligently | Conclusion |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| True | False | False |\n| False | True | True |\n\nAs we can see from the truth table, when the premise \"If Ben studied, then he did not study diligently\" is true, the conclusion \"If Ben studied diligently, then he did not study\" is false. Therefore, the argument is logically invalid.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: No, the argument is not logically valid.",
