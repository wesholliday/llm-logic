            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the argument\n\nThe argument in question is a conditional statement with two parts:\n\nPremise: If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\nConclusion: If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\n\nStep 2: Identify the type of argument\n\nThis argument is a form of logical reasoning known as modus tollens. Modus tollens is a type of argument that uses the contrapositive form of a conditional statement to reach a conclusion.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the argument\n\nTo determine whether the argument is logically valid, we need to examine the relationship between the premise and conclusion. In modus tollens, the conclusion follows logically from the premise if the premise is true.\n\nIn this case, the premise states that if the customer was served, then he was not served promptly. This means that if the customer was served promptly, then he must not have been served (since being served promptly is a contradiction to the premise). Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes, the argument is logically valid.",
