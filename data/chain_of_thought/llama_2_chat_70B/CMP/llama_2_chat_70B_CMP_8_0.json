    "user_prompt": "Suppose that India, China, and Russia are the world's leading emerging economies. Economists project it's likely India's economy will grow the fastest this year, followed closely by China's, with Russia's growth rate lagging distantly behind. These are by far the biggest emerging economies, so if China is not the top-growing emerging economy, then if India isn\u2019t, Russia will be. Moreover, India's economy likely will grow the fastest of these three and hence China's likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be?",

There is a possibility that China's economy might still grow faster than Russia's even if India's doesn't grow the fastest. Therefore, the statement \"it's likely that, if India isn\u2019t the top-growing emerging economy, Russia will be\" cannot be concluded with certainty.\n\nAnswer: No",
