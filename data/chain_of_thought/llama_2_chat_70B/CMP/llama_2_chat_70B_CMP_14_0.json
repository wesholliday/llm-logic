    "user_prompt": "Suppose that increases to minimum wage, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness are the most likely new laws. Only one new law will be passed this session. Congress watchers expect a minimum wage hike is most probable, followed by paid family leave, with loan forgiveness being much less likely. These are the only likely new laws, so if paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen. Moreover, a minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen. Does it follow that it's likely that, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will?",

Make sure not to answer with 'Answer:' until *after* you think step by step and explain your reasoning.",

            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* Three potential new laws: minimum wage increase, paid family leave, and student loan forgiveness.\n* Most probable law: minimum wage hike.\n* Second most probable law: paid family leave.\n* Least probable law: student loan forgiveness.\n* If paid leave doesn't happen, then if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, loan forgiveness will happen.\n* A minimum wage hike likely will happen and hence paid leave likely won't happen.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\n* Based on the given information, we can conclude that the probability of a minimum wage hike happening is higher than paid family leave, and paid family leave is more probable than student loan forgiveness.\n* If paid family leave doesn't happen, then the next most probable law is student loan forgiveness.\n* However, since a minimum wage hike likely will happen, it reduces the probability of paid family leave occurring.\n* Therefore, if a minimum wage hike doesn't happen, it's likely that student loan forgiveness will happen.\n\nStep 3: Answer the question\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
