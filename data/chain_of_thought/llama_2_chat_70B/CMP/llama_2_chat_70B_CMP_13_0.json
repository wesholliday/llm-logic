    "user_prompt": "Suppose that Tennessee, Georgia, and Missouri are projected to have the strongest job growth this year in the US. Economists expect Tennessee likely will add the most jobs, followed closely by Georgia, with Missouri's growth significantly lower. These states lead growth, so if Georgia doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, then if Tennessee doesn\u2019t, Missouri will. Moreover, Tennessee likely will add the most jobs and hence Georgia likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it\u2019s likely that, if Tennessee doesn\u2019t add the most jobs, Missouri will?",

Georgia is expected to add a large number of jobs, but fewer than Tennessee.\n3. Missouri's job growth is significantly lower than Tennessee and Georgia.\n4. If Georgia doesn't add the most jobs, then Tennessee won't either.\n5. If Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, then Missouri will.\n6. Therefore, if Tennessee doesn't add the most jobs, it's likely that Missouri will.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
