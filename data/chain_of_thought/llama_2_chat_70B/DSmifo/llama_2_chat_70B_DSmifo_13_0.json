This is because the second statement provides a dichotomy between the bookshelf and the toy box, and if the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box by process of elimination.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, we can infer that \"The toy is in the toy box.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
