The statement \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" implies that there are only two possible locations for the remote control: under the couch or on the coffee table.\n2. The statement \"The remote control might not be hiding under the couch\" suggests that the remote control may not be located under the couch.\n3. If the remote control is not located under the couch, then it must be located on the coffee table, since those are the only two possible locations according to the first statement.\n\nTherefore, based on the two given statements, we can infer that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
