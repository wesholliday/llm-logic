Either the sunglasses are worn by the woman (perched on her head), or they are in her bag.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\n* Since \"The sunglasses might not be perched on her head\" implies that the sunglasses may not be worn by the woman, we can deduce that the second possibility in the disjunctive statement (\"they are in her bag\") is true.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the sunglasses are in the woman's bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
