It's uncertain.\n* \"Either the jacket must be hanging in the closet or it is draped over the chair\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the jacket: either it's hanging in the closet or it's draped over the chair.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\n* Since \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" implies that the jacket may not be hanging in the closet, we can deduce that the jacket is not necessarily hanging in the closet.\n* Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining option for the location of the jacket is that it's draped over the chair.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the jacket is indeed draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
