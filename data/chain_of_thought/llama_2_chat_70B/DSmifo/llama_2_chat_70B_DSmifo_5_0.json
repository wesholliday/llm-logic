The statement \"The cookies might not be hidden in the pantry\" implies that the cookies are not necessarily in the pantry.\n2. The statement \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the cookies: the pantry or the jar.\n3. Since the cookies might not be in the pantry (according to the first statement), it is possible that they are in the jar.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
