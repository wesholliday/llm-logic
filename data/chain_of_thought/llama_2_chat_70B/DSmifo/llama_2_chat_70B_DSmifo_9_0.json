The statement \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\" implies that there is a possibility that the missing puzzle piece is not on the floor, and therefore, it could be somewhere else.\n2. The statement \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the missing puzzle piece: either it's on the floor, blending in, or it's in the box.\n3. Since we've established that the missing puzzle piece might not be on the floor, it's possible that it's in the box.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that \"The missing puzzle piece is in the box\" is a valid conclusion based on the given statements.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
