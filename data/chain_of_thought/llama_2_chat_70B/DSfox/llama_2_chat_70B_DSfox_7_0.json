These are the only two possible states for the whiffle.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the information\n\n* Since the whiffle is not tinked, it means that it cannot be in the state of being tinked.\n* Therefore, the only possible state left for the whiffle is being shanked.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, we can infer that the whiffle is shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
