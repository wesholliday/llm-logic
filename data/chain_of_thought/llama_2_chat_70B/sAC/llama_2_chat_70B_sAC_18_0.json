Therefore, the doll was plastic (conclusion)\n\nI have used modus ponens to arrive at the conclusion. Modus ponens is a valid form of argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. In this case, the premises are 'If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal' and 'The truck was metal', which are both true. Therefore, the conclusion 'The doll was plastic' must also be true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
