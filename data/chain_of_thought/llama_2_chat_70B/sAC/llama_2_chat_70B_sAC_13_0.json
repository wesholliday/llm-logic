Therefore, the car was red (conclusion)\n\nI have used modus ponens to arrive at the conclusion. Modus ponens is a valid form of argument where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, the premises are 'If the car was red, then the truck was blue' and 'The truck was blue', so the conclusion 'The car was red' logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
