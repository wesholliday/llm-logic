If the statement \"If the apple was red, then the banana was yellow\" is true, it means that whenever the apple is red, the banana is necessarily yellow.\n2. We know that the banana was indeed yellow, so we can conclude that the premise of the first statement (\"If the apple was red\") must be true.\n3. Therefore, we can deduce that the apple was indeed red.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
