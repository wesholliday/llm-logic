If the antecedent (D) is false, the statement is true regardless of the consequent (C).\n2. If the consequent (C) is false, the statement is false regardless of the antecedent (D).\n3. If both the antecedent (D) and consequent (C) are true, the statement is valid.\n\nStep 3: Apply the rules to the given information\n\nSince 'The cat was outside' (C) is true, let's assess the antecedent 'If the dog was inside' (D). If D is false, the statement is true regardless of C, so we can conclude that D is indeed false. Therefore, the argument is valid, and 'The dog was inside' (D) is false.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can conclude that 'The dog was inside' (D) is false.\n\nAnswer: No",
