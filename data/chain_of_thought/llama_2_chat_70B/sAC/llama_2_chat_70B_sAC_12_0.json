If \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo\" is true, it means that there is a conditional relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo.\n2. We know that \"Lucy went to the zoo\" is true.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the condition in step 1 has been satisfied, meaning that Joe went to the park.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
