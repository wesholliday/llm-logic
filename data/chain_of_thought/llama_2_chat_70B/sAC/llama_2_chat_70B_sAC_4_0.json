Therefore, the alien visited Mars (conclusion)\n\nI have used modus ponens to arrive at the conclusion. Modus ponens is a valid form of argument where if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. In this case, the first premise is \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" which is given as true, and the second premise is \"The robot visited Jupiter\" which is also given as true. Therefore, using modus ponens, we can conclude that \"The alien visited Mars\" is true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
