The statement \"Either the missing sock is in the laundry basket or it's under the bed\" implies that there are only two possible locations for the missing sock.\n2. The statement \"The missing sock isn't under the bed\" rules out one of those possibilities, leaving only the laundry basket as a potential location.\n3.
