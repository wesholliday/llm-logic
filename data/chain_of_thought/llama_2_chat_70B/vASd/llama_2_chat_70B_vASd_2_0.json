In other words, would the conclusion be true if the premise were true?\n\nIf we go to the concert, then we'll have a good time (premise)\nIf we go to the concert and a bomb goes off, then we'll have a good time (conclusion)\n\nThe conclusion does not necessarily follow from the premise. The premise only states that going to the concert will result in having a good time, it doesn't account for any external factors that might affect our experience. The presence of a bomb would likely negate the possibility of having a good time, regardless of whether we go to the concert or not.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
