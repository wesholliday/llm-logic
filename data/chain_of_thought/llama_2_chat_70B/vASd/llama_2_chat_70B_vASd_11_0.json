The conclusion of the argument is \"If you get enough sleep and do hard labor, you won't be tired.\"\n3. The conclusion follows logically from the premise, because if you get enough sleep, you won't be tired, and if you do hard labor, you will be physically exhausted.\n4. Therefore, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
