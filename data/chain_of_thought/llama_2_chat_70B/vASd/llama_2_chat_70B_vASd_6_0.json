In other words, if the premise is true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n\nIn this case, the premise \"If you scream, it will hurt my ears\" is a straightforward statement that implies a causal relationship between screaming and hurting ears. The conclusion \"If you scream and I am wearing earplugs, it will hurt my ears\" adds a new condition (I am wearing earplugs) to the original premise, but it does not change the underlying causal relationship between screaming and hurting ears.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
