In this case, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premise states that finishing homework allows the person to play video games, but it does not imply that playing video games is still possible if the computer catches on fire. In fact, the latter scenario would likely make it impossible to play video games.\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises, and therefore, the argument is invalid.\n\nAnswer: No",
