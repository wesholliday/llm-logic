In this case, the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises. Fertilizing the lawn may indeed make it lush and green, but a drought could still cause the lawn to become dry and brown, regardless of whether it has been fertilized or not. Therefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
