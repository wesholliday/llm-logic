The argument is a conditional statement, with the premise being \"If the bill is paid, then the services will continue\" and the conclusion being \"If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue\".\n2. A conditional statement is logically valid if and only if its conclusion follows necessarily from its premises. In other words, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must also be true.\n3. The premise \"If the bill is paid, then the services will continue\" is a causal relationship between paying the bill and continuing the services. It means that as long as the bill is paid, the services will continue.\n4. The conclusion \"If the bill is paid and the check bounces, then the services will continue\" adds an additional condition to the premise, which is \"and the check bounces\". This means that even if the check bounces, the services will still continue as long as the bill has been paid.\n5. Since the conclusion follows logically from the premises, the argument is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
