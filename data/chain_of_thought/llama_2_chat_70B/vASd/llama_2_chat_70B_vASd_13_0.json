This is a common belief and supported by scientific evidence. Therefore, the premise is true.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the conclusion\nThe conclusion states that if the premise is true, then exercising and eating junk food will also lead to weight loss. However, this does not logically follow from the premise. While exercising may help with weight loss, consuming junk food can lead to weight gain due to its high calorie content. Therefore, the conclusion is false.\n\nStep 4: Determine the validity of the argument\nSince the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
