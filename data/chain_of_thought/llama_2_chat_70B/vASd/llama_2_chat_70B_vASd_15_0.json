In other words, is it impossible for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true?\n\nThe premise \"If I charge my phone, it will have power\" is assumed to be true for the sake of the argument. The conclusion \"If I charge my phone and it has a dead battery, it will have power\" does not necessarily follow from the premise. It is possible that the phone's battery is dead and charging it will not provide enough power to turn it on.\n\nTherefore, the argument is not logically valid.\n\nAnswer: No",
