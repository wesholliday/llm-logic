The premise of the argument is a conditional statement, \"If I change the oil, the car will run smoothly.\" This means that if the condition of changing the oil is met, then the consequence of the car running smoothly will follow.\n2. The conclusion of the argument is also a conditional statement, \"If I change the oil and the transmission is shot, the car will run smoothly.\" This means that if both conditions, changing the oil and the transmission being shot, are met, then the consequence of the car running smoothly will follow.\n3. The conclusion follows logically from the premise because if the oil is changed and the transmission is shot, then the car's engine will still run smoothly, even though the transmission may not be functioning properly.\n4. Therefore, this form of argument is logically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
