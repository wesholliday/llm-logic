In other words, we need to see if the conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the argument\nThe premise \"If the essay is well-written, then the student will get an A\" seems reasonable and is likely true. The conclusion \"If the essay is well-written and turned in late, then the student will get an A\" does not logically follow from the premise. It is possible that the student may still get an A even if they turn the essay in late, but it is also possible that they may not get an A due to the lateness.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\nAnswer: No, the argument is not logically valid. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.",
