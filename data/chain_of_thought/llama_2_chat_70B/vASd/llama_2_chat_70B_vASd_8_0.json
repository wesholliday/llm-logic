The conclusion adds an additional condition \"and it was misrouted\" to the premise.\n3. The conclusion still maintains the same logical connection between the conditions and the outcome as the premise, which is a conditional statement.\n4. Since the conclusion logically follows from the premises, the argument is valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
