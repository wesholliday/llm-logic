In this case, the conclusion does not follow necessarily from the premises. The premise only states that taking medication will make the person feel better, but it does not guarantee that taking expired medication will have the same effect. In fact, taking expired medication may have negative effects or no effect at all.\n\nStep 3: Determine the answer\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the argument is not logically valid. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
