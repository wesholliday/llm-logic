The statement \"Either the toy is in the toy box or it must be sitting on the bookshelf\" implies that the toy can only be in one of two places: the toy box or the bookshelf.\n2. We know that the toy might not be sitting on the bookshelf, which means it's possible that it's not on the bookshelf.\n3. If the toy is not on the bookshelf, then it must be in the toy box, since those are the only two options.\n\nTherefore, based on the given statements, we can conclude that the toy is in the toy box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
