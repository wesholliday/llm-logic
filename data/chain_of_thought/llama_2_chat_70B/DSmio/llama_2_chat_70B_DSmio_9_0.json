The statement \"Either the missing puzzle piece is in the box or it must be blending in on the floor\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the missing puzzle piece.\n2. The statement \"The missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor\" implies that the second option, \"it must be blending in on the floor,\" is not necessarily true.\n3. If the second option is not true, then the first option, \"the missing puzzle piece is in the box,\" must be true.\n\nTherefore, based on the two given statements, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
