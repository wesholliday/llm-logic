The watch is charging on the dresser: This means that the watch is not on his wrist, which aligns with the first piece of information.\n2. The watch must be on his wrist: If the watch is not charging on the dresser, then it must be on his wrist, according to the second piece of information. However, this contradicts the first piece of information that states the watch might not be on his wrist.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince the second option leads to a contradiction, we can conclude that the first option is true: The watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
