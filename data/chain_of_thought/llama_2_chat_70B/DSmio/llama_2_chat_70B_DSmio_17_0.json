Either the scarf is stuffed in my backpack or it must be draped on the coat rack (this is a disjunctive statement, meaning that one of the two options must be true).\n3. If the scarf is not draped on the coat rack, then it must be stuffed in your backpack (this follows from the second premise).\n4. Therefore, the scarf is stuffed in your backpack.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
