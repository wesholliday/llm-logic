This means there is a possibility that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry.\n2. The second premise states that either the cookies are in the jar or they must be hidden in the pantry. This means that if the cookies are not hidden in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\n3. Since there is a possibility that the cookies are not hidden in the pantry (from premise 1), and if they're not hidden in the pantry then they must be in the jar (from premise 2), we can conclude that the cookies are in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
