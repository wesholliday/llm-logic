The statement \"Either the notebook is in the drawer or it must be sitting on the nightstand\" implies that the notebook cannot be in any other location besides the drawer or the nightstand.\n2. The statement \"The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand\" suggests that the notebook could be in a different location, but we know that it cannot be in any other location besides the drawer or the nightstand based on the first statement.\n3. Therefore, if the notebook is not sitting on the nightstand, then it must be in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
