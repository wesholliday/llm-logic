The premise \"The book might not be resting on the table\" implies that the book could be resting on the table or it could not be resting on the table.\n2. The premise \"Either the book is on the shelf or it must be resting on the table\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the book: either it is on the shelf or it is resting on the table.\n3. If the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf, since those are the only two options presented.\n4. Therefore, we can infer that the book is on the shelf.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
