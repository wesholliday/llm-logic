It only implies that the jacket may not be in the closet, leaving open the possibility that it's somewhere else.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the second premise\n\n* \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents a dichotomy: if the jacket is not hanging in the closet, then it must be draped over the chair.\n\nStep 4: Combine the premises\n\n* Since \"The jacket might not be hanging in the closet\" does not necessarily mean that the jacket is draped over the chair, and \"Either the jacket is draped over the chair or it must be hanging in the closet\" presents an exclusive dichotomy, we can infer that the jacket might be draped over the chair.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
