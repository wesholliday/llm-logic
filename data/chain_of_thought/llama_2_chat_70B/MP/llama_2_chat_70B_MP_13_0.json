Therefore, the truck was blue (conclusion)\n\nBy modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion from the premises. The first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the car and truck, stating that if the car is red, then the truck must be blue. The second premise states that the car is indeed red. Therefore, we can logically conclude that the truck must be blue.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
