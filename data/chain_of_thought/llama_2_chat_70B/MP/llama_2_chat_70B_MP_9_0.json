Modus ponens states that if A implies B, and A is true, then B must be true. In this case, A is \"Lisa bought the red shirt\" (the first part of the conditional statement), and B is \"Mark bought the blue shirt\" (the second part of the conditional statement). Since A is true (given in the problem statement), and B is implied by A (through the conditional statement), we can conclude that B is true.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the application of modus ponens, we can infer that Mark bought the blue shirt.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
