Since we know that the vampire is indeed awake, we can conclude that the mummy is also awake.\n\nStep 3: Check for any assumptions or logical fallacies\n\nThere don't appear to be any obvious assumptions or logical fallacies in this argument. The conclusion logically follows from the given information.\n\nStep 4: Final answer\n\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer that the mummy was awake based on the given information.",
