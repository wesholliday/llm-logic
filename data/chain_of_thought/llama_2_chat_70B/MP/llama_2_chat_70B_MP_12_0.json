(Hypothetical statement)\n* Joe went to the park. (Fact)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the hypothetical statement.\n\nThe hypothetical statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship between Joe going to the park and Lucy going to the zoo. It suggests that if Joe went to the park, then Lucy must have gone to the zoo.\n\nStep 3: Consider the fact.\n\nJoe went to the park. This means that the condition specified in the hypothetical statement has been met.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\n\nSince the condition for the hypothetical statement has been met, and the statement implies a cause-and-effect relationship, it is reasonable to infer that Lucy went to the zoo.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
