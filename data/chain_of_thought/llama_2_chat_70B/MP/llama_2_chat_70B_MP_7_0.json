(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\nIn this case, we can use Modus Ponens (MP) to infer the conclusion from the premises. MP states that if \"If A then B\" and \"A\", then \"B\".\n\nStep 3: Apply Modus Ponens to derive the conclusion:\n\n* If Alex finished the race, then Chris finished the race. (Premise 1)\n* Alex finished the race. (Premise 2)\n* Therefore, Chris finished the race. (Conclusion)\n\nStep 4: Check for validity of the argument.\nThe argument is valid because it follows the correct form of Modus Ponens. The conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
