(Premise 2)\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.\n\nThe first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the cake and the muffins, stating that if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry. The second premise simply states that the cake is indeed chocolate.\n\nStep 3: Use logical reasoning to determine whether the conclusion can be inferred from the premises.\n\nSince the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the cake and the muffins, and the second premise confirms that the cake is chocolate, it logically follows that the muffins must be blueberry. In other words, if the cake is chocolate, then the muffins must be blueberry, and since the cake is indeed chocolate, it is reasonable to infer that the muffins are blueberry.\n\nStep 4: Write a clear and concise answer.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
