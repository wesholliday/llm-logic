(This is the given premise)\n2. The book was written by James. (This is the second given premise)\n3. Therefore, the book is a mystery novel. (Conclusion)\n\nThe reasoning is based on modus ponens, which states that if \"If A then B\" and \"A\", then \"B\". In this case, A is \"the book was written by James\" and B is \"the book is a mystery novel\". Since we know that A is true (from the second premise), and we know that If A then B (from the first premise), we can conclude that B is true, which means the book is a mystery novel.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
