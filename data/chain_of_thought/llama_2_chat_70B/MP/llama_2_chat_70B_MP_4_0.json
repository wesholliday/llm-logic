In this case, we know that the alien visited Mars (premise), and we want to deduce whether the robot visited Jupiter (conclusion).\n\nStep 3: Conclude\n\nUsing Modus Ponens, we can conclude that the robot visited Jupiter. This is because the premise (\"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\") is true, and we know that the alien visited Mars. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
