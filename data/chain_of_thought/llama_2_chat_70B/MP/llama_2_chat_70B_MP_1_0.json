Mary was at the wedding (premise 2)\n3. Therefore, Sue was at the wedding (conclusion)\n\nThe argument follows the form of a valid deductive argument, Modus Ponens, which has the following form:\n\n1. If A, then B\n2. A\n3. Therefore, B\n\nIn this case, A is \"Mary was at the wedding\" and B is \"Sue was at the wedding\". The first premise states that if A is true, then B must also be true. The second premise confirms that A is indeed true. Therefore, we can logically conclude that B is true, which means Sue was at the wedding.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
