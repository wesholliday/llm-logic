If the premise \"the griffin was in the forest\" is true, then the conclusion \"the unicorn was in the forest\" must also be true.\n* \"The griffin was in the forest\" - This is a statement of fact.\n\nStep 2: Apply the given information to the problem\n\nUsing the conditional statement, we can infer that if the griffin was in the forest, then the unicorn must also be in the forest. Since we know that the griffin was indeed in the forest, we can conclude that the unicorn was also in the forest.\n\nStep 3: Check for any assumptions or ambiguities\n\nThere are no apparent assumptions or ambiguities in the given information. The conditional statement is clear and straightforward, and the factual statement about the griffin's location is not disputable.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the given information, we can conclude that the unicorn was in the forest.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
