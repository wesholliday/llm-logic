In this case, the negated statement is not logically equivalent to the original statement because it does not convey the same meaning. The original statement implies that preparing a meal carefully means it was not prepared, while the negated statement implies that preparing a meal carefully means it was prepared.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the meal was prepared carefully, then it was not prepared\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
