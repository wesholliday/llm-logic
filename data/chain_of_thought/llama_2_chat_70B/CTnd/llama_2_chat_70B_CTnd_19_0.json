The antecedent \"directions were provided\" implies the consequent \"they were not explained clearly.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the structure of the statement to be inferred \"If directions were explained clearly, then directions were not provided.\"\n\nThis statement is also in the form of a conditional tautology. The antecedent \"directions were explained clearly\" implies the consequent \"directions were not provided.\"\n\nStep 3: Determine if the inference can be made.\n\nSince both statements are in the same format, we can infer the second statement from the first one by simply switching the antecedents and consequents. This is a valid form of reasoning known as contrapositive reasoning.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
