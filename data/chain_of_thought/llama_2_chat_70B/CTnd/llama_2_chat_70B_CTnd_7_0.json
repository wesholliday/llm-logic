            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the original statement \"If the customer was served, then he was not served promptly.\"\nThis statement implies that serving the customer and serving the customer promptly are mutually exclusive events. In other words, if the customer was served, it means that he was not served promptly, and vice versa.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the inference \"If the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\"\nThis inference is essentially the contrapositive of the original statement. The contrapositive of a statement is formed by switching the hypothesis and conclusion, while maintaining the same logical relationship. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the customer was served promptly,\" and the conclusion is \"he was not served.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the inference.\nSince the original statement is true, its contrapositive should also be true. Therefore, we can infer that if the customer was served promptly, then he was not served.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
