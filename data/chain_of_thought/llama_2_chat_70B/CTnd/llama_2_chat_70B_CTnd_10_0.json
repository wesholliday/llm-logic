            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the original statement \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\"\nThis statement implies that any advice given was not useful or effective.\n\nStep 2: Consider the inverse of the statement \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\"\nThe inverse would be \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the validity of the inverse statement.\nThe inverse statement is logically sound because it follows from the original statement. If helpful advice was offered, then by definition, it was not unhelpful advice. Therefore, if helpful advice was offered, it means that no unhelpful advice was offered, which is equivalent to saying that no advice was offered.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If helpful advice was offered, then advice was not offered\" from the statement \"If advice was offered, it was not helpful advice.\"",
