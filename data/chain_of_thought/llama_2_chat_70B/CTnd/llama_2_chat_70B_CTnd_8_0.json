In other words, simply addressing the issue does not guarantee that it was addressed in a way that solves the problem or achieves the desired outcome.\n\nStep 2: Consider the converse of the original statement.\n\nThe converse of the original statement would be \"If the issue was not addressed effectively, then it was addressed.\" This statement suggests that if the issue was not addressed effectively, then it must have been addressed in some way, even if that way was not effective.\n\nStep 3: Determine whether the converse implies the inverse.\n\nIn this case, the converse does imply the inverse. If the issue was not addressed effectively, then it must have been addressed in some way, which means that it was addressed. Therefore, we can infer that if the issue was addressed effectively, then it was not addressed.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
