The premise \"If the clothes were washed, then they were not washed properly\" implies that if the clothes were washed, then they must not have been washed properly, since proper washing would have resulted in clean clothes.\n2. Now, let's consider the converse of this statement: \"If the clothes were not washed properly, then they were not washed.\" This statement is logically equivalent to the original premise, since if the clothes were not washed properly, then they must not have been washed at all.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that if the clothes were washed properly, then they were not washed, since proper washing would have resulted in clean clothes, and the fact that the clothes are not clean suggests that they were not washed at all.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
