            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\"\nThis statement is in the form of a conditional tautology, which means that the conclusion follows logically from the premise. In this case, the premise is \"it's raining,\" and the conclusion is \"it's not raining hard.\"\n\nStep 2: Analyze the structure of the statement.\nThe statement can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. \"If it's raining\" - This part of the statement expresses a condition or hypothesis.\n2. \"then it's not raining hard\" - This part of the statement expresses the conclusion or consequence of the condition.\n\nStep 3: Consider the negation of the statement.\nTo infer \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining,\" we need to negate the original statement. The negation of \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard\" would be \"If it's raining, then it is raining hard.\"\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the negation.\nThe negation of the statement is a contrapositive, which means that it is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then the negation must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion.\nBased on the above analysis, we can infer \"If it's raining hard, then it's not raining\" from the given statement \"If it's raining, then it's not raining hard.\" This is because the negation of the original statement is logically equivalent to the contrapositive.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
