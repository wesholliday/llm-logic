            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\n\"If I went to the store, then I did not buy vegetables\"\nThis statement is in the form of a conditional tautology, where the antecedent is \"I went to the store\" and the consequent is \"I did not buy vegetables\".\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the given statement\nThe contrapositive of a statement is obtained by switching the antecedent and consequent and negating both parts. In this case, the contrapositive would be:\n\"If I did not buy vegetables, then I went to the store\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the contrapositive implies the desired inference\nThe desired inference is \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\". To determine if this inference can be made, we need to evaluate whether the contrapositive implies it.\n\nStep 4: Negate the antecedent of the contrapositive\nNegating the antecedent of the contrapositive gives us:\n\"If I did not buy vegetables, then I did not go to the store\"\n\nStep 5: Evaluate whether the negated antecedent implies the desired inference\nThe negated antecedent implies that if we did not buy vegetables, then we did not go to the store. This means that if we bought vegetables, we must have gone to the store, which is the opposite of what we want to infer.\n\nStep 6: Conclude whether the given statement implies the desired inference\nSince the contrapositive does not imply the desired inference, we cannot infer \"If I bought vegetables, then I did not go to the store\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
