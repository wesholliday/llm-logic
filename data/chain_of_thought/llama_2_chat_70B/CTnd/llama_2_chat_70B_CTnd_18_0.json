The premise \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth\" implies that discussing an issue in depth is mutually exclusive with simply discussing it.\n2. This means that if an issue was discussed in depth, it cannot be said that it was simply discussed.\n3. Therefore, the negation of \"If the issue was discussed, then it was not discussed in depth\" would be \"If the issue was not discussed in depth, then it was discussed.\"\n4. This is equivalent to saying \"If the issue was discussed in depth, then it was not discussed,\" which is the desired inference.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
