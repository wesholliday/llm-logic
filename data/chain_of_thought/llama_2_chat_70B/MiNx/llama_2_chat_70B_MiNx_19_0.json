Therefore, the negation \"It's not the case that the smonk must have been vreebled\" is not necessarily true.\n\nStep 4: Consider alternative scenarios.\nThere could be other possibilities where the smonk was not vreebled, or where its state of being vreebled is still unknown.\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion based on the analysis.\nBased on the given statement, we cannot infer that the smonk must have been vreebled, but we also cannot rule out the possibility that it was not vreebled. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: No",
