Therefore, we cannot infer the negation of \"The zinger must have been fraggled\" from \"The zinger might not have been fraggled.\"\n\nStep 4: Answer the question.\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"It's not the case that the zinger must have been fraggled\" from \"The zinger might not have been fraggled.\"",
