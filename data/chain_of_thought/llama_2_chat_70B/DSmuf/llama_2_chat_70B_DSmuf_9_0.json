The statement \"Either the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor or it is in the box\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the missing puzzle piece.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the missing puzzle piece must be blending in on the floor\" rules out the first option, meaning that the missing puzzle piece cannot be blending in on the floor.\n3. By process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nTherefore, based on the two given statements, we can infer that the missing puzzle piece is in the box.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
