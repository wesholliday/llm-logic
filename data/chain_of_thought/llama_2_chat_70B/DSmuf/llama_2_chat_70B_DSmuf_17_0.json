The statement \"Either the scarf must be draped on the coat rack or it is stuffed in my backpack\" presents two exclusive options for the scarf's location.\n2. The statement \"It's not the case that the scarf must be draped on the coat rack\" implies that the first option (the scarf being draped on the coat rack) is not possible.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
