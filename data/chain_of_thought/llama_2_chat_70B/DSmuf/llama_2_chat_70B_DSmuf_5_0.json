Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. \"Either the cookies must be hidden in the pantry or they are in the jar\" - This statement presents two exclusive options for the location of the cookies.\n2. \"It's not the case that the cookies must be hidden in the pantry\" - This statement rules out the first option, meaning the cookies cannot be hidden in the pantry.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the cookies must be in the jar.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
