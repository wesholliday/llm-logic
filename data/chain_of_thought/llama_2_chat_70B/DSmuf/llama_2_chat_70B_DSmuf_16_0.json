'Either the pen must be on my desk or it is in my bag' - This statement implies that the pen must be in one of two places, either on the desk or in the bag.\n2. 'It's not the case that the pen must be on my desk' - This statement rules out the possibility that the pen must be on the desk.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the pen must be in the bag.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
