The statement \"Either the remote control must be hiding under the couch or it is on the coffee table\" presents two exclusive options for the location of the remote control.\n2. The phrase \"It's not the case that the remote control must be hiding under the couch\" indicates that the first option, \"the remote control must be hiding under the couch,\" is not true.\n3. Therefore, by process of elimination, the only remaining option is that the remote control is on the coffee table.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
