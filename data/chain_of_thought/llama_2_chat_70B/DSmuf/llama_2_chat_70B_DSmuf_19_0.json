This is because the only two possibilities for the watch are being on his wrist or charging on the dresser, and we've already established that it's not on his wrist.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBased on the information provided, we can infer that the watch is charging on the dresser.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
