The second premise suggests that the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor.\n3. If the missing puzzle piece might not be blending in on the floor, then it must be in the box, since those are the only two options presented in the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the missing puzzle piece is in the box logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
