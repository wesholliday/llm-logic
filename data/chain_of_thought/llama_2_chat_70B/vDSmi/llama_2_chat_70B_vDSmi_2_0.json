The second premise states that the book might not be resting on the table, which means that the possibility of the book being on the shelf remains.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the book is not resting on the table, then it must be on the shelf.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the book is on the shelf logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
