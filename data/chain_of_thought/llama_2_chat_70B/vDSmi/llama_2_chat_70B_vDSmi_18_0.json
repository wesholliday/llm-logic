The second premise suggests that the notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand, which means that option 2 is uncertain or potentially false.\n3. If option 2 is uncertain or false, then option 1 must be true, which means that the notebook is in the drawer.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: The notebook is in the drawer.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
