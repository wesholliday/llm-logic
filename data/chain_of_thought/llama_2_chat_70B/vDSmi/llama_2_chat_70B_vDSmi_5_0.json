The second premise suggests that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry, which means that the possibility of the cookies being in the pantry is not certain.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the cookies are not in the pantry, then they must be in the jar.\n4. Since the second premise indicates that the cookies might not be hidden in the pantry, it supports the idea that the cookies could be in the jar.\n5. Therefore, the conclusion that the cookies are in the jar logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
