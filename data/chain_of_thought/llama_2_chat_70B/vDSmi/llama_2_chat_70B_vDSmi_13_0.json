The second premise states that the toy might not be on the shelf, which means it's possible that the toy is not on the shelf.\n3. If the toy is not on the shelf, then by process of elimination, it must be in the toy box, since that's the only other option presented in the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the toy is in the toy box logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
