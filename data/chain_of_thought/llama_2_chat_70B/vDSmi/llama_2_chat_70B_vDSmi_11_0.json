The second premise suggests that the newspaper might not be on the porch, which means it's possible that it's in the driveway.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the newspaper isn't on the porch, then it must be in the driveway.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises: the newspaper is in the driveway.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
