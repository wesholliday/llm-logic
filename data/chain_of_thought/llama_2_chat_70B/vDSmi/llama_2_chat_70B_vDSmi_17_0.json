The second premise suggests that the scarf might not be on the coat rack, which means it's possible that the scarf is not on the coat rack.\n3. If the scarf is not on the coat rack, then by process of elimination, it must be in the backpack.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the scarf is stuffed in my backpack logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
