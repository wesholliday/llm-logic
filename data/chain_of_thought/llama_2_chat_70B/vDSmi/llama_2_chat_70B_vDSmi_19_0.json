The second premise suggests that the watch might not be on his wrist, which means that the first option - the watch charging on the dresser - becomes the only remaining possibility.\n3. Based on the above, the conclusion that the watch is charging on the dresser logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
