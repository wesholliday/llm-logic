Either A or B.\n2. Not B.\n3. Therefore, A.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the premises\n\nPremise 1 is a disjunction, which means that it presents two exclusive options. In this case, the options are \"the pen is in my bag\" or \"it must be on my desk.\" Premise 2 states that the second option (\"it must be on my desk\") is not true.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the conclusion\n\nThe conclusion logically follows from the premises. Since Premise 1 presents two exclusive options, and Premise 2 negates one of those options, the only remaining option is that the pen is in my bag. Therefore, the conclusion \"The pen is in my bag\" is logically valid.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
