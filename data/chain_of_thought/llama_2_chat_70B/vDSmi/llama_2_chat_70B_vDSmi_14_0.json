The second premise suggests that the milk might not be in the fridge, which means it's possible that it's on the counter.\n3. Based on the first premise, if the milk is not in the fridge, then it must be on the counter.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the milk is on the counter logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
