The second premise suggests that the remote control might not be hiding under the couch, which means it's possible that it's not hiding under the couch.\n3. If the remote control is not hiding under the couch, then by process of elimination, it must be on the coffee table.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the remote control is on the coffee table logically follows from the premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
