The second premise suggests that the umbrella might not be in the closet, which means it's possible that it's not tucked away in the closet.\n3. If the umbrella is not tucked away in the closet, then it must be in the car, based on the first premise.\n4. Therefore, the conclusion that the umbrella is in the car logically follows from the two premises.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
