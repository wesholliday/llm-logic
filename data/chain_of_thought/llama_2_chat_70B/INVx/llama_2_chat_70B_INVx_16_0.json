In this case, the hypothesis is \"the sneg was crampled\" and the conclusion is \"the sneg sproted the frink.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the hypothesis and conclusion\nNegating the hypothesis gives us \"the sneg was not crampled,\" and negating the conclusion gives us \"the sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nStep 4: Form the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is \"If the sneg was not crampled, then the sneg did not sprot the frink.\"\n\nStep 5: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
