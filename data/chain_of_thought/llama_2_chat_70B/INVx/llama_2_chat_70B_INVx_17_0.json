In this case, the hypothesis is \"the flob was skizzled\" and the conclusion is \"the flob movated.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the hypothesis and conclusion\nNegating the hypothesis gives us \"the flob was not skizzled,\" and negating the conclusion gives us \"the flob was not movated.\"\n\nStep 4: Form the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is \"If the flob was not skizzled, then the flob was not movated.\"\n\nStep 5: Check for logical equivalence\nThe original statement and the contrapositive statement are logically equivalent, meaning that they have the same truth value.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
