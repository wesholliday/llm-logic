            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" It means that if the dreb was vroombed (whatever that means), then it follows that the dreb was spened.\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive\nTo infer the statement \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened,\" we need to find the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is a statement that has the same logical meaning as the original statement but with the order of the premises reversed. In this case, the contrapositive would be \"If the dreb was not spened, then the dreb was not vroombed.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the contrapositive\nTo infer the statement \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened,\" we need to negate the contrapositive. Negating the contrapositive gives us \"If the dreb was spened, then the dreb was vroombed.\"\n\nStep 4: Check the logical equivalence\nWe can see that the statement \"If the dreb was not vroombed, then the dreb was not spened\" logically follows from the original statement \"If the dreb was vroombed, then the dreb was spened.\" They have the same logical meaning, just with different wording.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
