The contrapositive is a statement that has the same logical meaning as the original statement but with the order of the premises reversed.\n\nStep 3: Formulate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement of \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged\" would be \"If the clug did not snug, then it was not fleeked.\" This statement means that if the clug did not experience snugging, then it was not in a state of being fleeked.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement \"If the clug did not snug, then it was not fleeked\" is logically equivalent to the original statement \"If the clug was fleeked, then the clug snugged.\" This means that if we can infer the conclusion \"the clug was not snugged\" from the premise \"the clug was not fleeked,\" then we can also infer the conclusion \"the clug was not fleeked\" from the premise \"the clug did not snug.\"\n\nStep 5: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the above analysis, we can indeed infer \"If the clug was not fleeked, then the clug was not snugged\" from the given statement. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nAnswer: Yes",
