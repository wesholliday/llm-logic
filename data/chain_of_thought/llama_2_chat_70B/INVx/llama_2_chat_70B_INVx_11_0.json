The contrapositive is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the flug was blummed\" and the conclusion is \"the flug was zimmed.\"\n\nStep 3: Formulate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement would be \"If the flug was not zimmed, then the flug was not blummed.\" This statement means that if the flug was not zimmed, then it must not have been blummed.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Infer the conclusion\nBased on the contrapositive statement, we can infer that \"If the flug was not blummed, then the flug was not zimmed.\" This means that if the flug was not blummed, then it must not have been zimmed.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
