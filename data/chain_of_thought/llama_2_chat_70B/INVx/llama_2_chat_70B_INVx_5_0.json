            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" It means that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled.\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nTo find the contrapositive statement, we need to switch the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. The hypothesis is \"the zinger was fraggled\" and the conclusion is \"the zinger was smoogled.\" So, the contrapositive statement would be \"If the zinger was not smoogled, then the zinger was not fraggled.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the contrapositive statement\nTo negate the contrapositive statement, we need to switch the hypothesis and conclusion again. The negated contrapositive statement would be \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nStep 4: Determine if the negated contrapositive statement is equivalent to the original statement\nThe negated contrapositive statement \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled\" is not equivalent to the original statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\" The original statement asserts that if the zinger was fraggled, then it must have been smoogled, while the negated contrapositive statement asserts that if the zinger was not fraggled, then it must have been smoogled. These two statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the zinger was not fraggled, then the zinger was not smoogled\" from the given statement \"If the zinger was fraggled, then the zinger was smoogled.\"\n\nAnswer: No",
