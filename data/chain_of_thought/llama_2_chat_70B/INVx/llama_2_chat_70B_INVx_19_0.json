            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the smonk was vreebled, then the smonk plagged.\" It means that if the smonk was in a certain state (vreebled), then it also had a certain property or characteristic (plagged).\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the smonk was vreebled\" and the conclusion is \"the smonk plagged.\" To form the contrapositive, we switch these two parts: \"If the smonk was not plagged, then the smonk was not vreebled.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement implies that if the smonk did not have the property of being plagged, then it also did not have the state of being vreebled. This seems like a reasonable inference based on the original statement.\n\nStep 4: Infer the desired statement\nNow we can infer the desired statement: \"If the smonk was not vreebled, then the smonk was not plagged.\" This follows logically from the contrapositive statement we derived in step 3.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
