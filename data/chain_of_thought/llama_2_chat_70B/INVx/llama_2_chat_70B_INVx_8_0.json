            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the sprocket was cranked, then the sprocket was daggled.\" It means that if the sprocket was turned or rotated (cranked), then it was also moved in a particular way (daggled).\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the sprocket was cranked\" and the conclusion is \"the sprocket was daggled.\" To form the contrapositive, we switch these parts: \"If the sprocket was not daggled, then the sprocket was not cranked.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement must also be true.\n\nStep 4: Infer the conclusion\nBased on the contrapositive statement, we can infer that \"If the sprocket was not cranked, then the sprocket was not daggled.\" This is because if the sprocket was not daggled, then it must mean that it was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
