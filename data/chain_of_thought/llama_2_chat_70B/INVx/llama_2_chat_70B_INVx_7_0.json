            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the whiffle was shanked, then the whiffle tinked.\" It means that if the whiffle was shanked (i.e., hit in a certain way), then it tinked (i.e., made a certain sound).\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the whiffle was shanked\" and the conclusion is \"the whiffle tinked.\" To form the contrapositive, we switch these two parts: \"If the whiffle did not tink, then it was not shanked.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the contrapositive statement\nTo negate the contrapositive statement, we need to switch its hypothesis and conclusion. The negated statement would be: \"If the whiffle did tink, then it was shanked.\"\n\nStep 4: Determine whether the negated statement is equivalent to the original statement\nThe negated statement is not equivalent to the original statement. The original statement asserts that if the whiffle was shanked, then it tinked. The negated statement, on the other hand, asserts that if the whiffle tinked, then it was shanked. These two statements are not logically equivalent because the first one talks about a cause-and-effect relationship (shanking causing tinking), while the second one talks about an inverse relationship (tinking implying shanking).\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If the whiffle was not shanked, then the whiffle did not tink\" from the given statement. The negation of the contrapositive statement does not lead to a logically equivalent statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
