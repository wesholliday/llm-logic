The contrapositive of this premise is \"If the splat did not quank, then the splat was not morphed.\"\n3. The negation of the premise is \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank.\"\n\nTherefore, we can infer \"If the splat was not morphed, then the splat did not quank\" from the given premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
