            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the glip was slogged, then the glip was tragged.\" It means that if the glip (whatever it is) was slogged, then it was definitely tragged.\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nTo find the contrapositive statement, we need to switch the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. So, the contrapositive statement would be \"If the glip was not tragged, then the glip was not slogged.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the conclusion of the original statement (the glip was tragged) is false, then the hypothesis (the glip was slogged) must also be false. Therefore, we can infer that if the glip was not tragged, then it was not slogged.\n\nStep 4: Answer the question\nAnswer: Yes, we can infer \"If the glip was not slogged, then the glip was not tragged\" from the given statement.",
