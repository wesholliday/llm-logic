            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the twonk was plinked, then it was varnished.\" This statement implies that if a twonk (whatever it is) was plinked, then it must have been varnished.\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nTo infer the statement \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished,\" we need to find the contrapositive of the given statement. The contrapositive is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the twonk was plinked\" and the conclusion is \"it was varnished.\"\n\nStep 3: Formulate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement would be \"If the twonk was not varnished, then it was not plinked.\" This statement implies that if a twonk was not varnished, then it must not have been plinked.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Infer the conclusion\nBased on the contrapositive statement, we can infer that \"If the twonk was not plinked, then it was not varnished.\" This conclusion follows logically from the original statement.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
