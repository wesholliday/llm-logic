            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the flugel was blimmed, then the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is obtained by switching the hypothesis and conclusion of the original statement. In this case, the hypothesis is \"the flugel was blimmed\" and the conclusion is \"the flugel was zargled.\"\n\nStep 3: Formulate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement would be \"If the flugel was not zargled, then the flugel was not blimmed.\"\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the conclusion of the original statement is false, then the hypothesis must also be false.\n\nStep 5: Determine whether the contrapositive statement helps to answer the question\nIn this case, the question asks whether we can infer \"If the flugel was not blimmed, then the flugel was not zargled\" from the given statement. The contrapositive statement we derived in step 3 is logically equivalent to this statement, so the answer is yes.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
