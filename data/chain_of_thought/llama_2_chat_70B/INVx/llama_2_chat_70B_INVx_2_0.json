In this case, the hypothesis is \"the wug was flooped\" and the conclusion is \"the wug bimmed the zoint.\"\n\nStep 3: Negate the hypothesis and conclusion\nNegating the hypothesis gives us \"the wug was not flooped,\" and negating the conclusion gives us \"the wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nStep 4: Form the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is \"If the wug was not flooped, then the wug did not bim the zoint.\"\n\nStep 5: Check for logical equivalence\nWe can see that the original statement and the contrapositive statement are logically equivalent, meaning that if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement must also be true, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
