In this case, the hypothesis is \"the wug was sproinged\" and the conclusion is \"it was garpled.\"\n\nStep 3: Formulate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement would be \"If the wug was not garpled, then it was not sproinged.\"\n\nStep 4: Evaluate the contrapositive statement\nThe contrapositive statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. In other words, if the original statement is true, then the contrapositive statement must also be true.\n\nStep 5: Infer the conclusion\nBased on the contrapositive statement, we can infer that \"If the wug was not sproinged, then it was not garpled.\"\n\nAnswer: Yes",
