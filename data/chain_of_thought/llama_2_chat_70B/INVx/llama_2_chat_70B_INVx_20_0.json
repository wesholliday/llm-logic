            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned.\"\n\nThis statement is in the form of a conditional tautology, where \"If A, then B\" implies that B follows logically from A. In this case, A is \"the fleeg was bluttered\" and B is \"it surned\".\n\nStep 2: Identify the contrapositive of the statement.\n\nThe contrapositive of \"If A, then B\" is \"If not B, then not A\". In this case, we can form the contrapositive by negating both sides of the original statement:\n\n\"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn.\"\n\nStep 3: Evaluate whether the contrapositive implies the desired inference.\n\nThe desired inference is \"If the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn.\" This is exactly the same as the contrapositive we formed in step 2. Therefore, we can infer that if the fleeg was not bluttered, then it did not surn.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
