This means that the whiffle did not make a sound or did not work properly.\n\nBased on the second statement, we know that if the whiffle was shanked, it would have tinked. This means that if the whiffle was hit or struck in a certain way, it would have made a sound or worked properly.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nSince the whiffle did not tink, it means that it was not shanked. If it had been shanked, it would have tinked, but it did not. Therefore, we can infer that the whiffle was not shanked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
