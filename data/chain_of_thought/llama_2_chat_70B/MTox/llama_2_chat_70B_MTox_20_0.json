            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"The fleeg did not surn\" means that the fleeg did not perform some action or have some property that would cause it to surn.\n* \"If the fleeg was bluttered, then it surned\" means that if the fleeg had a certain quality or state (being bluttered), then it would have surned.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement provides a conditional relationship between the fleeg being bluttered and the fleeg surning. In other words, if the fleeg was bluttered, then it would have surned.\n\nStep 3: Use modus tollens to draw a conclusion\n\nWe can use modus tollens to deduce a conclusion from the given information. Modus tollens is a logical rule that allows us to conclude that the antecedent (the fleeg being bluttered) cannot be true if the consequent (the fleeg surning) is false.\n\nStep 4: Draw a conclusion\n\nTherefore, since we know that the fleeg did not surn, we can conclude that the fleeg was not bluttered.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
