Premise 2 establishes a conditional relationship between fraggling and smoogling, where if the zinger was fraggled, then it was smoogled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\n\nBy combining the two premises, we can infer that the zinger was not fraggled. If the zinger were fraggled, then according to Premise 2, it would have been smoogled. However, since the zinger was not smoogled (Premise 1), it must not have been fraggled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
