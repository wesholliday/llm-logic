The first statement, \"the splat did not quank\", is a negation of the conclusion of the second statement.\n\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer that if the conclusion of the second statement (\"the splat quanked\") is false, then the premise of the second statement (\"the splat was morphed\") must also be false. Therefore, we can conclude that \"the splat was not morphed\".\n\nAnswer: Yes",
