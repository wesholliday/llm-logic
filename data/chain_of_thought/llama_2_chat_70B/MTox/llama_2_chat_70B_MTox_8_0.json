Premise 2 establishes a conditional relationship between the cranking of the sprocket and its daggling. In other words, if the sprocket was cranked, then it must have been daggled.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion based on the premises\n\nSince the sprocket was not daggled (premise 1), and being cranked implies being daggled (premise 2), we can infer that the sprocket was not cranked.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
