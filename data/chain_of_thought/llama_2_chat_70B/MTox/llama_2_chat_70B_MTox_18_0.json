Premise 2 states that if the shank was plooked, then it was nugged. To infer \"The shank was not plooked,\" we need to use modus tollens, which requires us to assume the antecedent (the shank was plooked) and deny the consequent (the shank was nugged).\n\nStep 3: Apply modus tollens.\n\nAssume the antecedent: The shank was plooked.\nDeny the consequent: The shank was not nugged (from premise 1).\nConclusion: The shank was not plooked.\n\nStep 4: Check for validity.\n\nThe argument is valid because it follows the modus tollens format, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
