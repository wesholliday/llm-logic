In this case, we can use modus tollens to infer the negation of the conclusion (the smonk did not plagged) given the negation of the premise (the smonk was not vreebled).\n\nStep 4: Draw the final conclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the given information and the application of modus tollens, we can infer that the smonk was not vreebled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
