            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given information\n\n* \"The fribble did not crink\" means that the fribble did not undergo a certain action or process that would have resulted in it crinkling.\n* \"If the fribble was snurgled, then the fribble crinked\" means that if the fribble had undergone a certain action or process called snurgling, it would have definitely crinked.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between the two statements\n\nWe can see that the second statement is a conditional statement, where the antecedent is \"the fribble was snurgled\" and the consequent is \"the fribble crinked\". The first statement, \"the fribble did not crink\", can be seen as the negation of the consequent of the second statement.\n\nStep 3: Infer the conclusion\n\nUsing modus tollens, we can infer the negation of the antecedent of the second statement, which is \"the fribble was not snurgled\". This means that since the fribble did not crink, it must mean that it was not snurgled.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
