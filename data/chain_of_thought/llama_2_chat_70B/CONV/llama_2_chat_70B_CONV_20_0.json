In other words, we need to determine if the statement is a tautology or not.\n\nStep 4: Determine the truth value of the inference\nThe statement \"If the banana was yellow, then the apple was red\" is not a tautology because it is possible for the banana to be yellow even if the apple was not red. Therefore, the inference is invalid, and we cannot conclude that the apple was red based on the fact that the banana was yellow.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question\nAnswer: No",
