In this case, they are not logically equivalent because the original statement implies that the vampire's awakening is sufficient to conclude that the mummy is awake, whereas the inverted statement only implies that the mummy's awakening is sufficient to conclude that the vampire is awake.\n\nStep 5: Answer\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"If the mummy was awake, then the vampire was awake\" from \"If the vampire was awake, then the mummy was awake\".",
