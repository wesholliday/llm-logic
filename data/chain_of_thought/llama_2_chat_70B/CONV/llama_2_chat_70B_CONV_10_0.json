The premise states that the dog's location (inside) implies the cat's location (outside).\n2. By logical equivalence, we can rewrite the premise as 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside'.\n3. Therefore, we can infer the conclusion 'If the cat was outside, then the dog was inside' from the premise 'If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside'.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
