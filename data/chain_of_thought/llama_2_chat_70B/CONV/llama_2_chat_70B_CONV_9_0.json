            "content": "\nMy reasoning is as follows:\n\n1. The premise states that if Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt. This means that the purchase of the red shirt by Lisa implies the purchase of the blue shirt by Mark.\n2. The statement we want to infer is \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt.\" This is a converse statement of the premise.\n3. According to the laws of logic, the converse of a conditional statement is also true if the original statement is true. In other words, if \"If A then B\" is true, then \"If B then A\" must also be true.\n4. Therefore, since the premise \"If Lisa bought the red shirt, then Mark bought the blue shirt\" is true, we can infer that its converse \"If Mark bought the blue shirt, then Lisa bought the red shirt\" is also true.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
