The premise \"If the doll was plastic, then the truck was metal\" implies that the doll's material (plastic) is correlated with the truck's material (metal).\n2. This correlation means that if we know the truck's material (metal), we can infer the doll's material (plastic).\n3. Therefore, the statement \"If the truck was metal, then the doll was plastic\" logically follows from the premise.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
