This statement implies that Mary's presence at the wedding guarantees Sue's presence at the wedding.\n3. However, the converse of this statement is not necessarily true. In other words, just because Sue was at the wedding, it does not necessarily mean that Mary was also at the wedding.\n4. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Sue was at the wedding, then Mary was at the wedding\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
