This is known as modus ponens, a basic rule of logic that allows us to deduce a conclusion from two premises.\n\nThe reasoning goes like this:\n\n1. If the book was written by James, then the book is a mystery novel (premise)\n2. The book is a mystery novel (assumed true for the sake of inference)\n3. Therefore, the book was written by James (conclusion)\n\nIn this argument, the first premise establishes a conditional relationship between the authorship of the book and its genre. The second premise assumes that the book is indeed a mystery novel. Using modus ponens, we can deduce the conclusion that the book was written by James.\n\nAnswer: Yes.",
