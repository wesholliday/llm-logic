This statement implies that Sam taking a plane is sufficient to conclude that Erin took a train.\n3. However, it does not necessarily imply that Erin taking a train is sufficient to conclude that Sam took a plane.\n4. In other words, there could be other reasons why Erin took a train, and we cannot assume that Sam took a plane without additional information.\n5. Therefore, we cannot infer \"If Erin took a train, then Sam took a plane\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
