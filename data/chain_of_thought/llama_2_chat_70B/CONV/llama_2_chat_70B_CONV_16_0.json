            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is \"If the shirt was cotton, then the pants were denim.\"\n\nStep 2: Identify the hypothesis and conclusion\nHypothesis: The shirt was cotton\nConclusion: The pants were denim\n\nStep 3: Evaluate the relationship between the hypothesis and conclusion\nThe statement suggests a causal relationship between the shirt being cotton and the pants being denim. It implies that whenever the shirt is cotton, the pants are likely to be denim.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the conclusion can be inferred from the hypothesis\nBased on the given statement, it seems reasonable to infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was probably cotton. The statement suggests a consistent relationship between the two, where one implies the other.\n\nStep 5: Consider any potential exceptions or counterexamples\nThere might be situations where the shirt is cotton, but the pants are not denim. For example, the pants could be made of another material, such as polyester or wool. However, these exceptions do not necessarily invalidate the inference.\n\nStep 6: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the given statement and the reasoning above, it seems reasonable to infer that if the pants were denim, then the shirt was likely cotton.\n\nAnswer: Yes",
