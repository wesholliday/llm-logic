In this case, the conclusions are \"The unicorn was in the forest\" and \"The griffin was not in the forest,\" respectively. These conclusions are not the same, so the statements are not logically equivalent.\n\nStep 6: Answer the question\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"If the unicorn was in the forest, then the griffin was in the forest\" from the given statement.",
