            "content": "\nStep 1: Understand the given statement\nThe given statement is a conditional statement in the form \"If A, then B.\" It means that the truth of statement B (Lucy went to the zoo) is dependent on the truth of statement A (Joe went to the park).\n\nStep 2: Analyze the relationship between A and B\nThe relationship between A and B is inverse. In other words, if A is true, then B must be false, and if B is true, then A must be false.\n\nStep 3: Draw a conclusion\nBased on the inverse relationship between A and B, we can infer that if B (Lucy went to the zoo) is true, then A (Joe went to the park) must be false. Therefore, we can infer the contrapositive statement \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did go to the park.\"\n\nStep 4: Check if the conclusion is equivalent to the original statement\nThe conclusion we drew is not equivalent to the original statement. The original statement was \"If Joe went to the park, then Lucy went to the zoo,\" while our conclusion was \"If Lucy did not go to the zoo, then Joe did go to the park.\" These two statements are not logically equivalent, as the first one implies a direct relationship between Joe and Lucy's actions, while the second one implies an inverse relationship.\n\nTherefore, we cannot infer \"If Lucy went to the zoo, then Joe went to the park\" from the given statement.\n\nAnswer: No",
