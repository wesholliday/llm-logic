In other words, if statement A is true, then statement B must be false, and if statement B is true, then statement A must be false.\n\nStep 3: Determine if the converse of the given statement is true\nThe converse of the given statement is \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball.\" To determine if this statement is true, we need to examine the relationship between the two statements again.\n\nStep 4: Apply the inverse relationship\nSince the relationship between the two statements is inverse, we can infer that if Amy played tennis, then Jeff did not play basketball. In other words, the converse of the given statement is false.\n\nStep 5: Answer the question\nAnswer: No, we cannot infer \"If Amy played tennis, then Jeff played basketball\" from the given statement.",
