    "user_prompt": "Suppose that tidal power, solar power, and wind power are the leading renewable energy sources. Forecasts indicate it\u2019s likely tidal power will generate the most electricity this year, followed by solar power, with wind power capacity lagging significantly behind. These are the only major sources, so if solar power doesn\u2019t generate the most electricity, then if tidal power doesn\u2019t, wind power will. Moreover, tidal power likely will generate the most electricity and hence solar power likely won't. Does it follow that it's likely that, if tidal power doesn't generate the most electricity, wind power will?",
