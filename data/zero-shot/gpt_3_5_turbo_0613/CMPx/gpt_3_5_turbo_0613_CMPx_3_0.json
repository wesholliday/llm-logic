    "user_prompt": "Suppose that a tropin, a loment, and a dralid are the top scoring vilcants this season. Experts expect the tropin likely will have the highest vilcant rate, followed by the loment, with the dralid significantly lower. These lead the vilcants, so if the loment doesn\u2019t have the top vilcant rate, then if the tropin doesn\u2019t, the dralid will. Moreover, the tropin likely will lead in vilcants and hence the loment likely won\u2019t. Does it follow that it is likely that, if the tropin doesn\u2019t lead in vilcants, the dralid will?",
