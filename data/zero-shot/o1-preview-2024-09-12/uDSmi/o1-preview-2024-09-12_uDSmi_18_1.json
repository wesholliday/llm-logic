Based on the given information, we can infer that the notebook is in the drawer.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Premise 1:** Either the notebook is in the drawer (D), or it must be sitting on the nightstand (N). This can be expressed logically as:\n   \\[ D \\lor N \\]\n   \n2. **Premise 2:** The notebook might not be sitting on the nightstand. This means it's possible that the notebook is **not** on the nightstand, so \\( N \\) might be false.\n\n3. If \\( N \\) is false (the notebook is not on the nightstand), then according to Premise 1, \\( D \\) must be true (the notebook is in the drawer).\n\nTherefore, since there's a possibility that the notebook is not on the nightstand, we can conclude that the notebook is in the drawer.",
