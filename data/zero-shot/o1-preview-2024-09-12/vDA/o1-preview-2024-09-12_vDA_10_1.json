The argument commits a logical fallacy known as \"denying the antecedent.\" Here's the structure of the argument:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: If the dog was inside, then the cat was outside.\n2. **Premise 2**: The dog was not inside.\n3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the cat was not outside.\n\nIn symbolic terms, the argument can be represented as:\n\n1. If \\( P \\), then \\( Q \\).\n2. Not \\( P \\).\n3. Therefore, not \\( Q \\).\n\nDenying the antecedent assumes that if the first condition is false, then the second condition must also be false. However, the original conditional statement only tells us what happens when the first condition is true; it doesn't provide information about what happens when the first condition is false. Therefore, the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.",
