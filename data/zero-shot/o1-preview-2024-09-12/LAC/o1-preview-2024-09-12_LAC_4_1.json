This is because knowing that \"If the alien visited Mars, then the robot visited Jupiter\" and \"The robot visited Jupiter\" does not allow us to conclude that \"The alien visited Mars.\" This reasoning is an example of the logical fallacy known as **affirming the consequent**. Just because the robot visited Jupiter doesn't necessarily mean the alien visited Mars; the robot might have visited Jupiter independently of the alien's actions.",
