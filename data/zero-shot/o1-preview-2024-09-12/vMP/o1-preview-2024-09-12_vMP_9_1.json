In modus ponens, if we have a conditional statement \"If P, then Q\" and we know that P is true, we can logically conclude that Q must also be true. In this case:\n\n1. **Premise 1**: If Lisa bought the red shirt (P), then Mark bought the blue shirt (Q).\n2. **Premise 2**: Lisa bought the red shirt (P is true).\n3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, Mark bought the blue shirt (Q is true).\n\nThis logical reasoning is valid because it correctly applies the rules of deductive logic.",
