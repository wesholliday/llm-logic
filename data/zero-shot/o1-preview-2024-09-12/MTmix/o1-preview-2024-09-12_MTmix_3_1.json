That is, there's a possibility that \\( \\neg Q \\).\n\nGiven that \\( \\text{Morphed} \\rightarrow \\text{Quanked} \\), if there's a possibility that the splat did not quank (\\( \\neg \\text{Quanked} \\) is possible), then there must be a possibility that the splat was not morphed. However, from a possibility, we cannot conclude certainty.\n\nBut the first statement says that if the splat was morphed, then it **must** have quanked. The use of \"must\" indicates that quanking is a necessary consequence of morphing.\n\nSince there's a possibility that the splat did **not** quank, and quanking necessarily follows from morphing, the only way for the splat to possibly not have quanked is if it was **not** morphed.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that the splat was not morphed.",
