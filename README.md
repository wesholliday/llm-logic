## Supplementary Material for "Conditional and Modal Reasoning in Large Language Models"

This repository contains the supplementary material for the paper "Conditional and Modal Reasoning in Large Language Models" by Wesley H. Holliday (wesholliday@berkeley.edu) and Matthew Mandelkern (mandelkern@nyu.edu).

### Contents

- `llm-logic.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing all the code used to run the experiments and generate the graphs presented in the paper.

- `prompts/`: Includes all of the inference pattern questions used in the experiments.

- `data/`: Stores the LLM responses to the inference pattern questions.

- `graphs/` and `results/`: These directories are generated upon running the "llm-logic" notebook and contain the graphs and results of experiments, respectively.

### Usage

To replicate the experiments or explore the results, open and run the "llm-logic.ipynb" Jupyter notebook.

### Contact

For any queries related to the paper or the supplementary material, please write to wesholliday@berkeley.edu.
